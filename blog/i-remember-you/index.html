        <p>I meant to post last on the 15th but I just couldn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I should blog. It just didn&rsquo;t feel right to do so. Even now, I&rsquo;m not so comfortable posting this but I just need to get it out, which is why it&rsquo;s private. Only three people have the password to my private posts so I guess it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>

<p>On the 15th I received a text from a friend asking about our mutual friend, T.</p>

<p>T&rsquo;s one of my closest guy friends whom I affectionly call Muffin. We went to the same junior high together and we both excelled at the extreme sport of procrastination. I told Muffin everything about life. I trusted him with all my secrets. However, within the past year I haven&rsquo;t really talked to him that much. We&rsquo;d see each other in the halls and say a quick &ldquo;Hi how are you?&rdquo; and go on to our classes. Sometimes there was a hug. Him ruffling my hair. Poking each others sides. The usual friendship shenanigans.</p>

<p>So my friend asked if I had talked to Muffin lately and to check his Facebook page. I said no and proceeded to look at his wall on Facebook. There was a single post that I saw right away. It was a RIP message from his sister. At first I couldn&rsquo;t really believe it. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s a practical joke or something.&rdquo; But as people started commenting and more wall posts began to appear, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t a joke. Somehow, I had a small shred of hope that maybe, just maybe, it was a joke after all.</p>

<p>Still, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep right away that night. I cried and prayed that this wasn&rsquo;t real. When I walked into the band room for practice this morning, I felt like throwing up. His sister, M, is in band and plays the flute, just like me. She&rsquo;s the sweetest girl I know and she&rsquo;s always smiling. So when I saw her crying, I was filled with dread. It wasn&rsquo;t a joke. T&rsquo;s really gone.</p>

<p>Me and my friend A didn&rsquo;t say anything but we went over and hugged her. I tried to keep myself from crying because it would just be selfish of me. It was so hard, especially when M started shaking in my arms as she sobbed. The only thought in my head was, &ldquo;T, why did you leave her behind, this sweet little girl who just loves you to death? What happened to make you leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, I didn&rsquo;t really know what happened exactly but I had a vague feeling. I still don&rsquo;t like to say it because it just makes me shiver all over.</p>

<p>First period comes and goes and then it&rsquo;s time for second period. While my teacher was explaining every single meaning of every single sentence and word and punctuation mark of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, another teacher walks in and gives her a sheet of paper. A troubled looked crossed over my teacher&rsquo;s face and she sighed. I clenched my jaw and buried my head into my book.</p>

<p>Half an hour passes and my principal&rsquo;s voice comes onto the intercom, &ldquo;Please excuse this interruption. Teachers please read out the handout you just received. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We learned that over the weekend that T.W. passed away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ground my teeth so that my mouth wouldn&rsquo;t wobble or let out a cry. It was official. Really official this time. I spent the rest of the period trying not to cry. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that Muffin was gone.</p>

<p>After that the week went well actually. I tried not to think about it during the day, and it worked. I said my prayers for him every night.</p>

<p>Friday was the funeral.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to a funeral so I was scared. I was bit late but I managed to see two of my friends who I stood next to the whole time. It was crowded. I kind of expected it. Muffin has a lot friends. He was just so outgoing and cheerful and kind that all kinds of people flocked to him. So we literally stood a few inches away from the entrance where tons of over people where standing as well for the whole time.</p>

<p>Muffin&rsquo;s friend, appropriately nicknamed Cupcake, made a speech. It was wonderful. So many memories flooded into my mind at the time. I giggled at some of the hilarious teenage shenanigans and cried at the parts when it seemed like Cupcake couldn&rsquo;t hold it together. But he did and I never felt so proud for him. This is cheesy, but I was filled with love for some reason.</p>

<p>As it came to a close, I had a sudden urge to see his face. One last time. But I was in the back and I couldn&rsquo;t make it to see him in time. Maybe it was better if I didn&rsquo;t. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have handled it.</p>

<p>When they brought out the coffin, all the emotions I held in that past week burst out of me. I sobbed into my friend&rsquo;s shoulder as I watched as his best friend since the age of seven carried the coffin into the hearse. As I watched as his father quietly sobbed in his arm as the other men held him. As I saw his sister turn her head away and cry out loud. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Was that really Muffin in that coffin? What was his expression? And as silly as this sounds, was it really him? I was filled with immense sorrow and anger at that moment. Anger at myself, anger at him, anger towards whatever had caused this&hellip; I still kind of am but now it&rsquo;s considerably less.</p>

<p>After the hearse drove away, I made me way to say my condolences. All I could say was &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while&rdquo; and I hugged Cupcake for the longest time. I suddenly realized how long it was since I talked to him and how long it was since I told anyone any of my secrets. Then I went to hug Muffin&rsquo;s sister. It was a quick one. I don&rsquo;t know her that well. She looked at me and with the bravest and strongest face I have ever seen she said, &ldquo;If you want anything of Tai&rsquo;s, let me know.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s another topic entirely.</p>

<p>I lingered around. Hugged. Cried. Said good byes. I left feeling better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit unsettled. The halls seem emptier. I miss him. But little by little, I&rsquo;m getting used to it. I&rsquo;m not sure about his family though, especially his sister. They must have it so hard. I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine it. For now, I&rsquo;m going to pray for him and his family. I hope he can hear my prayers.</p>
