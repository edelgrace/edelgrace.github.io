      <description>Disclaimer: Spoilers abound!
  Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World by Haruki Murakami     Hyperkinetic and relentlessly inventive, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World is Haruki Murakami&amp;rsquo;s deep dive into the very nature of consciousness.
Across two parallel narratives, Murakami draws readers into a mind-bending universe in which Lauren Bacall, Bob Dylan, a split-brained data processor, a deranged scientist, his shockingly undemure granddaughter, and various thugs, librarians, and subterranean monsters collide to a dazzling effect.</description>

 Have you ever had a bookish, nocturnal dream? If so, please share the story. If not, have you ever had a daydream related to books? If so, please tell us about it.
 Strangely enough, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any bookish dreams.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is not a concert review and this post contains swearing
One of the things on my 25 before 25 bucket list was to go see a concert. The last concert I went to when I made my bucket list was the Japanese band Lix at an anime convention back in 2012 (but that slipped my mind when I wrote it and I said the last concert I went to was a My Chemical Romance concert).</description>

 Do you agree or disagree with this statement: A blogger&amp;rsquo;s first name should be in a prominent place on his/her blog.
 I definitely agree! Even if the name is an alias, putting a name to the blog can do wonders in making a blog feel more personable.</description>

      <description>Tamen De Gushi, Chapter 124    I was scrolling through Tumblr when I saw that one of my friends had posted a comic strip from a Chinese comic that I used to follow. It&amp;rsquo;s called Tamen De Gushi or in English, Their Story. The comic follows two girls, Sun Jing and Qiu who fall in love and start dating. Overall, the comic is very sweet, uplifting, and wholesome.</description>

 What&amp;rsquo;s your proudest blogging milestone or achievement?
 I think the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blog for so long is an achievement. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging since 2007, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for over ten years now. I remember blogging on a platform called Mibba.</description>

 Does a cluttered blog have you not returning? By cluttered I mean too many columns, small type, too many photos, difficult to follow, etc.
 Interestingly, I rarely visit blogs anymore. I only ever really visit a blog when a blog I am subscribed to pops up on my RSS reader and I feel compelled to comment on it.</description>

 If you were stranded on a deserted island, which ONE book could you not live without?
 OH MAN. This is such a hard question. Would I bring my favourite book, Vilette by Charlotte Brontë? I&amp;rsquo;ve only read it once, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I could read it more than a couple of times.</description>

      <description>Last month, I finally graduated from university. It took me six years to finish university: one year of engineering, four years of computer science, and one year of internship. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent nearly a quarter of my life as an undergraduate.
I remember starting out my first year so optimistic. Engineering classes were so brutal and every week I resolved to start anew. But I really hated those classes except for the software and electrical course.</description>

 Do you have an Instagram account? If so, do you only follow book folks?
 I do have an Instagram account! Shameless plug, @edelgraceme.
The people I follow are usually my friends. Sometimes I follow some comic artists because I enjoy some humor every now and then.</description>

 For a hot moment, I wanted to buy all the editions of Vilette by Charlotte Brontë that I could.</description>

 What author have you read the most in the past two years?
 Not including manga artists, that would by Ursula K. Le Guin.
I just happened to come across Le Guin by chance. I was itching to read some sci-fi but I was daunted by all the thick hardcover volumes at my local library.</description>

 What were your worst movies based off of books?
 WARNING: Spoilers for My Sister&amp;rsquo;s Keeper by Jodi Picoult.
When I go to see a movie based off a book, I don&amp;rsquo;t go in with high expectations. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Harry Potter nerd by any stretch of imagination so those movies didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me despite their departures from the source material.</description>

 I don&amp;rsquo;t like comparing books to children. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible for me to be impartial to a book. Every book deserves to be judged, simply because it exists.</description>

What I read Last Week I finally finished reading David Allen&amp;rsquo;s Getting Things Done! I&amp;rsquo;ve always heard about the infamous GTD method and finally decided to read the book. I am not sure if I want to write a review for it yet because I can&amp;rsquo;t really judge how well the process works before I actually implement it.</description>

      <description>Summary February felt so short! Shorter than usual. I suppose it always feels this short because February is short already. Also, Reading Week is a week where we have the entire week off so it&amp;rsquo;s inherently less productive due to the less hours.
I started using Todoist as my organizational system but we&amp;rsquo;ll see whether or not it sticks. So far I like it. But I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the premium version and I might have to pay for it soon&amp;hellip; Not looking forward to that.</description>

 Off the book topic&amp;hellip;do you use a mouse pad? If so, what is on it?
 I do not use a mouse pad! I don&amp;rsquo;t even own a mouse pad. I just use whatever surface I&amp;rsquo;m using for a mouse pad.</description>

      <description>WIP stands for a &amp;ldquo;work in progress.&amp;rdquo; As an avid crafter and generally creative person, I always have at least one WIP!
 This year I&amp;rsquo;m doing a temperature blanket for real. My inspiration comes from Sakaane who is also doing a temperature blanket. I deliberated over how I wanted to make the blanket. I already had a ton of squares but I know myself too well. I would never get around to joining all those squares and weaving in all those ends.</description>

      <description>Last week was the start of Reading Week. Reading Week is basically my university&amp;rsquo;s version of &amp;ldquo;midterm break&amp;rdquo; where we have a week off. I don&amp;rsquo;t have classes on Friday so my Reading Week started early.
Penguins On Friday, my boyfriend and I went to the zoo. We really wanted to see the penguins and the red pandas. Every day, the penguins take a walk around the zoo. It was adorable.</description>

 Do you read hardcovers with the dust jacket on or off? Why or why not?
 Sometimes, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice. A good number of books I read are from the library. If a hardcover has a dust jacket, it&amp;rsquo;s gauranteed that the dust jacket is taped to the covers.</description>

 Have you ever found yourself acting like a favorite character in a novel? If so, which one?
 Not at all! The only time I find myself acting like anyone other than myself is if I&amp;rsquo;m acting like my friends as a result of months of exposure to their quirks and traits.</description>

      <description>The Unreal and the Real Volume One: Where on Earth     For fifty years, National Book Award winner Ursula K. Le Guin’s stories have shaped the way her readers see the world. Her work gives voice to the voiceless, hope to the outsider, and speaks truth to power. Le Guin’s writing is witty, wise, both sly and forthright; she is a master craftswoman.
This two-volume selection of almost forty stories taken from her eleven collections was made by Le Guin herself, as was the organizing principle of splitting the stories into the nominally realistic and fantastic.</description>

      <description>The Knitting Sutra     When Susan Gordon Lydon was coping with a broken arm, her craft took on new significance. While knitting was essential to strengthening her hands, it also provided her with a newfound sense of peace and creativity. Immersed in brilliant colors, textures, and images of beautiful sweaters, Lydon found healing and enlightenment in a way she had never imagined. Capturing this journey of discovery, The Knitting Sutra recounts her remarkable membership in a community of craftswomen around the world, from sweater makers in Scotland to Navajo weavers, and the adventures that her craft led her on.</description>

      <description>Warning: Spoilers for both Life is Strange Season 1 and *Life is Strange: Before the Storm*
In Life is Strange Season 1, Racher Amber is a mystery. If you walk around and talk to the locals, everyone (including those with less than stellar personalities) has nothing to say but praises about Rachel. Throughout the game, Rachel is built up to be perfect to everyone you speak to. The artists loved to try to capture her essence, the nerds enjoyed her intellectual prowess, and the popular kids enjoyed partying it up with her.</description>

 Do you prefer to blog about (a) specific book genre(s), or do you have an eclectic blog?
 I read a lot of genres and therefore my blog reflects that. So yes, I have an eclectic blog! When I pick books to read, I don&amp;rsquo;t consciously pick something by the genre.</description>

This year my SO introduced me to Westworld, a TV series that recently had their first (and last?) season end. Westworld is a highly advanced Western theme park populated with extremely life-like robots that cater to every want of their guests. It is rife of violence, alcohol, sex, and whatever you could imagine in the wild West.</description>

      <description>My last semester was extremely busy. So busy that I spent my commute on the train sleeping everyday instead of my usual reading. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, most of my reading is done when I&amp;rsquo;m on the train. So other than the occasional manga or cookbook, I hardly read the last couple months of last year. Which is devastating.
This year (like every year), I resolved to read more. I started out the year reading two non-fictional books about personal finance.</description>

I definitely struggle with impulse spending. Any physical item that I have bought, I have usually bought it on impulse. Food is the same way. It isn&amp;rsquo;t until I see something in the food court or on display that I think, &amp;ldquo;I would like that.</description>

      <description>I went back to school today. It&amp;rsquo;s a little weird to be back at school but also familiar. This semester is going to be a light one. I&amp;rsquo;m only taking two courses. One course is only five days long. So essentially I just have one course throughout the semester!
The block week course I&amp;rsquo;m taking right now is just a history course but it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting. I&amp;rsquo;ve always found history fascinating but I was never great at being tested on or writing about history.</description>

      <description>In my last post I talked about making my boyfriend a scarf. I started it yesterday after showing him a couple of sample swatches. Out of all the scarves I showed him, he liked this one of a crochet Outline Ribbed Scarf. It&amp;rsquo;s a rather simple scarf which is nice because it&amp;rsquo;ll work up quickly. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the scarf by his birthday.
Here are some pictures of the test swatches I made.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s my boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday coming up soon. I wanted to make him a knitted or a crocheted item because I need something to keep my hands busy. Plus aren&amp;rsquo;t handmade things the sweetest thing you could get as a present??
On some level, I know he&amp;rsquo;s a little picky about what kind of things he would like to wear. To avoid spending a ton of time working on something that he might not ever wear, I sent him a couple links to patterns of scarves and toques.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with Hugo lately. A couple of weeks ago, I exported my old Wordpress blog into Hugo. While I am happy with the results, it&amp;rsquo;s taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I&amp;rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.
So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site.</description>

      <description>I follow the blog baty.net in which Jack Baty continuously finds new tools and new ways to improve his productivity. While I usually scoff at people who are always changing things up, I will admit that I am the exact same way. It would be great to just stick to something tried and true and never have to think about changing but there is just so much out there that it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to resist the temptation to not try everything I can see.</description>

      <description>FO stands for &amp;ldquo;finished object.&amp;rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</description>

      <description>Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &amp;#8216;plant-like&amp;rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&amp;rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&amp;rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!
Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn.</description>

      <description>I recently started learning how to use emacs, which is a text editor and a Lisp interpreter. During my quest for resources, I came across a number of developers and their blogs. Since I&amp;rsquo;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&amp;rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t really know yet who this blanket will be for. My mom keeps asking me and I can&amp;rsquo;t make up my mind. I am pretty happy that I am making progress on this blanket. I might need three cakes for this though and not the two that I have.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Yesterday opened up at their new location across the street. I dragged my brother along with me to the opening.
It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&amp;rsquo;t win anything from but that&amp;rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&amp;rsquo;s great!</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I went to Drumheller with the family. Up to this point I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&amp;rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&amp;rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</description>

      <description>Honestly, Stampede is synonymous with food for me. Stampede means free breakfasts for a week. Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&amp;rsquo;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</description>

Ammar is a sheikh whose guidance Ramy seeks, and whose tolerance is tested by his belief in the teachings of the Qur&amp;rsquo;an. Full of quiet moments of beauty and raw depictions of violence, God in Pink poignantly captures the anguish and the fortitude of Islamic life in Iraq.</description>

      <description>FO means &amp;ldquo;finished object&amp;rdquo; in crochet and knitter terms. So any completed project is a finished object!
 After making my first granny square, I quickly made my second granny square. Both were made from Loop &amp;amp; Threads yarn of the wool variety. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact name of the yarn.
I am not quite sure about the colour choices but they were the colours I had on hand of the same yarn.</description>

      <description>Since I recently started making a temperature blanket. I bought a couple of skeins of yarn (Bernat Premium, they are so soft!) and decided to wind them into balls to make transporting them easier for when/if I&amp;rsquo;m on the go. Surprisingly, it takes a while for them to wind up. I thought it was a perfect opportunity to watch some TV shows while doing it.
I decided to finish up watching season 2 of Knights of Sidonia, an anime about a human space colony at war with alien-like creatures.</description>

      <description>The past couple of weeks I noticed that the MySQL service on my server would routinely stop out of the blue. At first I suspected that it was because my 512MB RAM wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough but when I looked at the usage history, I never peaked more than 9%. I even tried reinstalling the MySQL server which worked at first but then it stopped running again.
However, I think the problem was due to bots trying to log into my WordPress dashboard.</description>

The breakfast wasn&amp;rsquo;t busy at all but maybe being fairly early was a factor. They only served pancakes and sausage patties but they were pretty good! There was also a Tim Hortons truck giving out free coffee and hot chocolate.</description>

The middle colour represents the low of the day and the outer colour represents the high of the day. The first three days of July were roughly the same but the fourth was a little bit cooler.</description>

      <description>I am just starting to get into knitting as well and I decided to buy a relatively cheap set of bamboo knitting needles. I found this LIHAO Bamboo set on Amazon for around $16.99 CAD. Included are 18 pairs of needles ranging from 2.0mm to 10.0mm. It also came with a knitting gauge which is super helpful!
From a quick look over, there are no obvious defects. The reviews say that they are perfect for beginners so we&amp;rsquo;ll see!</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a nice store. In the back there&amp;rsquo;s a big table available for classes and (I&amp;rsquo;m assuming) to just knit or crochet.</description>

I decided to finally visit The Knitting Room for the first time and came away with some yarn!</description>

      <description>After thirty years of marriage, producing three now-grown children, Mike and Anna have settled into entrenched domesticity. She is skillful and poised and still beautiful, an instructor of English at the city college. He is a successful graphic artist on the verge of retirement, his awards and ambitions and accomplishments largely behind him. Though the couple’s erotic life has dimmed somewhat, he still considers her ravishing.
But their apparent balance is thrown asunder when Anna breaks the normal silence of their breakfast table with uncontrollable babble about hummingbirds.</description>

The store itself is very cozy and quaint. It&amp;rsquo;s literally a small house filled to the brim with yarn. The people at the front desk are extremely nice and while I was waiting for class to start, they offered me some tea.</description>

      <description>To many readers, who have perhaps known Frankenstein only at second hand, the original may well come as a surprise. When Mary Shelley began it, she was only eighteen, though she was already Shelley&amp;rsquo;s mistress and Byron&amp;rsquo;s friend. In her preface she explains how she and Shelley spent part of a wet summer with Byron in Switzerland, amusing themselves by reading and writing ghost stories. Her contribution was Frankenstein, a story about a student of natural philosophy who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from bones he has collected in charnel-houses.</description>

 When you feature a book in your posts, do you include a book cover?
 I definitely try my best to do so. It seems a little weird to write a blog post about a book without featuring the cover.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a cool hip place at the edge of Calgary&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown and across Eau Claire Market called Cafe Blanca. They&amp;rsquo;re most known for their Siphon coffee which I unfortunately did not remember to try. Instead, I ordered a plain normal latte and a cheesecake.

Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not cheesecake expert but I&amp;rsquo;m definitely a cheesecake lover. I got myself a mint chocolate cheesecake. It was extremely delicious. It was a little more cake than I prefer (the base was an actual chocolate cake and yes, cake, not brownie) and not as much cheese as I&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>

      <description>My previous FO was part of the March National Crochet Month and this one is no different. Except this event is a charity run. This square will be going to a charity to be part of a blanket! Different squares from different people will all be sewn together. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a cool joint effort!

It took me a swatch to get the hang of making a granny square. Thankfully the process is straightforward.</description>

      <description>For more than four decades, Ursula K. Le Guin has enthralled readers with her imagination, clarity, and moral vision. The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, and five Hugo and five Nebula Awards, this renowned writer has, in each story and novel, created a provocative, ever-evolving universe filled with diverse worlds and rich characters reminiscent of our earthly selves.
Now, in The Birthday of the World, this gifted artist returns to these worlds in eight brilliant short works, including a never-before-published novella, each of which probes the essence of humanity.</description>

There were times I fell a little behind the clues but I managed to finish it off! Honestly, I find it a little bit derpy but that&amp;rsquo;s part of it&amp;rsquo;s charm.</description>

      <description>I decided to make a baby blanket for my cousin who is due in June. I bought a ton of Bernat Blanket skeins for this project. There is a big sale going on at Michael&amp;rsquo;s so I kept getting discount after discount. Which is good because I could never imagine buying this many skeins of Bernat Blanket at full price. I may have actually bought too many. I did buy one skein at Walmart though.</description>

Floppy disk inserted, computer turned on, a whirring, and then this sentence, followed by a blinking cursor. So begins Suspended, the first computer game to obsess seven-year-old Michael, to worm into his head and change his sense of reality. Thirty years later he will write: &amp;ldquo;Computer games have taught me the things you can&amp;rsquo;t learn from people.&amp;rdquo;
Gamelife is the memoir of a childhood transformed by technology.</description>

      <description>I made this little bag mostly while playing the MMO Blade &amp;amp; Soul, hence the title &amp;ldquo;Perpetually Loading.&amp;rdquo; My computer is a bit of a toaster so I managed to get a lot of crocheting done while on the loading screen. Sometimes my game would crash on the loading screen and that would mean even more crocheting for me! Unfortunately, this worked out to the disadvantage of my SO who I was playing with at the time.</description>

That day we went to Yuk Yuk&amp;rsquo;s Comedy Club which is a few minutes walk from Victoria Park Stampede. We were really confused about the food since there was no (or incorrect) information on the website.</description>

Okay, this is actually my second Michael&amp;rsquo;s yarn trip but the first time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy a single thing. I just went to check out the place and see the different kinds of brands they had.</description>

The impulsive match-making of Emma Woodhouse delivers both humor and heartache through the gorgeous artwork of manga-ka Po Tse (Manga Classics: Pride and Prejudice). &amp;#8211; Manga Classics editions feature classic stories, faithfully adapted and illustrated in manga style, and available in both hardcover and softcover editions.</description>

      <description>This next dishcloth I made was a simple green dishcloth with single crochets. What initially drew me to the pattern was that the texture of the dishcloth was very pretty. I was surprised to know that the variance in texture was simple due to changing which loop you inserted the hook in! While it isn&amp;rsquo;t completely perfect, by the time I finished this I felt a lot more confident in my single crochets.</description>

      <description>My SO and I have been playing an MMO called Blade and Soul recently. We were optmistic about it running on my laptop because the requirements didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too intensive and it even supported Windows 7.
It would crash at every single loading screen. Playing on the lowest settings in a 800&amp;#215;600 window lowered the number of crashes greatly but the loading times were still absolutely ridiculous. I even managed to finish crocheting a bag while waiting for the game to load.</description>

It was good timing too because the event started the next day. I was getting a little worried that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t arrive in time.
Despite the discount I got on the yarn due specifically to the CAT (the CAT was sponsored by this brand, I think), it was kind of pricey for me.</description>

      <description>Amity provides a window to the wreckage caused by wars—the destruction and displacement that leave pain and life-long psychological disorders, here specifically within the contexts of Yugoslavia’s dissolution and Iran’s revolution.
Payvand, an Iranian refugee and activist, still plagued with nightmares, meets a Ragusa, a Yugoslavian refugee whose pockets are loaded with stones as she prepares to walk into the water and end her life, a life that has become intolerable since the loss of those most dear to her.</description>

There was art on every single floor of the building (of which there are over ten floors) and almost every single wall has a piece of art hanging on it.</description>

Unfortunately, they shipped it separate from the hooks but I had bought yarn from Walmart in the meantime while waiting for my things to arrive.
So here is the skein of yarn I got from Amazon.</description>

I know the colours are kind of garish but I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d be using them together until I actually started working on it. I can see some of the mistakes I made, and there are many, but I am extremely happy with how it turned out and I had a lot of fun making it.</description>

Scrolling through the list, I found that most of the coffee places closed at 5:00PM or 6:00PM. I needed a place to sit and blog hop for a little bit so that was no good.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, I recently took up learning how to crochet. Since March is National Crochet Month, &amp;nbsp;I decided to take part in some of the activities that are being held at Ravelry.
MCAL (Mystery Crochet Along)
This is an event that reveals the pattern slowly, clue by clue. The only hint is that it&amp;rsquo;s an anigurumi made out of three colours. This will be my first amigurumi so I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited but also anxious that it won&amp;rsquo;t turn out well.</description>

      <title>Crochet Haul #2: Cheap Crochet Set</title>
      <link>http://edelgrace.me/blog/crochet-haul-2-cheap-crochet-set/</link>

      <guid>http://edelgrace.me/blog/crochet-haul-2-cheap-crochet-set/</guid>
      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m just starting out with crocheting, I bought a somewhat cheap crochet set on Amazon. I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to buy high end luxury tools if I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I want to continue crocheting. I do think it would be a worthy hobby to take part in!
The case itself is seriously cute. The brand seems to be Merrywindix but I can&amp;rsquo;t quite tell. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot smaller than I expected which is great, that means it&amp;rsquo;s extremely portable.</description>

      <title>One Hour of Path of Exile as a Non-Gamer</title>

      <guid>http://edelgrace.me/blog/one-hour-of-path-of-exile-as-a-non-gamer/</guid>
      <description>Now I know that one hour is not enough to fully judge a game, especially for an online game which is supposed to be an extremely huge time sink. However, being someone who is not exactly the ideal demographic for this genre (I prefer turn based games like Fire Emblem, walking simulators like Life is Strange, open sandboxes like Minecraft, and RPGs like Mass Effect), one hour is just enough for me to have an idea of whether or not I would like the game.</description>

      <description>The fine folks at Skacel Knitting are hosting a series they call &amp;ldquo;Crochet Along Together&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;CAT&amp;rdquo; for short. They post videos throughout the month to walk you through the project. A draw is also held after the project is finished.
March CAT
This is their very first installment and is geared towards (but not limited to) beginners to crochet. The project for this months is the Easy As 1-2-3 Cowl which is a three colour cowl.</description>

 How do you feel about books with multiple narrators? Submitted by Eli @ The Book Supplier
 I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t mind them nor do I have a preference towards them. My opinion isn&amp;rsquo;t fresh as I haven&amp;rsquo;t read a book with multiple narrators in a long time.</description>

      <description>Right now I&amp;rsquo;m in a quest to find a hobby that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve sitting in front of a screen. I recently started learning the guitar and now I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to add crocheting onto my plate. I have always been secretly envious of those who can knit and/or crochet. I love it when someone busts out a project their working on while on the bus and train. I also adore the small little crocheted toys that I see around the net.</description>

      <description>I finally got to watch Arrival the other day. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly everything that I expected but I think I wasn&amp;rsquo;t displeased with the twist.
The fist half of the movie follows Louise, a professor who specializes in languages and translations. She is recruited by the government to help translate the language of aliens who had touched down on earth. Together with a mathematician, Ian, they slowly learn the writing system of the aliens.</description>

      <description>I have been following Justin Guitar&amp;#8216;s lesson plans for learning the guitar.
This week I went through the first 15 beginner&amp;rsquo;s course lessons, BC-101 to BC-115. I learned the basics of choosing a guitar, posture, etc. In terms of actually playing, I learned the D chord, A chord, and E chord. The first two chords were incredibly &amp;ldquo;easy.&amp;rdquo; The chord that really stumped me was the E chord. I could not press down on the strings hard enough so that it didn&amp;rsquo;t sound muted.</description>

      <description>I can count the number of times I have tried to make cheesecake on one hand. It&amp;rsquo;s not that many but I count that as a quest to make the ultimate cheesecake. It&amp;rsquo;s my favourite dessert. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly filling and calorie dense and expensive but I love it. The expensiveness factor is a big reason why I&amp;rsquo;m trying to perfect the art of the cheesecake.
On my first attempt back in high school, it tasted lke cream cheese on a graham cracker crust.</description>

      <description>Last weekend my SO and I found ourselves at the mall. He needed to buy hand cream for his climber hands and I was there along for the ride and to possibly look for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day chocolate (no, I did not find any chocolate). We decided to stop at the Microsoft Store and try the Vive demo.
It was super cool.

I got the chance to play Job Simulator and a couple of other games.</description>

      <title>Being Depressed in a Relationship</title>

      <description>Disclimer: This blog post does not give any advice.
What really irks me is when people say that those who are depressed don&amp;rsquo;t deserve or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in a relationship. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m depressed myself and in a relationship that it&amp;rsquo;s a touchy subject for me.
However , I can see some of the reasoning. In my own experience, dealing with depression while being in a relationship has its own set of challenges.</description>

      <title>Is it Possible to Read Too Much?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in a weird place where I&amp;rsquo;m reading a lot but I&amp;rsquo;m unsure if I&amp;rsquo;m feeling depressed because I&amp;rsquo;m reading too much or I&amp;rsquo;m reading too much because I&amp;rsquo;m feeling depressed.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of books as an escape. That sounds a little too negative but I enjoy experiencing a story that I would probably never experience myself. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve gravitated to historical fiction because it&amp;rsquo;s just so different and unknown territory.</description>

 What is your favorite Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day read? Submitted by Kristin @ Lukten av Trykksverte
 Is it okay for me to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t have any&amp;#8230;? I don&amp;rsquo;t really read anything specifically for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day. I also don&amp;rsquo;t recall any Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day themed books.</description>

      <description>In an attempt to do more things in my free time, I decided to join a gym. My original plan was to go to my university gym however since I am on co-op, I no longer have the discounted membership included in my tuition. Instead, I opted for my local Fit4Less. It is an extremely more convenient location, significantly cheaper, and a good &amp;ldquo;introductory&amp;rdquo; gym for those who are just starting out.</description>

      <description>I decided to post a work in progress. My SO picked this week&amp;rsquo;s picture and it was of a very pretty warrior girl. I started it and I really like how the face turned out. I quickly sketched out the rest of the body and I am already pretty proud of it. Compared to the original, my version looks a little less feminine. I just can&amp;rsquo;t draw lips right from the side.</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling pretty down in the dumps. Ever since I started working, I realized that I have a lot of free time that I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with. I even started to (I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;m saying this) miss having homework. Okay, I actually have a lot of projects that I want to get working on but I also want to be a little more social.</description>

      <description>I chose last week&amp;rsquo;s picture this time. I thought the picture of the duck statues wearing the kitty hats from the Women&amp;rsquo;s March was pretty cute and easy to do as well. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that easy, unfortunately. I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish the sidewalk. Didn&amp;rsquo;t want to draw all those stones. My SO didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to get very far with it either unfortunately. But it was fun to draw!</description>

      <description>Recently, the Prime Minister stopped by our city to hold a quick Q &amp;amp; A with the general public. He spoke at my university and as such, university students had the first chance to get early admission to the event. I had left work a little bit early to get to the university. I grabbed a Carl&amp;rsquo;s Jr burger (which greatly upset my stomach) and ate in the Computer Science club room watching some people play fighting games and Magic.</description>

      <description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s theme was fantasy. The original picture was a lot more ethereal and pretty. I had to redraw this one because I messed up the background. The background was definitely the hardest part because the original picture relied heavily on colour.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of weeks since 2017 has started. I started off the new year with some tweaks to my bullet journal. 2016 wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best year for using my bullet journal. I used it a lot when I was in school but not so much when I was working. I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to be more productive outside of work this year though! In light of my new goal, I decided it was best to revamp my bullet journal.</description>

      <description>One morning after we woke up, my SO wiped the bed and exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s so much of your hair!&amp;rdquo; We both laughed it off but I felt a sense of dread. I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to hair loss. For years now I&amp;rsquo;ve notice more hair in the shower, on my pillow, on the floor, on my laptop, etc. When I go to my doctor every year, he reassures me it&amp;rsquo;s normal and gets me to do bloodwork that always comes back clean.</description>

Another disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not good at writing reviews but I do like expressing my opinions. This is in no way a professional review but rather how I personally feel about this album.
I know Marina and the Diamonds&amp;rsquo; album Electra Heart is one of her personally least favourite works but I like it a lot. Many people think Electra Heart represents an alter-ego but it&amp;rsquo;s rather a personality that Marina holds in disdain.</description>

      <description>Spoilers, beware.
I am not a huge Star Wars fan. I watched the first trilogy very quickly, bits and pieces of the second trilogy, and The Force Awakens. Honestly, most of what I know about Star Wars is from the Lego video games and Family Guy. However, my lack of knowledge of the franchise didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from going to the theaters and watching the latest installment.
When I first watched the Rogue One trailer, I was left wanting for a little more.</description>

I actually received multiple books from my mother&amp;rsquo;s friend, many of them classics such as Villette by Charlotte Bronte, Emma by Jane Austen, Frankenstein by Mary Shelly (who is, by the way, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft), etc. I managed to find many books that I enjoyed from her gift.</description>

      <description>The Game
Take turns to ice an object or living being onto a cookie. Everyone guesses what that person iced onto the cookie. There are no winners, just a bunch of people having fun and joking around about their lack of (or possession of) artistic ability.
The Background
Over the holidays I was baking brownies and cookies with my cousins. The brownies had left over frosting so we decided to ice the cookies with cool designs.</description>

      <description>This is very long overdue but I was blog hopping and came across The Daily Prophecy ran by Mel. Her latest post was a quick survey of all the books she read in 2016. At the end of her post, she posed the question:
 What is the best book you read in 2016?
 This is a very tough question for me to answer. I read a couple of very good books this year.</description>

      <description>This week my SO and I decided to draw a bear. Er, rather, we decided to draw two bears! The picture we found was simply just a quick Google search. It was a rather cute picture! I kinda struggled with this one since bears are really fluffy while the previous week&amp;rsquo;s elephant had very simple lines.</description>

 I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make it a habit of reading everyday. Realistically though, I only really read during the work week. Those days I specifically block out times for myself dedicated for reading: on the way to and from work (since I take public transportation).</description>

      <description>Yesterday I went out with my SO for Vietnamese food. There&amp;rsquo;s a decently sized restaurant called Bow River Vietnamese Restaurant that&amp;rsquo;s close by his house. I regret not taking pictures but their deep fried wontons were delicious. It had a good amount of meat and perfect crunchy crust. The sauce they provided it with was good as well.
For myself, I ordered a regular beef noodle soup. In the soup was tripe, brisket, and beef balls in it.</description>

      <description>Fanlistings are basically the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s version of Facebook pages. I own a bunch of them, mostly of songs or video game characters. Honestly, the whole fanlisting thing has been going down in popularity as the years go by. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit sad. Fanlistings come and go a lot. There&amp;rsquo;s a high turnover rate. I try my best to maintain and keep mine up and running.
However, my old domain name expired and I had trouble getting in touch with my registrar to renew it.</description>

      <description>My SO suggested we start a weekly drawing. So we pick a picture of something to draw and at the end of the week we share it. Last week we drew elephants.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my elephant! I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick to pencil drawings. I&amp;rsquo;m not good at drawing by any means and this was pretty easy, honestly. It was fun drawing it though!

Versus what I was trying to draw&amp;#8230; I see clearly what I should have done differently now, haha.</description>

      <description>Today I learned about IGMP, which stands for Internet Group Message Protocol. There are three different ways packets are sent out to other devices. There&amp;rsquo;s unicast, which just sends a packet to one specific device. Then there&amp;rsquo;s broadcast, which sends packets to all the devices that is in the network. Lastly, there&amp;rsquo;s multicast. Multicast sends packets to more than one device but not all the devices.
If a device wants to be part of a multicast group, it sends out an IGMP packet, or more specifically, an IGMP join packet.</description>

I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&amp;rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&amp;rsquo;s network&amp;#8230; Kinda rough.
However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&amp;rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</description>

      <description>Okay, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I learned about this but I did relearn this while talking to my SO about the AI textbook he was reading.
There&amp;rsquo;s a concept called best first search. The basic example is traversing through a tree. Each node that the algorithm visits, it adds the node to an array solely for visited nodes. It keeps another array for nodes it hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet visited. While it traverses through the nodes, it sorts the visited node array so that the best node is at the start of the array.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about my goals but there are just too many that I have for one year and a couple that will go beyond 2017. So I figured a 25 before 25 would be appropriate.

      <description>This year I told myself I would read at least 25 books. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like a lot but when you consider my reading history the past couple of years, that&amp;rsquo;s a big number.
 2015: 7 books + 3 graphic novels = 10 books 2014: 19 books + 20 graphic novels = 39 books 2013: 40 books + 30 graphic novels = 74 books 2012: 18 books  As you can see, not great numbers.</description>

      <description>I recently made a trip to the library. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I managed to grab.
Buried in Books: A Reader&amp;rsquo;s Anthology by Julie Rugg
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly why they&amp;rsquo;re on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me.</description>

      <description>On Goodreads, my &amp;ldquo;want-to-own&amp;rdquo; shelf used to have 127 books in it. Now it has five.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been bit by the konmari bug. I&amp;rsquo;ve konmari&amp;rsquo;d my wardrobe and my books so far. I&amp;rsquo;m still stuck on the books. I decided it would be fitting to prevent my book collection from growing back to it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous size and get rid of anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t spark joy on my book wish list.</description>

      <description>I recently resolved not to take out any library books unless they were on my to read list. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I took out on my latest trip to the library!
Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember why or how this book got onto my to read list but I know that it&amp;rsquo;s been on the list for quite a while. I was glad to see the book sitting on the shelf since I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m extremely fond of Charlotte Brontë. Villette is easily my favourite novel and I hold it very close to my heart. A couple week ago I finally got around to reading Jane Eyre and it did not disappoint. The other members of the Brontë family are not to be overlooked either. I enjoyed Emily&amp;rsquo;s Wuthering Heights and all of Anne&amp;rsquo;s books are in my to read list. So when I stumbled upon The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë by Syrie James in the library, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist picking it up.</description>

As I heard the small popped kernels tumble out of the bag, I felt both relief and disappointment.</description>

I was doing some inserts and deletes and I was wondering why the database wasn&amp;rsquo;t changing. I tried printing out the queries and double checking that they were indeed correct syntax-wise. I traced my program line by line up to the point where queries were being executed. Finally, I turned to Google.

Solution: Edit ~/.lftp/rc so that it contains set ssl:check-hostname no. What this does is pretty self explanatory. If the hostname in the certificate does not match the hostname you&amp;rsquo;re attempting to connect to, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter because it won&amp;rsquo;t check for that in the first place.</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Spotify a lot. I only ever use it when I&amp;rsquo;m at my computer. When I&amp;rsquo;m on the go, I turn to my trusty iPod classic. Since I use the free version of Spotify (now that I have a job, I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I&amp;rsquo;m a broke college student anymore but I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m still cheap), being able to choose what I listen to is a must and Spotify mobile doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that ability.</description>

      <description>My last post was about security by obscurity and I talked a little about trying to implement security techniques into my projects. This is really great timing.
Last week, various online services ran by my university were down. It was really inconvenient not having access to my e-mail but I took it in stride. I figured it was just the servers acting up or malware or something like that. It turns out that my university was dealing with a ransomware attack.</description>

      <description>Last semester I took an introductory course to information security. One of the concepts we touched on was &amp;ldquo;security by obscurity.&amp;rdquo; Basically what that means is if no one is aware of something, they can&amp;rsquo;t possibly break into it. For example, hiding your diary is a form of security by obscurity. Of course, this has it flaws. There is always the possibility that someone could somehow stumble upon your diary by accident.</description>

Day 28: Rest Day Oh my goodness, today is the last day of the fitness calendar! I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I made it! I didn&amp;rsquo;t make this cookie (I haven&amp;rsquo;t made any of the rest day recipes) but like with the rest of the recipes, I would love to try this eventually!</description>

Day 27: Total Body Today is the last day of the beginner&amp;rsquo;s workout calendar, not including the rest day tomorrow! I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make a blog post the day after rest day to talk about how the month went. As for today, today was a lot of sweat and groaning! A lot of cardio today, even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t intensive.</description>

Day 26: Abs Video 1: Train Insane HIIT Workout  Video 2: Muffintop Shredder Workout I can&amp;rsquo;t remember anymore but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve done this video before. This video is really simple, there is just one move: the candlestick. I think I was doing it properly this time because I started to get tired and I could feel burning in my limbs and my core (I can&amp;rsquo;t be as technical as Cassey, what are my obliques?</description>

Day 25: Lower Body Video 1: Far Burning Cardio Warmup I&amp;rsquo;ve done this video so many times that I&amp;rsquo;ve almost memorized everything Cassey said, haha! The moves in this video are easy and fun, as always.
 Video 2: Hips Butt &amp;#8216;n Thighs Super Shaper Workout   Hot Potato: This is a nice and easy move to start off the video.</description>

Day 24: Lower Body I&amp;rsquo;m still behind&amp;hellip; Oh well, I mostly caught up today. I still have one video to do for day 25 but it&amp;rsquo;s day 25 now and I have three hours left to do it! Today was pretty hard but that could be due to the fact I did two days in one.</description>

Day 23: Abs Okay I&amp;rsquo;m pretty behind. It&amp;rsquo;s now past midnight, I should be doing day 25 today. I&amp;rsquo;m waking up early tomorrow so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to skip out on catching up on day 24 until later in the day. Yesterday (two days ago?) I came home late with a huge head ache and immediately fell asleep.</description>

Day 22: Total Body I was so close to not doing today&amp;rsquo;s workout because I came home late from a volunteering gig with a raging head ache. I slept for about four hours and woke up around 10:30. It took me a while to get started with the workout, I didn&amp;rsquo;t start until 11:15 and I finished at 11:55!</description>

Day 21: Rest Day Today was a much needed rest day. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been having the tendency to fall asleep as soon as I get home, which sucks. So I decided to just sleep, haha! I didn&amp;rsquo;t try out the pizza. Maybe one day. Seriously, one day I will try all of her recipes!</description>

Day 19: Total Body I got home today after writing a midterm and I was so tired that I was tempted to just not do the workout today but then I realized tomorrow os rest day and who wants to work out on rest day? Not me. So I decided against it and got off my butt to do it.</description>

Day 19: Abs I loathe ab days. They&amp;rsquo;re really hard and not that fun, haha. But I really do feel the burn the most on these days. I need to work on this&amp;hellip;
Video 1: Fun Indoor Cardio Workout There are A LOT of kicks in this video. I did my workout in the morning today so I had to do some modifications, as always.</description>

Day 18: Lower Body Because I had to make up day 17 today, I broke the two workouts up throughout the day. But near the end of the day, I just did the last two videos all at once. This day&amp;rsquo;s workout is surprisingly not that bad. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble with the moves today which was&amp;hellip; Weird but satisfying.</description>

Day 17: Total Body Okay, this is the first time I have skipped a day and had to make it up. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel too guilty about skipping yesterday because I had spin class, which is two (maybe even three) times as long and 234204398 times harder than these workouts. I enjoy spin class though, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong!</description>

Day 16: Abs Okay, this is the first day that I technically did not do on the right day. I started this one a little after midnight because I was working on an assignment and then I looked at the time&amp;hellip; Whoops, the day went by fast! Today&amp;rsquo;s videos were okay.</description>

Day 15: Total Body My body issues seem to have improved, minus the random headaches. I tried my best to stay active and not give into my pain. I might have to go to the doctor tomorrow though, if it gets any worse. Both videos today contained moves that were not named so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother with going through each move.</description>

Day 14: Rest Day Ummm, what?? It&amp;rsquo;s rest day already?? I do not believe it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been at this for two weeks now! I feel proud of myself, I never thought I would be able to make it this far. I&amp;rsquo;m officially halfway through the calendar! I decided not to do a workout video today because I&amp;rsquo;ve been so tired and lethargic lately and all of my limbs feel sore.</description>

Day 13: Total Body Video 1: 5 Minute Fat Burner &amp;ldquo;Five minutes? Easy peasey.&amp;rdquo; I was so wrong! Cassey wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying when she said it would be tough. This was a hard video, with lots of suffering included (guaranteed).
  Star Jump: These were really hard to do quietly. I definitely started sweating immediately with this move.</description>

Day 11: Lower Body Another day, another week almost finished (I&amp;rsquo;m talking in terms of the weekday week and not the Blogilates week)! I keep mixing up the &amp;ldquo;Wake up and &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; preambles at the start of each day&amp;hellip;. Yesterday I did 30 second planks on each side instead of just 1 minute of planking.</description>

Day 10: Abs The day starts off with two thirty second planks on each side. How I hate planks&amp;hellip; But I did it anyway, even if I cheated for a couple seconds on each. There&amp;rsquo;s only one new video today and I decided that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t list all the moves for the other videos again in the interest of time and because I don&amp;rsquo;t really have anything to say about specific moves.</description>

Day 7: Rest Day Thank goodness for the rest day. Technically there is 30 minutes left of day 7 and I feel like I should be doing something.

Day 6: Total Body &amp;ldquo;Wake up and do 15 crunches.&amp;rdquo; I did four roll ups instead. And I never do these when I wake up, usually it&amp;rsquo;s the last thing I do before bed. Not today though!
Video 1: Cardio Warmup I&amp;rsquo;m really glad Cassey puts some cardio videos because most of her workouts are focusing on toning and my main goal is to burn fat and not really &amp;ldquo;bulk&amp;rdquo; up.</description>

Day 5: Abs Okay I switched up the preambles in the calendar because apparently I can&amp;rsquo;t read. Day three I was supposed to plank for 30 seconds, yesterday I was supposed to do the burpees, and today I was supposed to drink an 8 oz of water. Whoops! So I compensated today by not only drinking the water but also doing the plank.</description>

      <description>Okay, I know that probably isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot compared to other bloggers out there but to me, that&amp;rsquo;s mind blowing. 9 years is around 40% of my life and that percentage will only keep on increasing. Assuming that I continue blogging. As long as I can type, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would stop blogging. Sure, my blogging might be extremely sporadic but it&amp;rsquo;s still blogging to me.
Actually, I was going through my archive and I read a blog post that was from exactly six years and two days ago.</description>

Day 4: Lower Body The little preamble for today in the calendar simply said to drink a glass of 8 oz of water. I have no idea what 8 oz looks like. Or how much any other measurements of liquids look like for that matter. So I just drank a regular glass of water.</description>

Day 3: Total Body Today&amp;rsquo;s workout starts off with 10 burpees. I will admit, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done burpees since junior high school and I totally forgot how to do them. Unlike yesterday with the sit-ups, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do them at all. Like I had no notion of what a burpee was.</description>

      <description>I initially started writing this post in 2012. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through and cleaning out my drafts and decided this one was worthy of continuing and actually publishing.
Comics are usually written off as being childish or something only nerds can enjoy. But, I&amp;rsquo;m not here to argue whether comics are legitimate literature or not. I&amp;rsquo;m here to point out some of my favourite web comics. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where it started but I got bored one day and eventually ended up on a web comics site.</description>

Day 2: Abs Today&amp;rsquo;s workout is split into two videos. Both target your abs however they vary in difficulty. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that spot reduction (focusing on working out a specific part of your body to lose fat in that one specific area) is a myth. It&amp;rsquo;s only when your overall body fat percentage lowers that will you see results and they will be present around your whole body and not in just one area.</description>

My first post of 2016! This year I resolved to get healthier. That is, eat healthier and be more active! I&amp;rsquo;ve been hanging out on the /r/xxfitness: Fitness for Women subreddit a lot lately. Since I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to go to the gym, someone suggested I try Blogilates, ran by Cassey Ho. I browsed the site a bit and decided to try the Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Workout Calendar which lasts for four weeks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to document my life in a journal. There is something awfully romantic about keeping an account of your day to day life. I just read a book, Fairyland by Alysia Abbott, about a woman who grew up with a single gay father in the &amp;lsquo;80s. She reconstructed both her and her father&amp;rsquo;s life through his journals and their letters to each other. I find it so beautiful.</description>

I have a lot of databases that aren&amp;rsquo;t used and databases that are waiting to be used. I still had my old blog database, back from when Brokenphrases was my main blog. So, I decided to to import all those pages and posts here.
Now my blog post archive is pretty much complete.</description>

I’m feeling super down for some reason right now and I can’t really pinpoint what it is. It feels like there’s a dark cloud looming over my head. I tried to make my notes look extra neat, neater than usual, as that usually helps me calm down whenever I do feel like this.</description>

I’m taking a “zero day” from studying but that doesn’t mean you have to stop learning! I decided to work on my blog and switch frameworks from Bootstrap to Foundation, mostly because Boostrap has the potential to get really bloated and I find that Foundation is more intuitive and their documentation is great.</description>

I was pretty nostalgic over the idea of &amp;ldquo;book blogs&amp;rdquo; and my unsuccessful attempt at a book blog still haunts me today. I decided: I shall blog about books. Book reviews will belong in my book database but anything else will go here. So what exactly is a book blog post that isn&amp;rsquo;t a review?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now in my third year of university. That&amp;rsquo;s an extremely scary thought for me, haha. High school seems like it was just yesterday (to be fair, it was only two years ago). Despite this being my third year, this is technically my middle year. I switched majors which added year to my degree. I&amp;rsquo;ve already done two years and after I finish this year, I have two more years to go.</description>

      <description>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.
 I was mailing out letters one day and there&amp;rsquo;s this guy at the mall who works at a knives store. He has a sweet mohawk. I was sitting nearby putting stamps on envelopes and an old lady asked him if she could touch his hair.</description>

      <description>I only have one link today, that&amp;rsquo;s the blog Altair &amp;amp; Vega.
Altair &amp;amp; Vega is an extremely insightful blog that delves deep into the narrative and art of many popular anime and manga titles. They have a group of multiple authors and while their posts aren&amp;rsquo;t regular, when they do show up on my news feed, it&amp;rsquo;s a great treat.
I forget how I originally got to this site. I probably stumbled upon it through the post on the anime Hyouka, &amp;ldquo;And You Don&amp;rsquo;t Doubt Your Own?</description>

 I had a dream where I literally just lived out my entire day, down to sitting in lecture being bored and taking notes.

      <description>I was awakened in the middle of the night by bursts of light penetrating my closed eyelids. As I opened my eyes, I saw what looked like a meteor shower. For a second, it looked beautiful. But as my lids rose up,a light followed it. Up. Why is that light going up? The skyline glowed with golden orbs and light shot out from them. The lights curled and twisted. And instead of end shortly with a boom like a firework or fading with a fizzle like a sparkler, the kept going up into the sky until my head couldn&amp;rsquo;t look any higher.</description>

      <description>In a way, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to read stories about (romantic) love anymore. Too much emphasis is put on love, whether it be on screen, in print, or just in life in general. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m saying that love isn&amp;rsquo;t important, because it is important. How a character approaches love can speak volumes about their personality. But I just don&amp;rsquo;t want it to be the main plot, or even a sub-plot.</description>

      <description>Warning: Suicide content warning.
My philosophy with this blog has always been to approach in a very casual and informal way. I was inspired by a blog to do so, but I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember what site it was exactly (I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to say it was 6birds, but I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure). I try to have this mindset whenever I need to write a blog post. Even so, I don&amp;rsquo;t entirely feel free in writing whatever I want.</description>

I want it to drag out the dark from inside of me and then I want it to tell me that it’s okay and to list all the things that are good about me. I want to read it and never look at life and humanity the same way again.</description>

      <description>Long weird sappy feelings. So much sap and cheese and this sounded better in my head because I kinda read it in a certain way. Man, I just don’t know. Also, for the love of gulay, the end of a line does not mean &amp;ldquo;pause.&amp;rdquo; Punctuation means &amp;ldquo;pause.&amp;rdquo; Yes, you’re supposed to run out of breath (I&amp;rsquo;m kinda slightly asthmatic though, so).

      <description>Okay, for two weeks I told myself that I would watch the Worlds for figure skating but now I have some time to watch some of it. In typical &amp;ldquo;me-fashion&amp;rdquo; these posts are purely for my own enjoyment (that is the philosophy of this blog anyway sp yes, I am extremely vain!). I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT FIGURE SKATING. I just enjoy watching it. Read on if you dare!

      <description>Since I gave up Tumblr for Lent, I realized how much free time I had on my hands without Tumblr. I decided, why not get back into TCGs? And so I did.
TCG stands for &amp;ldquo;Trading Card Game.&amp;rdquo; There are TCGs around the Internet that you can join as long as you yourself have a bit of space on the Internet. The goal of the game is basically to collect all the cards that are available in the game.</description>

      <description>Man, this was the most productive week I&amp;rsquo;ve had since Reading Week! I&amp;rsquo;m super happy with my level of productivity. I got a lot done and I still managed to have a large amount of free time all to myself. On Tuesday, I got to hang out with a friend for two hours and I still got stuff done.
On Thursday, I went on a Kill la Kill marathon. My friends have been bugging me about watching it and since the finale was Thursday night, I spent the entire day catching up on the series.</description>

Buhar Jerreau
These guys are at the top of my list at the moment. They&amp;rsquo;re a hip-hop/rap group of three guys from Kazakhstan. According to translations of their lyrics, I find them to be extremely talented at song writing. I really am in love with the beats of their songs (I don&amp;rsquo;t know rap lingo&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>I grew up on the Internet. At the end of elementary school, I already had my own e-mail, posted on forums, ran my own forums, learned HTML and PHP, created my own websites, went on YouTube daily, etc. I was a little late to the first touch screen smartphones (just got one almost one year ago) but I had my iPod touch for years and that was all I needed. I played games, listened to music, and downloaded apps like crazy.</description>

      <description>Last week was supposed to be busy week but not much happened really, on the productive front anyway. My friend was running in our student election on campus and I swear, I lost weight just by walking around taking down posters after the election was over and walking around with him while he tried to persuade the general public to vote for him. It was a great experience but man, I did not accomplish as much as I wish I did!</description>

 Pizza 73 is no longer a thing. They took it out of our food court on campus to replace it with Tim&amp;rsquo;s. The lack of pizza on campus makes me sad! The Korean place omg. We waited for like three waves of full length lines until the order was ready. Ok. I&amp;rsquo;ve never gotten shushed before, oops.</description>

      <description>The Monday after reading week is always the worst, that is. I told my friend who is from the States that I had reading week and she had no idea what it is. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty much a Canadian/Commonwealth countries thing where we get a couple days off in the middle of the semester. I heard from the grapevine that reading week started because mid-semester is a period when too stressed out students tend to commit suicide.</description>

      <description>Week of February 23, 2014 &amp;#8211; March 1, 2014. I have a tendency of not using my planner when I have a busy week. There are a lot of unfinished tasks (and tasks that were finished but not marked as finished) this week. That should not be the case at all. As soon as there&amp;rsquo;s a lull in my life, that&amp;rsquo;s the time when I whip out my planner. I need to fix that.</description>

      <description>I went out with some friends today. It&amp;rsquo;s funny because every time we go to this ramen place, our local anime convention has an event. Last time it was their mini winter com and this time they were having a trading pin party up at the university.
But yeah we went to eat ramen. It was yummy. And then we bought candy. That was yummy as well.
But my friends also gave me presents which was really weird wow.</description>

      <description>My second week in my shiny new Filofax! I just realized my major design flaw with my inserts: did not label the times for the weekly part of the inserts. It&amp;rsquo;s okay though, I&amp;rsquo;m not so busy that I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to scribble them in.
A note about how I write stuff down:
Half-filled square: Attempted task but did not finish.
Striked out: Task no longer needs to be done.</description>

      <description>My exams ended relatively early last semester. That meant more time for a break! I didn&amp;rsquo;t do terribly a lot over through break though. Definitely was not as productive as I would have liked to be.
Finished watching and reading Shingeki no Kyojin
Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime. The Internet has been basically exploding over it (my part of the Internet anyway). My friends in real life also freak out over it and so much so that I just had to see what they were on about.</description>

      <title>Tagalog and Translated English Lyrics: “Panginoon” by Yeng Constantino</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: I&amp;rsquo;m not fluent in Tagalog but I am Filipino. English is my first language. This translation is improvised in some parts and relied heavily on Google Translate and my (very limited) existing knowledge of the language.
I love Yeng Constantino (Filipino singer). I put this song at the very front of my Filofax to remind me of two things: to be proud of being Filipino and to keep my mind focused on God.</description>

      <description>I just moved into my shiny new Filofax: a personal sized Woodlands named Ainsley. I spent the day before Christmas Eve and Christmas Eve printing out my custom inserts. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% happy with them. Good thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t print out the whole year and only printed this a semester worth of them. So this is my first week using them! Not a lot happened (besides from parties and the like) so there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot written in there.</description>

      <description>Write a blog post every week
Writing a blog post every day is pretty much impossible for me. However, I still want to post regularly. Posting weekly sounds pretty doable for me. There are 168 hours in a week. If I can&amp;rsquo;t fit in at least one blog post in there, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to rethink my current time management system.
Spend less than 30 minutes on YouTube everyday</description>

      <description>And all though the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a certain university student who should be cramming.
Today was everything but studying. I had the intentions of doing so. I even planned out my day! Then things happened. Those things consist of: music and Ray. I spent most of my day hanging out on Last.fm. Then I went to make a quick tweet about how much I hate recursion, for when I actually decided to crack open my textbook for two seconds.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m done all the finals that I&amp;rsquo;m mostly concerned about. Ok, I&amp;rsquo;m also concerned about CPSC 231 but not as much as I was about the other two. The main reason why I&amp;rsquo;m concerned about it? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to let senpai down. Lame, I know. Super lame. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to look like an idiot in front of him! It&amp;rsquo;s a super easy course and if I screw it up, it&amp;rsquo;s super embarrassing!</description>

      <description>This semester went by really quickly. I never once thought, &amp;ldquo;wow I want this semester to be over.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m not joking, really! I really enjoyed it. Then again, it could be due to the fact that I only took three courses this semester: introduction to Python, Russian literature in translation, and linear algebra. They were all pretty fair courses. I already had some programming experience (once you are exposed one programming language, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to read other languages), my Russian professor was quite easy, and I knew most of the content in linear algebra.</description>

      <description> I&amp;rsquo;m lazy.  It&amp;rsquo;s expensive. Out of the three times I&amp;rsquo;ve worn makeup in my life, I felt more self conscious with makeup than without. I feel like a clown. It physically feels weird on my face. If y&amp;rsquo;all don&amp;rsquo;t love me without the makeup but love me with it, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d want to wear it in the first place.   </description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t miss people much. Usually when I&amp;rsquo;m away from people, I feel relieved. Relaxed. At peace. Almost happy.
However, when things go bad, there&amp;rsquo;s one person I long for.
Then I realize I can&amp;rsquo;t text him. I can&amp;rsquo;t pull up Facebook and chat with him.
What I&amp;rsquo;m feeling is selfish. So selfish.
I wish he was here so he could help me and I could talk to him about everything.</description>

      <description>Yesterday1 I chatted a bit with my senpai. He was so adorable. :( Now I&amp;rsquo;m sure he does not have feelings for me which is both a relief and a disappointment at the same time. Relief because lol that could get too complicated and a disappointment because he&amp;rsquo;s so cute. D:
However, today I did talk to him. I asked him how his weekend was. Apparently it was bad. He spent the whole weekend writing an eleven page paper about network systems and stuff.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday I went out with my friends to go eat lunch. I wish I took pictures but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize my outing could be a potential blog post until yesterday, when I was writing yesterday&amp;rsquo;s blog post. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t make a habit of taking pictures of my food either. People who do that to post them on Twitter and Instagram annoy me. Sorry to everyone I just offended. I just want to eat your food okay.</description>

      <description>My heart hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone doki doki in a while. The last time I can remember is when I was in my freshman year of high school when I was crushing on my first boyfriend1. This was, of course, before last Friday.
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I have my first class with three of my friends. We all have a break after the class so we eat together. Last Friday, we decided to eat in the ICT building.</description>

      <description>AJ reminds me of Kemal. As much as I&amp;rsquo;d hate to say it, that&amp;rsquo;s the number one reason why I find AJ so attractive. He&amp;rsquo;s like the Korean version of Kemal. Also, I&amp;rsquo;d rather fangirl over AJ than be madly crushing on a guy who probably thinks I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot and who I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in almost a year.
However, I saw Kemal on campus a while ago and I realized how much they don&amp;rsquo;t really look like each other.</description>

      <description>Okay I admittedly watch too many videos on YouTube when I should be doing school things but I really like looking for videos of U-KISS. I find it to be so embarrassing that I am a fan. I have to watch metal1 music videos afterwards to regain my manliness get rid of that sickly sweet aftertaste in my mouth that I get when I look, hear, or even think about at U-KISS.</description>

      <description>The sun cleared up his eyes and I was instantly lost.
Even when his head turned towards mine
I could not and would not tear mine away from his.
That colour!
I had never experienced it before.
Warm and clear.
I could see forever in his eyes.
I could feel his disappointment
when he looked into mine: an endless dirt pit.
But he smiled at me then, a sweet crooked grin</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what to write about in my blog right now. At first I was like &amp;ldquo;post everyday!&amp;rdquo; but when I got to it, I drew a blank. Not to mention, the 500 words requirement overwhelms me. What can I write about for 500 words??That&amp;rsquo;s why I already missed more than four days of posting. A &amp;ldquo;blog post idea&amp;rdquo; list would be very hand right now. I gotta start writing down said ideas.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a victim of the 140 characters. Okay, sometimes I like to say things that are more than 140 characters but you know what I mean, yeah? Tumblr (not Twitter) has conditioned me to want to share my thoughts every time they pop into my head. Fortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have Tumblr anymore. Unfortunately, I do have a Twitter. Fortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use my Twitter1 too much because I have only six followers who probably don&amp;rsquo;t care about me at all.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m just really frustrated because this reading week has not be as busy as I would have liked it to be. I ended up watching an embarrassing amount of YouTube videos. I will try to list them all in somewhat order.

      <description>I missed yesterday as well. I&amp;rsquo;m just not very good at this! But I am determined not to miss today. Today I read on Zen Habits that you should never miss doing something two days in a row. It&amp;rsquo;s a good philosophy and a great motivation hack for me. By the time two days have passed, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that that task will never be accomplished.
So yes, it&amp;rsquo;s around 11:30pm and it takes me around half an hour to write at least 500 words.</description>

      <description>Even though yesterday technically has a post, I did not post it until today. Therefore, I missed a day. Being the procrastinator that I am, I usually leave these blog posts until around 11:00pm at night, when I&amp;rsquo;m lying in bed. However, last night I was not lying in bed. Instead, I was seated in front of my brother&amp;rsquo;s laptop, trying to finish an essay. My essay was not due today but I ended up staying up until 3:30 in the morning working on it.</description>

      <description>I said before that I&amp;rsquo;m finding it slightly hard to come up with blog topics. Therefore, I am creating a new feature for my blog: Just a Review. It&amp;rsquo;s basically what it seems like: just a review of my day. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a review review but more like a summary. If I rated my days it would be very depressing to look at all the low scores1

It&amp;rsquo;s on a novel and we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to pull out symbols for it and I&amp;rsquo;m just drawing a blank. My prof started connecting some of them and I tried to follow suit but they&amp;rsquo;re too far fetched. I&amp;rsquo;m really frustrated and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to many people that L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is my favourite band. No, not one of my favourite bands, but my favourite band. Previously, my favourite band had been Green Day, from about grade four to junior high school. They were a great band for me at the time but they didn&amp;rsquo;t have a timeless feel to them. After listening to L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel, I quickly dumped them.
When I was in junior high I even wrote an essay about how L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel had impacted my life.</description>

It also makes me feel very warm and fuzzy inside. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to a song that makes me that gushy. I just can&amp;rsquo;t get over the funky discos vibe.

      <description>Two posts in a row about Rooster Teeth. No regrets. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hanging around the Rooster Teeth website1 and just browsing around.
Now, Rooster Teeth has this original animated series called RWBY. Long story short, it&amp;rsquo;s about a group of exceptional warrior youths training to fight against creatures and terrorist groups. Cool, I know. One of the major strengths of the series is it&amp;rsquo;s soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. The producer of the series has stated that music is a big inspiration for his work and it totally shows.</description>

      <description>November is NaNoWriMo1. I know I will never be able to participate in NaNoWriMo. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to do BloWriMo: Blog Writing Month (which was technically last month, oops). Really lame, I know, but writing everyday is doable but at the same time, challenging. I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for at least 500 words everyday. Yesterday I only did around 440 words but that&amp;rsquo;s because I did not know that I was doing this.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like starting a new website on the first day of a month, halfway through the semester, and with my very first responsive design.
I&amp;rsquo;m excited that I&amp;rsquo;m (silently) opening this website but I also have this nagging feeling at the back of my mind. I need to close a few other chapters in my online life. I have two domains that I will be letting go. One is my current blog and the other was a failed project blog of mine.</description>

      <description>I am almost done my first month of my second year at university! It&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting year leading up to now. I got into university, turned 18, hated engineering with a passion, sucked at engineering with a passion, went to the Philippines, switched majors (in a transition major right now until I can switch into computer science please don&amp;rsquo;t ask me what it is), got a job as a cashier at Walmart over the summer (don&amp;rsquo;t ask me about that either please), got my courses for this semester dropped, went to fix my schedule, found out it wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually fixed and didn&amp;rsquo;t find out until a few days into the first week, and went to go fix it yet again.</description>

      <description>These days, most people are going paperless. With things like &amp;ldquo;the cloud&amp;rdquo; and thousands of web and mobile apps that can do almost anything you want, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard. However, I&amp;rsquo;m going the opposite way. I&amp;rsquo;m going back to paper.
Why on earth would I possibly want to do this? Easy. Smartphones, while useful, also carry a lot of temptations. Sure, you can have 10 note-taking, productivity, schedule apps but you also have an Internet browser, a music player, and quite possibly, a nice library of games.</description>

      <description>So I started this post with me sitting in my office with Wheat Thins in hand, waiting for the Microsoft Press Conference to start via Twitch. The sound was clear, virtually no lag (unless I decided to open a gazillion tabs), and pretty good quality for just 360p. I never realized how huge E3 is. The venue for the Microsoft Press Conference is flipping huge. Seeing the crowd and the green glow absolutely sets the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>While I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a huge gamer, I game enough to be excited about E3 that&amp;rsquo;s starting tomorrow. There is a ton of stuff that are coming out that will hopefully be super crazy due to the next gen consoles that are coming this year. So, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping my eyes glued to the screen on over the next few days.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the Philippines for about five days now. We decided to take a family trip, because it&amp;rsquo;s been way too long since we&amp;rsquo;ve been here. It&amp;rsquo;s been good for the most part. Except it&amp;rsquo;s been an endless cycle of sleep, eat, sleep, eat, sleep with the rare outing. I thought I was going to lose weight here but I&amp;rsquo;m actually gaining, haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to see my Tumblr-ized version of the first two days of my trip (because I&amp;rsquo;m lazy and the heat makes me even lazier), here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Goodbye Pure-Orenji Pure-Orenji.info expired. It was a good three year run. I&amp;rsquo;m sad to see it go but at the same time, it would have happened eventually, so why draw out the process? I guess I&amp;rsquo;m mostly sad over the fact that it was my first domain. I wanted to keep it forever but I grew out of it pretty quick. Hopefully the domains I have now will last me as long, or even longer!</description>

      <description>I let Pure-Orenji.info go because of money issues. This is not the case here. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone (except for maybe one or two people) followed Pure Orenji back when it was a blog. During that time I was going through a weird relationship thing. Also around that time I bought Brokenphrases.info. The name &amp;ldquo;Brokenphrases&amp;rdquo; was highly inspired by my (lack of) social skills and as much as I don&amp;rsquo;t like to admit it, a poem written by the other person in said relationship.</description>

      <description>Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that Room 304 is now officially a book log/archive with minimal blog posts. This calls for a redesign that will emphasize the fact. Why the change? It was always my intention to have Room 304 solely as a book log. But as I heard about book blogging, I decided I would give it a chance. It overshadowed the logging aspect of the site, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I wanted to update the site anymore.</description>

      <description>I went to the library last Saturday! Quite fitting because it is reading week at university. I&amp;rsquo;m probably the only one who takes the &amp;ldquo;reading&amp;rdquo; in reading week seriously&amp;hellip; Anyway, here is my library haul this week in order of the books I remember first:
 French Milk by Lucy Knisley
I&amp;rsquo;m always a sucker for personal memoir-like graphic novels. The cover is just too charming to not want to read it!</description>

      <description>I quit Tumblr for Lent. It&amp;rsquo;s only been a couple of days, and I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated so many Tumblr blog posts in my mind and it&amp;rsquo;s kinda driving me crazy. So crazy to the point where a Tumblr and serious blog crossover is inevitable. Tumblr posts are mostly Twitter-like in nature, except ten times the sarcasm, ten times the ironic usage of poor grammar and spelling, and ten times that length.</description>

This week is going to be tough. I have two midterms on subjects that I have absolutely no idea on what&amp;rsquo;s going on. I didn&amp;rsquo;t study as much as I wanted to on the weekend.</description>

      <description>I just woke up from a dream and I have to write about it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s some kind of omen or just a representation of the current state of my mind, but either way, it spooked me pretty badly.
So I was at the train station, going up the stairs to reach the far end of the platform. The stations have walls that are on the sides of the tracks and they join together above the platform to make a ceiling.</description>

      <description>When I let my friends know that I want to be a librarian after I exhaust my career as a software engineer, one of them laughed at me and said, &amp;ldquo;A librarian with an engineering degree? Are you doing to make houses out of books?&amp;rdquo; I just smiled and responded with a witty comment but inside I wondered, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with that?&amp;rdquo;
While surfing the web, I stumbled upon Graeme Ing, a YA author and a former game developer.</description>

      <description>I love WordPress. It&amp;rsquo;s the best content management system for me and extremely flexible. Anything is possible in WordPress. However, lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing a lack in the number of blogs from undergrads and grads alike. I searched high and low on WordpPess, Blogger, etc. Then I remembered: Tumblr. Not surprisingly, the student blogging community is thriving on Tumblr. 
Tumblr is less of a blogging platform, but more of a social media website.</description>

      <description>I have a hard time reading textbooks. I can&amp;rsquo;t read blocks of text. Yes, regular old books are blocks of text but textbooks aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be read the same way regular books are; they&amp;rsquo;re meant to be skimmed. Even so, I still have trouble. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s only the university level textbooks that are causing me trouble. but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they should be any less readable.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; Is getting an adult library card. I&amp;rsquo;m not even joking. I detested the teen library card. It was too &amp;ldquo;hip&amp;rdquo; for me. So I rather like my simplistic and pretty white adult library card. The bad thing is that I have to memorize a new card number. Although the number for my new card has bits and pieces of my address and home phone number so I reckon it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Catholic, I&amp;rsquo;m always working towards understanding my faith, living my faith, properly representing my faith, and lately: being in harmony with those who do not share my faith. A couple of years ago, I was an ignorant little brat, believing myself better than others who didn&amp;rsquo;t actually identify as Catholic despite going to a Catholic school. That mentality quickly faded away once high school began but that didn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I became &amp;ldquo;any less Catholic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried my best to keep a delicate balance between my more secular values and my, well, not so secular values. It&amp;rsquo;s hard. I still try to do this today. More often than not, my secular values seem to dominate over everything else but I still have this longing to grow in my faith and fully live it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on this semester, the campus bookstore was having a hallway sale. It was my break time, I had nothing better to do and the prices seemed cheap enough, so I went ahead and browsed for around half an hour. There were a couple of books that intrigued me but there was one book that kept me coming back to it. &amp;ldquo;Through the Narrow Gate: Life In and Out of the Convent&amp;rdquo; by Karen Armstrong.&lt;/p&gt;

Usually most people do these resolution posts on the first day of the year, but I do mine second! No, I was busy with the opening of my new blog, go check it out. On with the post!
1. Post more I hate how this has to be a resolution, but yes, I want to post more.</description>

      <description>They say that one of the easiest ways to lose weight is to keep track of what you&amp;rsquo;re eating. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to apply this to my own life in order to lose some weight. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the physical kind of weight but the dead weight that everyone carries around and hinders them in some way. This blog, The Librarian Code, will help me to lose some of that dead weight.</description>

Whew, I finally made it through my very first semester in university. I must say, it was quite a ride. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got through it. Finals are behind me and now I can just relax. Even though I do want to take this time to chill out and slow down the pace, I also want to be productive.</description>

      <description>Two blog posts in a week?? Is this even possible? I&amp;rsquo;m probably dreaming but it&amp;rsquo;s happening. For real.
Whenever I first get on the computer, I find myself starting out pretty darn focused. I open up Blackboard, see what&amp;rsquo;s new, check my falling grades, cry, start on my assignments, etc. Then suddenly it&amp;rsquo;s 1 in the morning (I&amp;rsquo;m exaggerating, the latest I&amp;rsquo;ve started homework was like 10pm&amp;hellip; Still pretty bad though).</description>

But finals start up in two weeks. Huh. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve made a list of things I need to, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really seem like that much but considering my procrastination habits, it is quite a lot. Weekends are for relaxing, not for drowning myself in tears.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been really unmotivated lately. I should be busy with school, but I really am not. Little things keep on discouraging me and causes me to lose sight of the end goal. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with me. I keep telling myself, &amp;ldquo;This is your future at stake! Do you really want to be working 2 or 3 part time jobs?&amp;rdquo; But even so, it does nothing. I&amp;rsquo;m at the point where I seriously think, even for a second, to hell with society.</description>

      <description>These past two months or so have been great for new music. G-Dragon&amp;rsquo;s comeback and news of Coheed and Cambria&amp;rsquo;s new album. So many good things are happening! Lately, there has been three songs that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing over and over again.

A gif made by vitadolce-moderato.   The first one worth mentioning is G-Dragon&amp;rsquo;s new ballad, That XX. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, G-Dragon is a South Korean artist part of the boy group BIG BANG.</description>

      <description>Today was my first day of orientation week! While it was fun, I found that it was lacking a bit somehow. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to see how it&amp;rsquo;ll pan out for the rest of the week. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll be better than today.
It was hectic. I left the house at 7:24 got on the train around 7:40 and got there around 8:20. I was early but apparently too early.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow I start university. Thank goodness for Labour day. I&amp;rsquo;ve never really understood what Labour day is. All I know is that it delays school by one more day and that&amp;rsquo;s all I need to know to be thankful for it. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not at all that excited to be honest. Technically, classes don&amp;rsquo;t start until next week so that&amp;rsquo;s delayed even further.
This week is all orientation. Basically, just having fun and getting to know the campus and mingling with other potential classmates.</description>

      <description>These summer months has been filled with e-mails from my university and just me chatting on the Internet. As September is coming closer everyday, I&amp;rsquo;m getting pretty excited, nervous, and really bummed out. This morning, I received an e-mail listing all of the things I should get done before school starts. Most of them are finished, but there are three major things that I can&amp;rsquo;t actually do just yet.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally been officially accepted into the engineering program at my local university!! I&amp;rsquo;m super crazy excited for university. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start a new clean slate. New school supplies (I admit, I enjoy this part the most), new subjects, new campus, new professors, new schedule, new everything. Speaking of schedules, I&amp;rsquo;ve had my schedule done since May but I was hesitant to post it, seeing as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t 100% sure I was going to be accepted.</description>

      <description>Currently I&amp;rsquo;m writing to you from my shiny new WordPress app on my iPod! I&amp;rsquo;m seriously grateful for the WordPress app. I do 90% of my blogging on my iPod anyway. The only mobile thing about the admin section of WordPress is the login page. Typing long things in Safari is a pain as well. It crashes way too often in Safari. Plus, this app is just distraction free. When you&amp;rsquo;re typing, it&amp;rsquo;s just that: you typing.</description>

      <description>A couple days ago, the Diru fandom on Tumblr was freaking out. I checked the DIR EN GREY tag just to be in the loop. Lo and behold, I see screenshots of this. I immediately went to the official website and there it was. The background was slowly fading in and out with different pictures and the timer slowly ticked away.
First, I freaked out. I went on Twitter, saw @DEG_CANADA&amp;rsquo;s tweet about the countdown and key smashed like there was no tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Yes, after a couple of months, I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat back! And with a new layout as well. I rather like this one more than the previous one. They were both still extremely simple, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a talented designer. I just like writing a lot (I think). With Brokenphrases, I wanted the layouts to be similar to each other. As in, using certain elements (in this case, the logo and the broken two-coloured circle) but with a different structure.</description>

 My Last.FM stats as of July 2012. I use Last.FM a lot, without my knowledge basically. Whenever I open up iTunes, Last.FM secretly scrobbles my music as I listen. Also, whenever I plug my iPod in, I get a dialog box that asks if I want to scrobble everything.</description>

 Okay, I love Hyde. I always have. There&amp;rsquo;s something about him that I just can&amp;rsquo;t ignore. However, I just wish I could bring back the Roentgen era. Variety is good and experimenting is all well and nice but&amp;hellip; Roentgen. I miss you.

 What a coincidence, the song just came up on my iPod. Anyway, a couple days ago I finally decided that I would watch BIGBANG&amp;rsquo;s new music video, MONSTER. I must admit, lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to more and more K-pop these days. I&amp;rsquo;m just craving more new DIR EN GREY, however they are not inhuman and can&amp;rsquo;t churn out albums out of their asses every day of the year.</description>

      <description>I meant to post last on the 15th but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I should blog. It just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right to do so. Even now, I&amp;rsquo;m not so comfortable posting this but I just need to get it out, which is why it&amp;rsquo;s private. Only three people have the password to my private posts so I guess it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad.
On the 15th I received a text from a friend asking about our mutual friend, T.</description>

      <description>Lent is over. I haven&amp;rsquo;t visited Room 304 or Goodreads in over 40 days. Geez, I have a lot of catching up to do. I did read over those 40 days but definitely not a lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve been swamped with school work and going to sleep at midnight every night doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave much time for reading.
So, I&amp;rsquo;ve resorted to audiobooks. Yeah, yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;lazy way of reading&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving some sort of world that I can delve into and just absorb.</description>

      <description>Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was&amp;hellip; Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &amp;ldquo;play all&amp;rdquo; function so that was interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case at all.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow marks the beginning of Lent. Last year I gave up Tumblr for Lent. This year I&amp;rsquo;m giving up using the Internet (minus school things). So for the next 40 days I won&amp;rsquo;t be posting, commenting, reading, e-mailing, Twittering, Facebooking or anything that has to do with the Internet. My poor Neopets are going to starve to almost death (that&amp;rsquo;s the the first thought that came to my mind, how sad).</description>

      <description>Today, my high school hosted a blood donation centre. I wanted to donate blood because, well, it&amp;rsquo;s for a good cause, right? I drank tons of water the day of and the day before so in my morning classes I was going to the washroom a whole lot. So, I went to donate blood during lunch time. I filled out a form, got a drop of blood tested for my iron level, answered some questions (sexual history, travelling, and any other things that could influence whether or not my blood is good to donate or not).</description>

One of my the girls in my section told me that there was band practice the morning of the first day of semester. I went to school at seven and&amp;hellip; No band practice.</description>

Right after I finished my chemistry diploma exam on Thursday, my dad drove me to the library. I felt at home, how sad, haha. Usually I go upstairs to the teen section, but oh ho, not this time! I went straight to the adult comics section. I&amp;rsquo;m quite the rebel, I know.</description>

      <description>Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&amp;rsquo;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong.</description>

Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&amp;rsquo;t study at all and now I&amp;rsquo;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog.

I kinda don&amp;rsquo;t feel any different (no one ever does, am I right?), not to mention that 17 is a weird number. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s odd. But 21 and 23 aren&amp;rsquo;t that weird of numbers either. I guess 17 is weird because it&amp;rsquo;s that age that&amp;rsquo;s in between.</description>

Thankfully it was cut short because the band teachers had to go carol with the other teachers at the front of the school. They actually sounded pretty good. I was expecting horrible off key belting and such but no.</description>

Last year around this time, I set a goal for myself: read 100 books before 2011 ends. I&amp;rsquo;m an avid manga reader and I can finish one volume of manga in an hour so a week into the challenge I found that I was already a quarter of the way through the challenge (keep in mind this was during winter break, haha).</description>

      <description>This morning was a great morning! Most band practices aren&amp;rsquo;t that exciting but this one was pretty good. We played the opener and the second song of the show. In marching band, the members run around a football field making pretty shapes while playing their instruments. Those 11 minutes of organized chaos is what we call a show. At my highschool we have a marching band. I&amp;rsquo;m in band but I don&amp;rsquo;t march because of money and time issues.</description>

      <description>Yes, it is finally December!
The first day of December was okay. In math I got my last unit test back. 91%! But then I got my quiz back. 64%! My marks have such variety, don&amp;rsquo;t they? I felt like my math teacher was giving me disappointed looks all through class because I did so bad on this quiz. This unit we&amp;rsquo;re doing, permutations and combinations, is really weird for me.</description>

      <description>Last Wednesday, the marching band (with a few concert bandies) hosted a workshop for the junior highs in the Catholic School District. It was mostly a ploy to get junior high kids to join marching band if and/or when they come to our school. Sadly, concert band wasn&amp;rsquo;t emphasized in any way (I&amp;rsquo;m part of concert and apparently I&amp;rsquo;m inferior to marching band kids HAH I beg to differ). It was fun regardless.</description>

      <description>Last week we got our yearbooks from last year. I dislike the fact that they give it out in the new school year since not all of those who graduated can come back and sign the yearbooks of those who were left behind. But I guess it takes a while to get all of the pictures, design each of the pages, send it to the company, physically make it, and then ship it back to us.</description>

      <description>I never finished the DIR EN GREY meme. I’ll finish it sooner or later. I haven’t posted in a while either. Oh no! Well, better late than never.
I rediscovered this podcast I downloaded when I just started listening to Japanese and Korean music. All Rock and No Talk by xxthrowdownxx I think it was. So yeah, I was listening to volume 12 and came across a pleasant gem.

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my weekend in a nutshell: lazy and wonderful. I did almost nothing and I loved it. Too bad this is the last long weekend until Christmas break. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll hold out until then. So, here&amp;rsquo;s a slightly more detailed view of my weekend.
Thursday:
Woke up early for my dentist appointment. My mom still makes me go to a pediatric dentist because I’m not yet an adult, haha. I was told that I have nice teeth yet I have cavities and I need my wisdom teeth pulled out.</description>

      <description>I understand that it is almost Thanksgiving in the States so others have long weekends as well. But our reasons for the long weekend are because of parent teacher interviews tomorrow and Rememberance day the after.
Speaking of Rememberance day, today was the Rememberance celebration at my school. Since I go to a Catholic school, the celebration is held at the church behind the school. It&amp;rsquo;s a short walk across the field and into the parking lot but it was chilly.</description>

My iPod&amp;rsquo;s broken. AHHHHHHHHH! I do most of my surfing, blog commenting, and posting on my iPod because I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to my laptop most days. My parents only give me the laptop when I can whole heartedly prove to them that I have homework to do on the laptop.</description>

      <description>I usually don&amp;rsquo;t post on weekends, even though it&amp;rsquo;s when I have the most free time. Even with free time I&amp;rsquo;m usually wasting it, haha. Although today, I did something somewhat productive, which was retweak the layout! I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if you lot like it, but I do. The fancy @font-face works well, haha. As you can see, I used a font in several place. It&amp;rsquo;s called Asenine. I love this font, and that word.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was Thanksgiving in Canada land. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to post because of our super long but extremely satisfying dinner. Turkey, ham, and pasta for all! Not to mention that there was no school yesterday.
I said I was going to create passwords and give them out but that never really happened. It will happen sometime this week when I get around to it.
Today was rather interesting. Everyone was talking about post post.</description>

      <description>I love the song September by Earth Wind and Fire, so I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself. On the 21st I sang the song throughout the whole day. I was tempted to go and play the song on my flute because I learned it, but I forgot where the music for the song went. Oh well. So, do you guys remember what happened on the 21st night of September?
Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve been contemplating this for a while.</description>

      <description>So I have vowed to write at least something everyday for this school year to document my final year in high school. Some of it will be published, some not. I also know most people don&amp;rsquo;t like &amp;ldquo;this is what I did this whole entire day&amp;rdquo; kind of posts but it is my blog, and well, I&amp;rsquo;ll blog whatever I want. :]
To start things off, today was rather ordinary. I woke up painfully early at six in the morning (well, it&amp;rsquo;s early if you&amp;rsquo;ve been sleeping in until noon for two months) because I heard my mom cooking.</description>

Fave song atm: Blame it On the Girls by Mika
Fave musician(s) atm: SCREW
 Favourite interview.
I don&amp;rsquo;t read interviews except for the ones that happen to appear on my Tumblr dashboard. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a couple interviews on YouTube but most of them were outdated or boring.
The one I remember the most though is Toshiya talking about what Diru means to him. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall the details but it was clearly evident that he loves the band dearly.</description>

 Your favourite Dir en grey lyric and translation.
Oh God. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me this. Brb I&amp;rsquo;ll be hunting through lyric sites forever. Anyway, immediately, 我、闇とて。。。 came in my head. Here is the translation:
_It&amp;rsquo;s easy to stop breathing&amp;hellip;but I just want to feel you just a little more

Fave musician(s) atm: MALICE MIZER
 Your first Dir en grey PV.
JEALOUS. I was so hooked on that PV. All the members were just eerily beautiful (especially Toshiya, I loved his costume) and the beginning sounded like one of the Filipino songs my mom sang on karaoke for parties. Crappy quality was crappy though.</description>

Fave musician(s) atm: Közi
 Your first Dir en grey song.
The Pledge (Acoustic Version). The first day should have made it clear. Although I sound mad, I&amp;rsquo;m really not. A lot of these questions are overlapping. It&amp;rsquo;s just annoying to have to repeat myself.</description>

 Your favourite Dir en grey era.
Hrmm. I&amp;rsquo;d say the current era and the MOAB and UROBOROS era. This era seems very natural to me and the two previous eras just naturally lead up to it. It was inevitable.</description>

      <description>I was browsing through some blogs yesterday and came across a blog dedicated to a cat. The blog, I Am Maru is ridiculously cute. It&amp;rsquo;s about a cat named Maru who lives in Japan. The owner likes to take pictures of Maru and put cute captions underneath it. I really think it&amp;rsquo;s adorable.
I love cats. They&amp;rsquo;re just so fluffy and moody (for some reason, that&amp;rsquo;s what I love about them).</description>

Although I&amp;rsquo;m extremely excited to start shopping for school supplies. That&amp;rsquo;s honestly my favourite part of going back to school. I&amp;rsquo;m in love with stationary. Notebooks and binders are something I go through very quickly&amp;hellip;
I have a confession to make. It looks like I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in a while, but I have.</description>

      <description>Over a week ago I went to the Stampede grounds to see Showbands Live. Showbands Live is an annual marching band competition. Every year there are the regulars (The Stetsons Calgary Showband, The Red Deer Royals, and Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts). Last year I was part of the Ghosts and I wanted to support them and see them compete. This year there were a lot of American bands that were participating.</description>

      <description>I have another week to go! I&amp;rsquo;m just ready for it all to be over. Today was a good day because during my 15 minute break, I met up with one of my friends in the hallway. He and the school marching band been in the US for a while and just came back last night so I had a good talk with him. For a moment, I forgot I had school until the bell rang for the end of the break.</description>

So, yesterday I woke up at 6:30 AM sharp, ate my breakfast, changed, and dashed out the door. Usually the first day of school isn&amp;rsquo;t intimidating but for some reason, the first day of summer school was extremely nerve wrecking.</description>

My family doesn&amp;rsquo;t really do anything special for Canada day except for wearing red all day. Last year I spent Canada day in the States actually because of marching band. We were practicing on a football field and on the large scaffolding where the band directors stood, we hung a huge Canadian flag on it.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s almost kinda weird watching it now. I feel like a kid all over again! Except now, I can recite all the words to this movie.
My favourite lines?

For some reason though, I expected it to be much more&amp;hellip; Epic. A lot of people here on Mibba describe their first concert like it was the best orgasm of life.
But for me, it was kinda awkward and surreal. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that the band was really in front of me.</description>

So I&amp;rsquo;ve been obssessed with Koizora lately. The movie, drama, manga, novel, AND the soundtrack. Oh jeez. No matter what form of media it&amp;rsquo;s in, it never ceases to make bawl my eyes out. Plus, in the drama, Seto Koji is pretty hot. *cough*
Today was pretty good. I went to the mall and caused some shenanigans. I bought a visa gift card and I&amp;rsquo;m going to use it to buy iPod toch apps.</description>

Ah, so many things have happened since my last blog post. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember half of it, haha.
On the 24th of March, instead of having a band practice, we had a concert! We got to wear the tuxedos! I always feel like a man in uniform.</description>

Edward Scissorhands, Corpse Bride, The Nightmare Before Christmas&amp;hellip; Holy cheese he is a genious! And Helena Carter is such a great actress. She did the Red Queen so well! Johnny Depp, pssh. He was a good Hatter though.
After the movie, we went to Zellers! There was some toys on display and Cloud touched one of them and then it started to sing and dance.</description>

Alright, so I was writing this, finished, about to press add news, and then Safari closed on me. FML.
Anyway, on to the blog post. I want to be like a doll. Sit there and look cute and pretty while wearing pretty dresses. The pretty Victorian porcelain dolls, not the disproportionate Barbie dolls. No, this isn&amp;rsquo;t weird at all. Me and Cloud were talking about Mana-sama from Malice Mizer.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s this one VK (visual kei) band, Versailles. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of them, but haven&amp;rsquo;t necessarily listened to them. I found this one PV, Serenade &amp;#8211; Versailles, which is simply amazing.
Jasmine You passed away a couple of months ago. Even though I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to Versailles, I was deeply troubled by this news. Jasmine is so beautiful and an amazing bassist. It struck me for the second time that yes, even famous people die.</description>

      <description>Today was pretty fun!! I found out that I lost 13 pounds, that I fail at trying to bench press, and that I can jump! And a lot of band things happened today.
So today was Marina&amp;rsquo;s (colour guard and clarinet) 16th birthday! And Andrew Lumapas came!! He&amp;rsquo;s for sure my hero. His YouTube vids are EPICALLY AMAZING. So amazing that I have to use all caps. Go check out his YouTube account.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really pumped/hyped up/excited for the Kya! effect. Like no joke. Haha. The layout looks suweeeet. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of adopting/renting a domain&amp;hellip; Kya~!
To focus on my offline life&amp;hellip; I just spent four hours at my friend&amp;rsquo;s house. Yummy chips, walks to fish creek park, picture taking, and girl talks.
I have to make sure my band teachers convince my mom about me going to California for our tour this summer.</description>

      <description>The kya! effect is in progress&amp;hellip; kind of.
Ever since the new year started, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of changing the site name to &amp;ldquo;kya!&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;Ueda ♥ Love&amp;rdquo; can imply that it is just a fansite dedicated to Ueda Tatsuya.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a new layout (hint: J-Rock FTW?) all ready. I&amp;rsquo;m working on the pages. With the &amp;ldquo;kya! effect&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on my fandoms. Like fanlists, tribute pages, etc etc.</description>

Anyway, I keep saying I will do things but my parents want me off the computer more and more. =/ I&amp;rsquo;m currently downloading my homework (a worksheet posted on my school website&amp;hellip;haha).
So what&amp;rsquo;s up with everyone?

      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s watching the Grey Cup next week?
To those who don&amp;rsquo;t know.
Grey Cup: The championship of the CLF (Canadian Football League). The Grey Cup game is the centre of a larger week of festivities put on by the host cities, including concerts, gala events, and autograph sessions. Also an important part of the event in the halftime show which in recent years has included major Canadian and international musical acts.</description>

      <description>Well I should be fixing up my speech. Haha. But I could just wing it. I could talk about Green Day with my eyes closed. Personally, I rather it was that way. I fail at speeches so I need the piece of paper in front of me to read off from!
So my homework of today consists of downloading Green Day songs, looking up lyrics, song meanings, watching interviews, music videos, and crazy random shit that they always seem to be doing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad the burial is coming up. All I can say is &amp;ldquo;FINALLY!&amp;rdquo; I love Michael Jackson. I&amp;rsquo;m still so sad. I love Michael! Did I already say that? Oh. Anyway. Everyone is saying that he&amp;rsquo;s gay, but I refuse to believe it because he is mine and I love him! Just kidding. Michael Jackson fans are crazy&amp;hellip; R.I.P Michael!
Today I went to the Balzack mall that just opened. It&amp;rsquo;s big but not that big.</description>

Calling All Bookworms:
Summer is almost over and I have read about 120 books. Whoot! It may seem impossible but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Very few of the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read stand out in my mind. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bookworm, check out these books!

It&amp;rsquo;s not the Ryo from Maximum The Hormone or Ryo from JE. My friend told me a list of Japanese guys she thought was hot, and I went to find desktop backgrounds for her. Ryo was on the list&amp;hellip; Uwah! My memory is bad.</description>

Anyway my best friend is in the US and I miss her! She&amp;rsquo;s missing out all the fun youth events at church. Like tomorrow is the Corn Maze! Yes, Corn Mazes!</description>

      <description>Yes! Haha. Michal Jackson time! I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty broken up about his death, but I just love looking at pictures of him! And videos&amp;hellip; Yesterday, I even bought a Michael Jackson concert CD (haha&amp;hellip;).
So, I just watched Up! It was really good. Except for my left ear that was blocked, and I forgot to bring glasses/put in my contacts. Ugh, my stupidness! It happens often&amp;hellip;My memory is bad, even though I&amp;rsquo;m still young.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Olivia for pointing out my layout issue! I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice&amp;hellip;it looked fine when I first uploaded it. So I switched to the old one while I work out the kinks. Gah!
Anyway~ I just had a party. Marshmallow roasting, kids running around, drunk dads everywhere, you know the works!
AND I saw him today. The guy I have been liking on and off for three years now. Haha. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen him since Father&amp;rsquo;s Day and I didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything to him back then&amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s call him&amp;hellip; Gunther.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m trying to fix a bug so all the other pages except for the home page stayed the same (also, I&amp;rsquo;m in a haste&amp;hellip;haha).
Welcome a new affilate:
freaking riot lyts.
I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of at least adding her link on all the old pages so sorry if I miss a page (like I said, I&amp;rsquo;m in a haste, haha).</description>

      <description>Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find ways to properly display my avatars and future graphics! I&amp;rsquo;m trying to setup Lightbox, but the thing is that the &amp;ldquo;white space&amp;rdquo; is too little. I put captions underneath and it&amp;rsquo;s all&amp;hellip;um. Weird!
Any ideas? I tried to increase the padding, but it did some weird stuff (the avatar wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the white space&amp;hellip;). Does it make sense? I hope it does&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m working on all those projects below (see last entry) and my fanfic.</description>

I need to make buttons for this site! How could I forget? TT_TT I&amp;rsquo;ll go make some now&amp;hellip; And I hope that next update, I&amp;rsquo;ll have the new layout!</description>

My progress:
-Icons 65&amp;frasl;100
-Layouts 5&amp;frasl;10
-Headers 5&amp;frasl;10
Those are just the things I already started. Oh wow. I am SO fast. Good thing I have a year to do this.
Anyway. The Michael Jackson memorial was so sad. I bawled. Especially during when Paris, Marlon, and Brook Shields said their little speeches.</description>

      <description>Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to rant about Michael Jackson. Here&amp;rsquo;s a journal entry I made a couple days ago at my DeviantArt account.
&amp;ldquo;I have been mourning for days now. No joke. Downloading MJ songs, watching tributes, joining Facebook fan pages, watching lives, reading articles, and whatever.
He&amp;rsquo;s such a beautiful man even with the white make up and the plastic surgery. You see him smile, and you think &amp;ldquo;Awww.&amp;rdquo; Haha.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;m working on it&amp;hellip;
Now back to real life&amp;hellip; Yesterday I went to a party for the end of the year. Okay, it was more like a BBQ but it still counts, right?</description>

&amp;ldquo;Congratulations!
You have been accepted!&amp;rdquo;
And then I screamed&amp;hellip; I Twittered, Facebooked, and forum posted about it. No one really was as estatic as I was, but that was to be expected. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited for what this site can be turned into.</description>

      <description>My skool is posted on a band&amp;rsquo;s website! That&amp;rsquo;s never happened before. In the picture, the first school listed is my school. It was career day today and the day ended with the Absolute Presentation. I remember the presentation form last year. Last year was better but mainly because the band was better (Colin Lingren is amazing). But apparently the band that came to our school was better in terms of success.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;m going through a Japanese band phase. I think it really started with the theme songs for Gundam Seed Destiny, then Naruto, then Inu Yasha, then Bleach, and then Full Metal Alchemist. FMA mostly. If it wasnt for FMA I would have NEVER heard of L&amp;rsquo;Arc~En~Ciel.
L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is my number one fave Japanese band and my number one fave song by them is Link (which is the opening theme song for the FMA the Movie: The Conqueror of Shamballa).</description>

One of my friends is already fourteen! She can get her learner&amp;rsquo;s permit nd she cant get over the fact she&amp;rsquo;s two years older than me. At least I&amp;rsquo;m not like my one friend. HHe doesnt turn thirteen until February.</description>

      <description>Today, my TA went to the church across the street to help out with the food hampers. Our job was to bring all 200 something boxes from the basement to the main floor. Do you know how hard that is? It was definitely a workout for me. I got my friend pat to help me with over half of my boxes and he calls me lazy. There was this freight elevator, and we had to bring carts full of food with it.</description>

      <description>I had a dream, that Gerard Way and Amy Lee were at my church and they fighting over who was a better singer. It was so weird. Then suddenly, Gerard got naked. One second he had clothes, the next he didn&amp;rsquo;t. He just magically got naked and strangely, Amy wasn&amp;rsquo;t bothered with it.
I also had a dream that Billie Joe Armstrong murdered someone and got into jail and went all crazy up in the mind.</description>

      <description>Three days ago, I started school, and I found out that we no longer have homerooms. Now we have TA I went to my TA in the band room and found three grade niners there, and I thought I was in the wrong homeroom, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Oh and guess who my teacher advisors are? The principal and the vice principal! This is going to be one great year.
I have three of my friends in my TA and I have to stick with my TA Until I finish junior high&amp;hellip; bleh.</description>

Just on the other coast&amp;hellip; The last time they were on Much on Demand (MOD) was on th 11th of May&amp;hellip; It was a Friday&amp;hellip;.. *sigh* I&amp;rsquo;m very excited.. And Kelly Clarkson was on MOD a few moments ago&amp;hellip; She&amp;rsquo;s funny&amp;hellip;</description>

Much Music just premiered the music video Teenagers by My Chemical Romance like, a minute ago&amp;hellip; It was good video&amp;hellip; Good song, but where&amp;rsquo;s the usual &amp;ldquo;theatrical&amp;rdquo; video??? Whatever, it was still good as always&amp;hellip; Teenagers is my brother&amp;rsquo;s favourite song because, in his words, &amp;ldquo;teenagers really do scare me&amp;hellip; Like you.&amp;rdquo; And then I&amp;rsquo;m like &amp;ldquo;Uh&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not a teenager&amp;hellip; Yet.</description>

      <description>Beauti is a pretty good band. Right now, they&amp;rsquo;re on tour with this thing called Absolute. They travel all across Canada to high schools. Which really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense because I&amp;rsquo;m in junior high. Anyway, they played four songs (actually three, but they played one song while the kids went into the gym). I forget what one song was, but the two songs they played was Forever Love, and Don&amp;rsquo;t Watch Me.</description>

      <description>Hello! I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while. For some reason I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Geek Stink breath a lot. I miss the old GSB, when there were more people there. I still love GSB though!
I have been working on my religion project for the past four days. I&amp;rsquo;m finally finished now. Thank goodness. Who knew that a simple powerpoint about a saint would be so much work? I guess I&amp;rsquo;m too much of a perfectionist.</description>

      <description>My locker&amp;rsquo;s right next to the band room, and grade niners are constantly standing around my locker. The grade niners like to listen to this guy play the drums every single lunch period. I was opening my locker, and the guy who plays the drums was looking at my locker. They saw my Billie Joe Armstrong poster (which unfortunately does not exist anymore because one of my friends tore it up).</description>
