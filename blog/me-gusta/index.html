      <h1>Me Gusta</h1>
      
      <p>Here&rsquo;s my weekend in a nutshell: lazy and wonderful. I did almost nothing and I loved it. Too bad this is the last long weekend until Christmas break. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll hold out until then. So, here&rsquo;s a slightly more detailed view of my weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday:</strong></p>

<p>Woke up early for my dentist appointment. My mom still makes me go to a pediatric dentist because I’m not yet an adult, haha. I was told that I have nice teeth yet I have cavities and I need my wisdom teeth pulled out. Ouch. Also, the assistant dentist asked if I was in grade eleven and I dumbly said yes, thinking I was still in grade eleven.</p>

<p><strong>Friday:</strong></p>

<p>Got my friend to change my password for Tumblr so that I don’t procrastinate anymore. I still procrastinate.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday:</strong></p>

<p>Told myself I would finish my homework. I finished my fanlisting collective, a fanlisting, and worked on my book log. Productive procrastination, yay!</p>

<p><strong>Sunday:</strong></p>

<p>Went to church, joined a Tumblr guild on Neopets, talked to the people there for a good two hours, and got someone to sell me a Christmas paint brush for half price. I proceeded to paint Eluxus (my kougra) Christmas. One dreamie pet down, two to go! Also, I favourited a gazillion songs on YouTube. Then I finished my homework. Okay, I didn’t finish it but I have spare first period so I’ll just do it then.</p>

<p>I hope everyone else had a good long weekend as well!</p>
