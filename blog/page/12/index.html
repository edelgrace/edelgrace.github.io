Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever found yourself acting like a favorite character in a novel? If so, which one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all! The only time I find myself acting like anyone other than myself is if I&rsquo;m acting like my friends as a result of months of exposure to their quirks and traits. I rarely spend that much time with a character, even if I&rsquo;m reading a series.</p>

<p>There have been times when I thought to myself, &ldquo;I wish I could act like that character&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wish I could be more like that character&rdquo; but I rarely act on it. If I do, it&rsquo;s usually more of a universal trait rather than a specific trait that makes a character unique. For example, sometimes I wish I was as brave as some characters. But many characters are brave and they are hardly unique for being so. In conclusion, the answer is no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For fifty years, National Book Award winner Ursula K. Le Guin’s stories have shaped the way her readers see the world. Her work gives voice to the voiceless, hope to the outsider, and speaks truth to power. Le Guin’s writing is witty, wise, both sly and forthright; she is a master craftswoman.</p>

<p>This two-volume selection of almost forty stories taken from her eleven collections was made by Le Guin herself, as was the organizing principle of splitting the stories into the nominally realistic and fantastic.</p>

<p>Where on Earth focuses on Le Guin’s interest in realism and magic realism and includes eighteen of Le Guin’s satirical, political, and experimental earthbound stories.</p>

<p>Highlights include World Fantasy and Hugo Award winner “Buffalo Gals, Won’t You Come Out Tonight,” the rarely reprinted satirical short, “The Lost Children,” Jupiter Award winner, “The Diary of the Rose,” and the title story of her Pulitzer Prize finalist collection Unlocking the Air.</p>

<p>Stories in this volume were originally published in venues as varied as Playboy, TriQuarterly, Orbit, Redbook, and The New Yorker.</p>

<p>Companion volume Outer Space Inner Lands includes Le Guin’s best known nonrealistic stories. Both volumes include new introductions by the author.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love Ursula K. Le Guin. I <a href="(http://edelgrace.me/blog/inspiration-from-fictional-worlds)">wrote a post</a> about just how much she sparks my imagination and makes my insides tingle. I really enjoy her science fiction and I haven&rsquo;t read any of her &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; fiction. This is where the books title originates. <em>The Unreal and the Real</em> is a two volume anthology of Le Guin&rsquo;s short stories. The first volume, <em>Where on Earth</em>, is a collection of stories that do not have any science fiction elements in them.</p>

<p>This volume was actually a hit or miss on a couple of the stories. I can barely remember most of them however the ones that stuck out in my mind were: <em>Brothers and Sisters</em>; <em>Buffalo Gals, Won&rsquo;t You Come out Tonight</em>; and <em>Half Past Four</em>.</p>

<h3 id="half-past-four">Half Past Four</h3>

<p>I had already read this short story before. I own the book, <em>Unlock the Air and Other Stories</em>. The first time I read it, I was wholly confused. There were mini stories in this one story and the same characters were in each story. It seemed like their circumstances were different in each of the stories.</p>

<p>The introduction in <em>Where on Earth</em> really put the story in perspective. They were all separate and distinct stories despite having all the same characters. This was inspired from writing exercise Le Guin taught a class of poets: write a story about people with varying positions of authority.</p>

<p>Knowing the whole story now made me appreciate it much more. I don&rsquo;t know which mini-story I preferred the most. I liked how each story kept the main traits of the characters and it seemed to actually add to their personalities. It was interesting knowing how each character would act in different circumstances and relationships with each other.</p>

<p>Essentially there are four characters: Ella, Ann, Todd, and Stephen.</p>

<p>Ella is a woman who is either Ann&rsquo;s mother, step-mother, or sister. Ann is pregnant or a new mother and a sister to Todd or Ella or Stephen&rsquo;s daughter. Todd is Stephen&rsquo;s step-son or Ella&rsquo;s brother or Ella&rsquo;s son. Stephen is Ann&rsquo;s father or Ella&rsquo;s brother or the neighbour. It&rsquo;s all very complicated when I explain it like this but it&rsquo;s actually easy to keep track of.</p>

<h3 id="buffalo-gals-won-t-you-come-out-tonight">Buffalo Gals, Won&rsquo;t You Come Out Tonight</h3>

<p>This story was very different but also very Le Guin at the same time. A child survives a plane crash in the middle of the desert and is adopted by animals. These animals can talk and take the appearances of humans but are still very much animals. I love how Le Guin can capture the characteristics of these animals in a humanized way. For example, Coyote, is a wild and brash character, not unlike a real coyote. The animal society in the desert is also extremely fascinating.</p>

<h3 id="brothers-and-sisters">Brothers and Sisters</h3>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because <em>Brothers and Sisters</em> was the first story that I remember it very well. This is a story of two brothers, one pretty exceptional and the other a dreamer. Of course, in the middle of them is a girl. I was quite pleased with the outcome and while I grew to dislike some of the characters, I couldn&rsquo;t fault them for their personalities.</p>

<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>

<p>I liked this book quite a bit. There were some stories that I didn&rsquo;t particularly care for unfortunately but I enjoyed it nevertheless. I would give this book a solid <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. Le Guin is great with her words and I would recommend it to people who don&rsquo;t expect her science fiction. I think in the end I prefer her fantasy/sci-fi works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Susan Gordon Lydon was coping with a broken arm, her craft took on new significance. While knitting was essential to strengthening her hands, it also provided her with a newfound sense of peace and creativity. Immersed in brilliant colors, textures, and images of beautiful sweaters, Lydon found healing and enlightenment in a way she had never imagined. Capturing this journey of discovery, The Knitting Sutra recounts her remarkable membership in a community of craftswomen around the world, from sweater makers in Scotland to Navajo weavers, and the adventures that her craft led her on.</p>

<p>As she masters new techniques and conquers old obstacles, Lydon’s story conveys how the lessons she learned from knitting, such as stillness and interdependence, later sustained her through a cancer diagnosis and even the incapacitation of her hands. <em>The Knitting Sutra</em> is both a meditation on craft and an affirmation for anyone seeking heartfelt comfort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not actually a knitter. I mean, I knit, but I am in no means an actual knitter. It doesn&rsquo;t stop me from enjoying stories related to knitting.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought this would be a more of a workbook that would help guide you through spiritual knitting. When I deciding whether or not to take this book out of the library, I read a snippet. Nope, it seemed to be largely a memoir. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed but like I said, I enjoy stories related to knitting.</p>

<p>Lydon seems to be a very spiritual person. I didn&rsquo;t expect a knitter would be crossing the country seeking guidance from spiritual leaders. It was a bit out of the ordinary but I quickly grew to wish I had known Hayat and Jimmy and the likes. Lydon seems like a very well traveled and knowing person so I enjoyed following her around in her attempts to make peace with the spiritual.</p>

<p>Of course, the main lesson of the story is mindfulness. The main reason why I felt this book didn&rsquo;t satisfy me was because I didn&rsquo;t necessary learn anything new. While I do like how Lyndon approaches mindfulness, I was still left for wanting more.</p>

<p>What I appreciated the most however was her advice on knowing yourself. Several times throughout the book, Lyndon refers to making sweaters that never really appear like she thought they would. The sleeves would turn out too big or the garment would be slipping off her shoulders. It was best to make your own tweaks to patterns so that whatever you were making was fit for you. And mistakes were okay. Arabic weavers would often put in mistakes into their works because &ldquo;Nothing but Allah is perfect.&rdquo; I thought that was a good metaphor.</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>I give it a <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. This is not a book that I would come back to nor remember in a couple of years. It was well written and I enjoyed the content but it was ultimately lacking.</p>

<p>The difference between the knitting moments and the spiritual moments were too great at points. Some of the links between the two were too weak to justify. However, Lydon did make some good points throughout the book that kept me reading.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice quick read and the fact that it&rsquo;s so short justifies the time spent on it. Don&rsquo;t pass it up if you have the chance but you aren&rsquo;t missing much.</p>

        <p><strong>Warning: Spoilers for both <em>Life is Strange Season 1</em> and *Life is Strange: Before the Storm</strong>*</p>

<p>In <em>Life is Strange Season 1</em>, Racher Amber is a mystery. If you walk around and talk to the locals, everyone (including those with less than stellar personalities) has nothing to say but praises about Rachel. Throughout the game, Rachel is built up to be perfect to everyone you speak to. The artists loved to try to capture her essence, the nerds enjoyed her intellectual prowess, and the popular kids enjoyed partying it up with her. But even to those who knew her, there was an element of mystery surrounding Rachel. She kept up a certain distance from everyone but was still able to draw people in with her personality.</p>

<p>Understandably, this made me excited and a little bit nervous for Rachel&rsquo;s portrayal in the prequel, <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em>. Who was this person who was able to seduce all of Arcadia Bay and put all these diverse personalities under her spell?</p>

<p>Once Rachel made her first appearance in the series, it was a little overwhelming. She stepped into frame and I immediately thought, &ldquo;This is looks like a kid trying to look like a grownup.&rdquo; There stood Rachel Amber, all dolled up in thick eyeliner and a gothic outfit that looks like it should intimidate and be edgy but is a little awkward on her small frame. She was a fifteen year old looking to impress and rebel. Not so different from Chloe who was doing the same thing but Rachel&rsquo;s execution was more loud and dramatic. Rachel definitely had the flair for the dramatic.</p>

<p>In the first episode, Rachel brings Chloe along in her adventure to catch her dad cheating. However, Rachel doesn&rsquo;t tell Chloe this. When Rachel sees what she clearly doesn&rsquo;t want to see, her mood shifts drastically. This was when my red flags started going up. Rachel becomes immediately non-communicative. She then attemps to steal a wine bottle from a couple (wether or not she&rsquo;s successful is up to you). Another red flag. Here is a teenager who is already drowning her sorrows in alcohol and at the expense of stealing.</p>

<p>When they move into the junkyard, Rachel&rsquo;s sour mood continues. She throws insults and blames on Chloe when Chloe tries to decipher what was going on with Rachel. They quickly make up at the end of the day and Rachel confesses that the couple kissing in the park was her dad and a woman who was definitely not her mom. Her reaction is burn a photo of her and her dad in a trash can and knock it over, causing a raging forest fire.</p>

<p>From the start, Rachel Amber is complex and volatile. She is unpredictable and a beautiful liar.</p>

<p>What hurts the most about Rachel is that she is a perfectly flawed teenager. There is nothing more romantically tragic about someone trying to make their mark in the world in the most risky ways possible. Her end is even more tragic.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the end of <em>Before the Storm</em> that I felt a lot sorrow for Rachel. She was extremely firey and full of life. She had big dreams and wishes and regrets. And then everything ended before she could even have the chance to really live.</p>

<p>On one hand, I&rsquo;m a little glad they gave us such a short snippet of Rachel&rsquo;s life. It really hammered down the fact that life can be so brief. So while Rachel&rsquo;s story is tragic, it&rsquo;s not so removed from reality. That&rsquo;s why I really like the <em>Life is Strange</em> series. Despite the obvious embellishments, it&rsquo;s pretty down to earth and the characters make everything worth it. Some people may dismiss it as a game but it&rsquo;s still great medium of storytelling. I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>
