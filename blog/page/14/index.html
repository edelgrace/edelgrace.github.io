</blockquote>

<p>This is a good question. I don&rsquo;t have a preference, really. I think it depends on how well an author can execute their beginning. If an author jumps right into the action but cannot grab me, maybe they&rsquo;re better off with a different technique. If their description of their character is bland and boring, I might put down the book.</p>

<p>But if I really had to choose, I think I might have to go with being slowly introduced to the story and characters. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m the type to prefer lengthy descriptions or flowery explanations but I do like being able to have some time to figure out what I&rsquo;m getting into.</p>

<p>Lately, the books I have read have mostly used this style of introduction. I notice that a lot of the older novels tend to go this route, usually focusing on the nature of the main character&rsquo;s personality. It definitely shapes what you expect from the character. Some might think it ruins the element of surprise but I enjoy it when I have even just a little bit of understanding of what goes through a character&rsquo;s head.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I found myself in downtown with cancelled plans the other day. I didn&rsquo;t have to be home for another two hours so I decided to try a new coffee place. It was around five in the evening. I pulled up Google Maps and searched for coffee.</p>

<p>Scrolling through the list, I found that most of the coffee places closed at 5:00PM or 6:00PM. I needed a place to sit and blog hop for a little bit so that was no good. Even Starbucks closed pretty early!</p>

<p>From the list, I picked a couple of the coffee shops that were still open and just a 15 minute walk away from my current spot. When I went up to them, I discovered that they were actually closed for the day or closed for forever. Great.</p>

<p>In the end, I just went to the mall that had a Tim Hortons that was guaranteed to be open past 7pm. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t the vibe I wanted as it was crowded with strangely energetic construction workers who just ended the day but it did the job. I could sit down, drink some coffee, nibble on a donut, and comment on some blogs.</p>

<p>I wonder why some places close so early? I read somewhere that Calgary has a horrible night life and I just might have to agree. Downtown is honestly the last place I imagined to have places closing up early. In fact, I would have assumed the opposite!</p>

<p>My SO and I actually ran into similar problems during Valentine&rsquo;s Day. We didn&rsquo;t want to go to a restaurant but instead wanted to go do something. There were a couple of galleries we wanted to go to but they all close at 5:30pm. We would never make it there on time.</p>

<p>I know people want to go home to their loved ones at night but what about night owls like myself who want to put off going home but still enjoy a nice and quiet atmosphere? Okay, maybe I&rsquo;m asking for too much.</p>

        </div>

        <p>As you may have noticed, I recently took up learning how to crochet. Since March is National Crochet Month, &nbsp;I decided to take part in some of the activities that are being held at Ravelry.</p>

<p><strong>MCAL (Mystery Crochet Along)</strong></p>

<p>This is an event that reveals the pattern slowly, clue by clue. The only hint is that it&rsquo;s an anigurumi made out of three colours. This will be my first amigurumi so I&rsquo;m quite excited but also anxious that it won&rsquo;t turn out well.</p>

<p><strong>Team Catghan</strong></p>

<p>There is one CAL aimed at making items for donation. I decided to make cat rugs as they seemed to be the easiest of the bunch.</p>

<p><strong>Bag CAL</strong></p>

<p>This CAL is pretty simple, just crochet a bag! Any bag, really. I am not sure what kind of bag I want to make. I did see one pattern that is easy but it&rsquo;s made entirely of single crochets. A little boring but it&rsquo;s doable.</p>

        <p>Since I&rsquo;m just starting out with crocheting, I bought a somewhat cheap crochet set on Amazon. I&rsquo;m hesitant to buy high end luxury tools if I&rsquo;m not even sure I want to continue crocheting. I do think it would be a worthy hobby to take part in!</p>

<p>The case itself is seriously cute. The brand seems to be <em>Merrywindix</em> but I can&rsquo;t quite tell. It&rsquo;s a lot smaller than I expected which is great, that means it&rsquo;s extremely portable.</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-336610788jpeg.jpeg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-336610788jpeg.jpeg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" class="wp-image-252 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Once you open the case, the crochet hooks and a gauge are all laid out neatly and in the middle is a detachable pouch containing smaller items.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-1340625252jpeg.jpeg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-1340625252jpeg.jpeg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" class="wp-image-254 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Here is the open case with the pouch removed, if you so choose.</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-468931543jpeg.jpeg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-468931543jpeg.jpeg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" class="wp-image-255 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Inside the removable pouch there are a couple of useful items such as stitch markers, foldable scissors, a magnifying glass (how cute!), measuring tape, yarn needles, and two contraptions I don&rsquo;t know what they are quite yet.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-379559443jpeg.jpeg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wp-image-379559443jpeg.jpeg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" class="wp-image-256 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>If you need to know any additional information about the case, let me know! I know I&rsquo;m looking forward to using it.</p>

        <p>The fine folks at <a hre="http://www.skacelknitting.com">Skacel Knitting</a> are hosting a series they call &ldquo;<a href="http://www.crochetalongtogether.com/">Crochet Along Together</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;CAT&rdquo; for short. They post videos throughout the month to walk you through the project. A draw is also held after the project is finished.</p>

<p><strong>March CAT</strong></p>

<p>This is their very first installment and is geared towards (but not limited to) beginners to crochet. The project for this months is the <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/easy-as-1-2-3-cowl">Easy As 1-2-3 Cowl</a> which is a three colour cowl.</p>

<p><strong>Supplies</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>3 skeins of HiKoo &reg; Simplicity yarn each different colours</li>
<li>1 4mm corchet hook (size F in addi&reg; or size G in other brands)</li>
<li>1 locking stitch marker</li>
<li>1 darning/tapestry needle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why I&rsquo;m joining</strong></p>

<p>This is perfect timing for me to enter the crochet world. I had been interested in crochet for a couple of months after my SO received a cute crocheted Yoshi as a present and after seeing a couple of people busting out their crochet hooks in lectures. This definitely goes with my &ldquo;find a hobby&rdquo; quest that I have for myself. My SO actually suggested I try knitting but I was a little more drawn to the cute crocheted toys that I so often see. In general, I like how crochet results in something a little more concrete and physical. It seems like a good way to keep my hands busy and give some trinkets to family, friends, and people in need.</p>
