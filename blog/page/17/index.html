<p>I always forget this command. I always try to attempt to go <code>mysql dump</code> instead of <code>mysqldump</code>. Hopefully posting this little blurb will give me an easy reference in the future!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just in time for the 200th Anniversary, Manga Classics: Emma brings Jane Austen&rsquo;s classic tale of youthful folly and romantic exuberance to a modern audience with this beautiful, new manga adaptation. The impulsive match-making of Emma Woodhouse delivers both humor and heartache through the gorgeous artwork of manga-ka Po Tse (Manga Classics: Pride and Prejudice). &#8211; Manga Classics editions feature classic stories, faithfully adapted and illustrated in manga style, and available in both hardcover and softcover editions. Proudly presented by UDON Entertainment and Morpheus Publishing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I enjoyed Jane Austen&rsquo;s <em>Emma</em> a great deal. After reading the novel, I proceeded to watch several movie adaptations. Each movie had a slightly different take on Emma but still stayed true to her character to the very core.</p>

<p>This rendition of Emma is not the greatest. Emma is been a haughty sort of character to me but somehow this adaptation made her seem almost unbearable. Unfortunately, from what I recall of the original novel, many of the lines are word for word so it would be unfair to pin it on the words she says when they are from Austen herself. Maybe the exaggerated body language in this medium portrayed Emma&rsquo;s character very poorly. Even Mrs. Elton seemed to be extremely over the top to put Emma in a better light and Mrs.Elton was already over the top to begin with.</p>

<p>In terms of art, I found it to be perfectly light and airy. Very suiting for a Victorian first-world problems drama. However the style is not in my tastes. I was also disappointed that it didn&rsquo;t seem to be all that historically accurate. Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s little goatee annoyed me but I will admit that I don&rsquo;t know if that was in vogue during that time. I wonder how much research went into the fashion of the times. I&rsquo;m not a fashion historian so my claims might be entirely wrong.</p>

<p>But, it was still a nice little read. It remained very true to the original and what more can an <em>Emma</em> fan ask for?</p>

        <p>This next dishcloth I made was a simple green dishcloth with single crochets. What initially drew me to the pattern was that the texture of the dishcloth was very pretty. I was surprised to know that the variance in texture was simple due to changing which loop you inserted the hook in! While it isn&rsquo;t completely perfect, by the time I finished this I felt a lot more confident in my single crochets.</p>

<p>The yarn I used here was Bernat Handicrafter in Hot Green. I used all of it up after making my previous dish cloth. So around 50 yards were used, I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>

        <p>My SO and I have been playing an MMO called Blade and Soul recently. We were optmistic about it running on my laptop because the requirements didn&rsquo;t seem too intensive and it even supported Windows 7.</p>

<p>It would crash at every single loading screen. Playing on the lowest settings in a 800&#215;600 window lowered the number of crashes greatly but the loading times were still absolutely ridiculous. I even managed to finish crocheting a bag while waiting for the game to load.</p>

<p>Every time the game would crash or I was doing something and mentioned my laptop being slow, my SO would ask me, &ldquo;When are you going to get a new laptop?&rdquo; I waffled a little bit on the subject. Gaming laptops cost quite a lot. However, it&rsquo;s still an investment. I imagined doing multitasking on a new laptop. I could run a VM, Visual Studio, a web browser, and maybe even a game at the same time.</p>

<p>My SO and I spent a couple of weeks looking at laptops and even PC builds. Obviously, I opted out of the PC build. I do want to build my own PC one day but my space is limited and funds are low. When I move out and have a stable job, that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ll take the time to build my own PC. For now, I&rsquo;m settling for a laptop.</p>

<p>This laptop was $100 or so discounted. It still cost around $1.3k, $1.5k including warranty (in my opinion, you&rsquo;d be crazy not buy something so expensive without warranty). I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good price for what I got.</p>

<p>The main (and pretty much only) criteria we were looking for was a good graphics card. I suggested laptops from the GTX 900 series as they were cheaper but in the end, the laptop I got was a GTX 1000 series graphics card. There were others things we looked at as well, like having up to date Bluetooth, an appropriate number of USB ports, and a good size that wouldn&rsquo;t be too heavy for me.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided on Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD. The 16GB RAM was an added bonus for me. It was $70 over my budget of $1.2k but it was worth the extra RAM.</p>

<p>I put in an order on Memory Express and picked it up the next day! There was a bit of a complication. My bank has a limit on the amount you can spend on one purchase so I had to call the bank to fix it. I also had to run back to work with a very heavy box since that took longer than I thought and I picked it up during my lunch break.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place and I set up the laptop. We oohed and aahed over the shiny laptop. So far, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it!</p>

<p>Do you read a lot of diverse or own voices books? Why or why not? Submitted by Kitty @ <a href="http://vicariousbookworm.wordpress.com/">Vicarious Bookworm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm&#8230; I&rsquo;m not sure what this question means so I&rsquo;m going to take a stab at it! Of course, I love a lot of variety with the different voices I read in books. It gets tiring reading about a smart intellectual and independent woman in the French Revolution the thirtieth time. I love exploring different characters from all walks life. Monotony is boring! I also love different types of books, both fiction and non-fiction, novels or graphic novels, etc.</p>
