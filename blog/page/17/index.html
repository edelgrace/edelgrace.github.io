<blockquote>
<p>If you could have lunch with any living authors and/or book bloggers, who would you choose and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh man, the living restriction is a tough one. If language wasn&rsquo;t a barrier, I would definitely have lunch with Haruki Murakami. Although I have mixed feelings on his work, I feel like it would be pretty nice to sit down with him and chat over a cup of tea overlooking Tokyo (I&rsquo;m assuming he lives in Tokyo) in some little cafe. I&rsquo;d probably just let him talk about his views on life, his running, his portrayal of women in his novels, and so on.</p>

<p>If language is a barrier, I just might have to sit down and have a chat with Lucy Kinsley. If you are unfamiliar with Lucy, she is an artist with a couple of graphic novels under her belt. I will admit I have a little admiration crush on Lucy. She seems like a fun-loving quirky woman and she would probably know the best hidden place to have lunch at.</p>

        <p>Hooked on Crochet is a Discord server that I am a part of. If you don&rsquo;t know what Discord is, it is essentially a chat client for gamers. You can create your own &ldquo;servers&rdquo; or chat rooms for dedicated topics. Hooked on Crochet is (obviously) a group of crocheters. They organized a yarn swap last spring which I took a part of.</p>

<p>My gifter got me a set of hand dyed Alpaca yarn, a llama stitch marker, and a pattern for a unicorn amigurumi! I really love the stitch marker, it&rsquo;s very cute and handy. The yarn I am planning to use for a shawl eventually, at least that is my plan for it. I will also eventually make a unicorn for one of my cousin&rsquo;s kids, while they&rsquo;re still young.</p>

<p>While I didn&rsquo;t get to take any pictures of the actual yarn I managed to get for my giftee, I did get a picture of the package that I eventually sent out. I also bought him a yarn swift from Amazon from a gift card that I had. What I ended up buying for him was otter stitch markers, a skein of yarn bought from Etsy, Caron Cakes, and some local yarn.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great experience! I got some cool yarn out of it which was sweet. And I love the fact that my giftee was totally over the moon with what I got him. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would do again!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nine Island is an intimate autobiographical novel, told by J, a woman who lives in a glass tower on one of Miami Beach’s lush Venetian Islands. After decades of disaster with men, she is trying to decide whether to withdraw forever from romantic love. Having just returned to Miami from a monthlong reunion with an old flame, “Sir Gold,” and a visit to her fragile mother, J begins translating Ovid’s magical stories about the transformations caused by Eros. “A woman who wants, a man who wants nothing. These two have stalked the world for thousands of years,” she thinks.</p>

<p>When not ruminating over her sexual past and current fantasies, in the company of only her aging cat, J observes the comic, sometimes steamy goings-on among her faded-glamour condo neighbors. One of them, a caring nurse, befriends her, eventually offering the opinion that “if you retire from love&#8230; then you retire from life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m a 22 year old who has had thoughts about giving up on love. Of course, this book intrigued me. What would a middle aged woman&rsquo;s life be like alone and loveless? The protagonist, J, tries to sort out exactly what she wants in life after getting divorced and rekindling an old flame that ultimately went nowhere. At first her cat, mother, and neighbours seem to sustain her. But the past is always creeping up in the back of her mind. When is it okay to give up on love? One of the main characters profoundly remarks, &ldquo;To retire from love is to retire from life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This book has given me a lot of food for thought. I hoped to gain some insights but I don&rsquo;t feel any less confused or more confused after reading it. There seems to be a lot going towards trying to find love. I expressed my feelings of becoming a cat lady to a friend and she replied with, &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s going to take care of you when you&rsquo;re old? If you die, your cats will just eat you.&rdquo; She has a point, which Alison also touched on in the book. Most people who have a family are usually taken care of by their children. Sure, I could admit myself to a retirement home if I get that old but maybe it might be different if I had kids.</p>

<p>And as a human being with certain needs and urges, I thought that I could just, you know, take care of myself in that department when I&rsquo;m older and alone. Alison also addressed this. Ultimately, it really depends if you&rsquo;re okay with that and if you could sustain yourself that way. I think I could get by.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s also the loneliness factor. J focuses greatly on her work translating Ovid and her little side project of trying to save a duck. Her hobbies are a little off the wall but are they really hobbies or are they just distractions? I myself have a wealth of projects that should keep me busy and content but they don&rsquo;t always fill as much space as I would like them to sometimes.</p>

<p>Human contact is also a must which J gets no shortage of. Her neighbours, her cat, her past flings, and her mother are all social outlets that she utilizes. I&rsquo;ve entertained the idea of becoming a complete social recluse but I know that would not go out well. As much of an introvert that I (think I) am, I do enjoy being around people. I feel more human that way.</p>

<p>With all these thoughts swirling in my mind I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what to make of the arguments made in the book. There is really no hard conclusion that J comes to at the end. Maybe she&rsquo;ll stumble into love one day, maybe not. At the moment, she seems pretty okay with where her life is. So is the moral of the story to just go with the flow and take opportunities where they crop up? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>While I did focus a little too much on the content, it&rsquo;s not hard to notice that Alison&rsquo;s writing is absolutely dreamy. Her words float around you and bite at you with clever quips and wise insights. Her characters are all a little quirky and feel almost not real but it&rsquo;s not hard to believe people like these exist. I wish I could have slowed down a little bit more to absorb how well written this book was but I was too engrossed in the story.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed this book. I ate it up in two days after a reading dry spell. God, who knew Jane Austen could be so boring sometimes (I was in the process of reading <em>Northanger Abbey</em> at the time)? So this little novel was a good change of pace.</p>

<p>I have books, bookish items, and non-bookish items on my shelves. Actually my shelves are in a pretty sorry state. There is a lot of clutter on them and they&rsquo;re usually my go to place to put things when I have no idea where to put them. If I wasn&rsquo;t ashamed I would post a picture of my shelves but no one needs to see that!</p>

<p>Ideally, my shelves would only contain books. I&rsquo;m not quite so sure about bookish things. I guess a handful of bookmarks would be appropriate on shelves. I want to cut down on my figurines and memorabilia so I am hesitating on putting book related objects like those on my shelves.</p>

        <p>I took a little break during the month of May. My mental health was honestly at an all time low and I found myself having a hard time picking myself back up to get motivated to actually do things. Since I am around 6 months into my 22nd year of living, I thought it would be a good time to pause and reflect how I&rsquo;m doing with my 25 before 25. I only two and a half years left after all.</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong>: Good progress</p>

<p>I am on track with this, thankfully! So far I am passing all of my courses and seem to look good to graduate at the end of the year. I still need to register for one more course in September but I&rsquo;m having trouble finding a course that I am interested in that won&rsquo;t conflict with other courses.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents’ house</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>My moving out fund is slowly getting chipped away due to paying for tuition. I still need a job secured for this summer. I really want to get one ASAP so I can get that cash flow going.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>When I was on internship, I put most of my paycheque into my TFSA. I still have a ways to go before maxing out my TFSA but I definitely have the funds in there. They will not be touched for a while.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open a RRSP account</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This won&rsquo;t happen until I get a semi-permanent job and I don&rsquo;t see that happening until I graduate. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This also won&rsquo;t happen until I graduate.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong>: Good progress</p>

<p>This year I have read around 36 books. There are still half a year left so I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m ahead of the game for this year.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong>: Little progress</p>

<p>I started playing The Witcher 3 and unfortunately, most of my gaming time has been spent on that. This has been a good reminder for me to boot up Origins sometime soon.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to code lately but I need to get started planning this seriously. Maybe I will dedicate this weekend to do so.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>As said before, haven&rsquo;t done a lot of coding this year. I also need to draw a good plan for this.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Woah, look at all these projects I haven&rsquo;t started on yet. I need to figure out which project to prioritize first. This website has been a long time coming but the TCG will be the most work. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver’s license</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Have yet to sit in the driver&rsquo;s seat yet this year. I have to check my learner&rsquo;s permit and see when it expires. I need a teacher and my poor father is reluctant to teach me because I am unsafe.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong>: Negligible progress</p>

<p>My mental health stumbling block last month has done a lot for me to trip up on this. I am struggling with making friends in general right now and I&rsquo;m finding it extremely hard. I started going to crochet meetups and will hopefully go regularly enough to make a friend or two.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>In May I felt like I regressed a lot but I am starting to go back to the gym. Yesterday I went to the gym on campus and my nerves only got me to do some cardio on the machines but I did something which was relieving.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Nope. Hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. Starting today.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water.</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>When I was sitting around at work, I was drinking a lot of water. Now back at school, I&rsquo;m finding it hard to remember to drink water. In fact, I&rsquo;m thirsty right now. I will go and get some water right now. Water break!</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong>: Little progress</p>

<p>My mom left the country to go the Philippines in May. I got some opportunities to cook. Just really small things. Made pizza, chicken wings, breakfast. Nothing hardcore.</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I need that cash first and foremost.</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This summer vacation, for sure.</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong>: Almost there</p>

<p>I got tipsy once so far. It was weird. Almost there. One day.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I kinda gave up my CCNA courses so I just might start to study on my own.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the start of summer so I will have to wait until winter comes back around to go to Zoo Lights.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>I am currently doing some counseling to combat this. Also taking part of an online cognitive behavioural therapy course. Exercise will hopefully help as well.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m such a bad pen pal. 🙁 Gah! I don&rsquo;t have a P.O. box anymore and I&rsquo;m not entirely comfortable not using one. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t seen any concerts that caught my eye yet. Wait, let me check right now. Nope, nothing catches my eye at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>I watched Ella Enchanted. That&rsquo;s one out of many, right?</p>
