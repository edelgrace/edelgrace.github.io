        <p>Right now I&rsquo;m in a quest to find a hobby that doesn&rsquo;t involve sitting in front of a screen. I recently started learning the guitar and now I&rsquo;ve decided to add crocheting onto my plate. I have always been secretly envious of those who can knit and/or crochet. I love it when someone busts out a project their working on while on the bus and train. I also adore the small little crocheted toys that I see around the net. My SO received a crocheted Yoshi which was the cutest thing ever.</p>

<p>I ordered a set of hooks and some yarn online. However, to tide me over until they arrive, I dropped by Wal-Mart to grab some cheap things.</p>

<p>In total, some stitch markers, a 5mm crochet hook, and two small balls of yarn cost me $13.63 including tax. Not bad, I guess. I still don&rsquo;t really know how much these things should cost and what I should expect in terms of quality. But since I&rsquo;m still beginning, I figured I may as well not spend too much on high end items.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I finally got to watch <em>Arrival</em> the other day. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly everything that I expected but I think I wasn&rsquo;t displeased with the twist.</p>

<p>The fist half of the movie follows Louise, a professor who specializes in languages and translations. She is recruited by the government to help translate the language of aliens who had touched down on earth. Together with a mathematician, Ian, they slowly learn the writing system of the aliens.</p>

<p>At the climax, the aliens are at risk of being attacked by multiple countries around the world. This is when it is revealed that Louise can experience the future. She uses her glimpses of the future to piece together how exactly she had to prevent the attack on the aliens.</p>

<p>Throughout the movie, Louise had been seeing visions of her child. I initially thought these were flashbacks from the past and that the stress of sleepless nights had resurfaced painful memories for Louise. What was really happening was that Louise had been experiencing the future and the present simultaneously.</p>

<p>Louise marries her partner Ian and have a child together and that child is the one Louise had seen in her episodes into the future. While still in the present, Louise experiences multiple memories with her daughter Hannah and eventually learns that Hannah has an incurable disease that causes her to die in her teens.</p>

<p>This part of the movie caused great confusion for my SO and I.</p>

<p>If Louise knew that her daughter would have to suffer and die early, why did she choose to have her at all?</p>

<p>One of the arguments that I think is the most forgivable is that Louise is not able to control the outcome of her future, despite being able to see it. That is, her future is predetermined and she can&rsquo;t change her future no matter what. So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that she knows what&rsquo;s going to happen if she can&rsquo;t change it.</p>

<p>A counter argument is that when she experiences the future, it is happening and she can make choices. There is hard evidence in the movie that supports this argument. When Louise is talking to her daughter at the lake, she asks her what day it is because she isn&rsquo;t sure that what is happening is real or just a vision. Another scenario is when she is trying to think of a term for her daughter and it isn&rsquo;t until she hears someone say it in the present that she can tell her daughter the term in the future.</p>

<p>In terms of morality, I have mixed feelings. Is it immoral of Louise to bring her daughter into the world if she knew her daughter would suffer? It&rsquo;s a touchy subject and I cannot come to a complete decision on the topic.</p>

<p>On one hand, I&rsquo;m a firm believer of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better to have loved and lost than to not love at all.&rdquo; As a result of knowing Hannah&rsquo;s future, Louise is able to cherish each and every moment with her daughter. She loves Hannah with ever fiber of her being. Who&rsquo;s to say that Hannah&rsquo;s happier years weren&rsquo;t worth it?</p>

<p>While I also believe in a women&rsquo;s choice to do whatever she wants with her body, this situation is different because her actions absolutely impacts another person&rsquo;s life negatively. It&rsquo;s unfair that someone so young and just beginning her life would have it cut short. Some people might say it is cruel and irresponsible for Louise to bring her daughter into the world.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what to think of it but I keep turning it over in my mind. Louise doesn&rsquo;t really have a rare circumstance. Some people have genetic disorders that can be passed down to their own kids. They have to choose whether or not they want to have kids or not. Some find out about a condition while the child is not yet born and they are faced with the same decision.</p>

<p>Is it up to the parents? Do some situations call for different actions or is there a universally ethical way of handling it? I don&rsquo;t know myself. I hope I don&rsquo;t have to choose and if I do, I hope I&rsquo;ll be confident in my answer.</p>

        <p>I have been following <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/">Justin Guitar</a>&#8216;s lesson plans for learning the guitar.</p>

<p>This week I went through the first 15 beginner&rsquo;s course lessons, BC-101 to BC-115. I learned the basics of choosing a guitar, posture, etc. In terms of actually playing, I learned the D chord, A chord, and E chord. The first two chords were incredibly &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; The chord that really stumped me was the E chord. I could not press down on the strings hard enough so that it didn&rsquo;t sound muted. It got easier in the middle of the week because my fingers hurt less from pressing down on the strings so often.</p>

<p>The lesson I&rsquo;m working on right now is trying to get the most chord changes in one minute. The idea is to aim for 30 changes in one minute. Speed is the main factor here and not so much how good it sounds.</p>

<p>Here are the results of my first two tries:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Chord</th>
<th>Round 1</th>
<th>Round 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>D chord &#8211; A chord</td>
<td>17 changes</td>
<td>27 changes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>D chord &#8211; E chord</td>
<td>21 changes</td>
<td>31 changes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>E chord &#8211; A chord</td>
<td>26 changes</td>
<td>30 changes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The next couple of lessons will be more chords, I predict. I&rsquo;m not quite sure. Hopefully I can stick to this for another week!</p>

        <p>I can count the number of times I have tried to make cheesecake on one hand. It&rsquo;s not that many but I count that as a quest to make the ultimate cheesecake. It&rsquo;s my favourite dessert. Yes, it&rsquo;s incredibly filling and calorie dense and expensive but I love it. The expensiveness factor is a big reason why I&rsquo;m trying to perfect the art of the cheesecake.</p>

<p>On my first attempt back in high school, it tasted lke cream cheese on a graham cracker crust. Definitely not quality cheesecake material.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re stingy on saving electricity, my next two attempts were of the no bake variety. They were good but they didn&rsquo;t taste like cheesecake at all. It tasted more like a heavy cream pie. But it was still delicious.</p>

<p>For Valentine&rsquo;s Day, I baked my first actual cheesecake. I followed a recipe on Reddit. It was a cheesecake but with a brownie bottom instead of the traditional graham cracker crust. I was a little stressed because I had bought less cream cheese than I needed and it seemed like it just spread over the brownie like a thin layer of icing. Also when I was cutting it, it was hard to pry it from the pan. I was worried the brownie had burnt but some parts of it weren&rsquo;t actually that cooked&#8230;</p>

<p>However, it was my closest attempt to an actual cheesecake I had ever made. It. Was. Delicious. When I got home from work, my brother and mom had almost eaten all of it.</p>

<p>Can you read and watch TV or listen to the radio at the same time? Submitted by Elizabeth @ [Silver&rsquo;s Reviews]()</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope! Unless we&rsquo;re talking about dry, academic textbooks. I can read the words but nothing will go into my head. I do like multitasking with audiobooks but only when the task is mindless enough that I can pay attention to the story. For example, one time I was playing <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> (a video game) while listening to the audiobook <em>Waiting</em> by Ha Jin. In the game I was just slaughtering enemies while exploring a forest. Not much to truly pay attention to. Other than that, I cannot read at the same time!</p>
