<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These are my own opinions of these restaurants, this post is <strong><em>not</em></strong> sponsored!</p>

<p>This weekend was a very filling one. Each day I was eating something yummy, somewhere!</p>

<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>

<p>My brother and my cousin went to <a href="https://www.bluefinsushiab.com/">Blue Fin Sushi</a>. They have an all you can eat lunch pretty cheaply for $17.84 CAD. No limits or anything! I was supposed to go with them last week but I ended up missing it. Last week my cousin ate so much he threw up. I took that as a good sign that they wouldn&rsquo;t skimp out on the food.</p>

<p>So my brother and cousin suggested to go again and I could finally go with them! I had been waiting for this lunch the entire week. I definitely did not push myself to the point of throwing up but I did eat enough to feel considerably full. I could have powered through one more order but it is a lot of sushi!</p>

<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>

<p>My birthday was last December. I originally planned for a lunch but the weather was extremely bad. It snowed quite a lot and the roads were terrible for driving. So I cancelled it and then rescheduled! Unfortunately not everyone could make it still but still had good attendance.</p>

<p>The person who couldn&rsquo;t make it was the person we were counting on guiding us through the menu since he&rsquo;s been there a couple of times. I decided on going to <a href="http://www.moonkoreanbbq.com/">Moon Korean BBQ</a> because I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but rave reviews about it from my friends. It was the cutest little restaurant. The decor was minimalistic but also homely with some Korean pop music going on in the background.</p>

<p>They even had the cutest cutlery sets!</p>

<p>Anyway, we ended up just getting the all you can eat menu. We had a two hour time limit of 10 different items per round. We ate a lot of meat and opted for grilling our food ourselves (but not without some handholding from our server).</p>

<p>The food was absolutely delicious. I wish I remembered to buy cheesecake for dessert though. 10 out of 10, would eat again!</p>

<h2 id="sunday">Sunday</h2>

<p>Sunday was much less glamorous. My cousin had coupons for Taco Time and we just went and bought burritos. I bought a beef and cheese burrito and, man, it is a lot of meat. I could not finish it and felt full for the rest of the day. We also went to buy timbits for a snack afterwards.</p>

<p>There was a Goodwill nearby and we decided to drop in. I&rsquo;ve never been there before and wanted to see what was there. There were a bunch of cheap tea sets that made me think of <em>Moon Korean BBQ</em>. I know where I will shop for my dishes and such for when I move out!</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>

<p>This weekend was really nice! I spent too much money and calories on food, however. I&rsquo;m hoping to cut down on all this food from this point forward.</p>

<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>

<p><strong>Today’s mantra:</strong> I have the willpower to wait!</p>

<p><strong>Today’s action:</strong> Enact the 72 hour waiting period starting today and continuing for the rest of the month.</p>

<p><strong>Today’s recommended reading:</strong> <a href="http://www.frugalwoods.com/2017/01/09/my-foolproof-method-to-stop-impulse-spending/">My Foolproof Method To Stop Impulse Spending</a></p>

<p>I definitely struggle with impulse spending. Any physical item that I have bought, I have usually bought it on impulse. Food is the same way. It isn&rsquo;t until I see something in the food court or on display that I think, &ldquo;I would like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do have a wishlist that I keep. It isn&rsquo;t very long and I don&rsquo;t always remember to add to it but it definitely curbs my spending. There are some items that have been there for months and I still can&rsquo;t justify buying them. I think that&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>

<h2 id="day-4">Day 4</h2>

<p><strong>Today’s mantra:</strong> Managing your money—and growing your wealth—isn’t about complex day trading or bizarre get rich quick schemes, it’s about following the simple premise of “spend less than you earn—invest the surplus—avoid debt.”</p>

<p><strong>Today’s action:</strong> Use this calculator to determine how much money you’d have in the future if you eliminated a few recurring expenses and instead invested them.</p>

<p><strong>Today’s recommended reading:</strong> Want to learn how to start investing? Here you go: <a href="http://www.frugalwoods.com/2016/06/20/for-the-love-of-frugal-hound-manage-your-money-yourself-by-following-the-simple-path-to-wealth/">For the Love of Frugal Hound, Manage Your Money Yourself! (by following The Simple Path to Wealth)</a></p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>I used the calculator. Every month I pay the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Netflix</p></li>

<li><p>Amazon Prime (saved)</p></li>

<li><p>Gym membership</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This costs me $40 each month. If I saved that and assumed 7% annual return, I would end up with $14,420.90 after 30 years. That&rsquo;s quite a lot but not as much I first thought. I think this exercise would be worth doing again once I move out.</p>

<p>I did take a look at the reading. I&rsquo;m the type of person who would not do well managing my own portfolio. Instead I use a robo-advisor, <a href="wealthsimple.com/invite/VX1BUQ">Wealthsimple</a> (referral link) to do it for me. It&rsquo;s 0.5% fee however it&rsquo;s worth paying it for the convenience. I would mess up anyway.</p>

<p>I just finished a block week course (a week long course ) on history of early modern Europe and I was bit by the Rrenaissance bug. Historial fiction is one of my favourite genres across multiple media. Over the winter break, I even watched <em>The Crown</em> and <em>Downton Abbey</em> on Netflix.</p>

<p>Thank goodness for Netflix. I find Netflix a great way to multitask on crochet projects. I started on this <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lost-in-time">Lost in Time shawl</a>. The crochet Discord server I&rsquo;m a part of has this for our January crochet along. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun so far! I&rsquo;m not sure how closely I&rsquo;m following it though. I had to redo the popcorn bits a couple of times.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I went to a nice Korean BBQ place with my SO. It was my first time trying bi-bim-bap and it was sooo delicious.</p>

<p>Overall my week was pretty low key. Spent most of it on school related matters and yarn matters.</p>

<p>This week my goals are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Continue not buying food on campus. Last week I was successful so hopefully I can replicate my results.</p></li>

<li><p>Draft up two blog posts. This is one of them so I&rsquo;m already halfway through!</p></li>

<li><p>Finish my first draft of my &ldquo;essay&rdquo; that I have to do for my history course. It&rsquo;s such a slow grind.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Until next time!</p>

<h2 id="the-homework">The Homework</h2>

<h3 id="the-dream-bio">The Dream Bio</h3>

<p><strong>My Actual Bio</strong></p>

<p>I was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to two Filipino immigrant parents. All my life I have always been a person who created things. I loved to write, draw, and do little crafts. One of my elementary school teachers remarked that I was &ldquo;always making something.&rdquo; And I find that to still be true today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a good student even though sometimes I got frequent boughts of procrastination episodes. I loved being on the computer and my love for creating extended into technology. My hobbies soon included making websites and publishing fanfiction on the Internet. Naturally this led me to getting a degree in Computer Science.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t all smooth sailing however. I originally was accepted into engineering for university. But my procrastinating ways and lack of passion for the subjects didn&rsquo;t result in the greatest grades. Unsure if I was going to be able to return to school, I took up a job over the summer and saved around $2k.</p>

<p>Thankfully I was able to transfer into Computer Science the following fall. Ever since then I&rsquo;ve beem focused on my studies. I managed to get an internship at a great company who leads in telecommunications in my country. It was a great learning experience and I got to save a good chunk of money.</p>

<p><strong>The Dream Bio</strong></p>

<p>I am a successful software developer at a company that does not reside in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I&rsquo;m able to work remotely and this enables me to go on short travelling trips. I make decent enough money that I am FIRE&rsquo;d. I alternate between work and travelling to different countries. I&rsquo;ve spent a couple of weeks in Japan, South Korea, England, France, Italy, Spain, the U.S., Denmark, etc.</p>

<p>I have a small house or apartment that I can return to in my hometown, wherever that is. I&rsquo;ll have a cat or two or ten. At nights I sit by the window with coffee and my laptop and work on my blogging. Or I might corchet or read a good book.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not there yet! I need to accomplish a few things first before any of this happens. The step sI need to take are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Graduate</p></li>

<li><p>Land a good paying job</p></li>

<li><p>Save a more than 50% of my paycheck</p></li>

<li><p>Spend less to compliment my saving</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reflect-back-on-your-life-at-95">Reflect back on your life at 95</h3>

<p>I lived my life to the fullest. I got to experience many cultures, food, and ideas. I learned many things. I got to create many things. I fostered relationships with many people from many places. I managed to find the love of my life. I loved almost every second of it. I want people to know me as someone who is loving and caring but also adventurous and ambitious.</p>

<h3 id="perform-a-time-audit">Perform a Time Audit</h3>

<p>I will make an effort to track my time! I currently use Google Docs to plan my day but not to track what actually happens. Will take a stab at this.</p>

        <p>I went back to school today. It&rsquo;s a little weird to be back at school but also familiar. This semester is going to be a light one. I&rsquo;m only taking two courses. One course is only five days long. So essentially I just have one course throughout the semester!</p>

<p>The block week course I&rsquo;m taking right now is just a history course but it&rsquo;s really interesting. I&rsquo;ve always found history fascinating but I was never great at being tested on or writing about history. I just like listening to a story, basically. The assignments are a little grueling, we have to write 1000 words each day. 1000 words is a lot to me. At least so I thought and then I realized I went over the word limit for today. I&rsquo;ll cut it down later.</p>

<p>My professor is pretty awesome. He has a wealth of information that just comes out so easily and eloquently. He&rsquo;s funny to boot. He made a <em>Downton Abbey</em> reference which I appreciated. Over the Christmas break I took the opportunity to finish all of <em>Downton Abbey</em>. Today&rsquo;s lecture really put into perspective all of the crazy titles some of the characters have. It&rsquo;s kinda crazy to think that the titles were still relevant all the way into the 1930&rsquo;s!</p>

<p>Hopefully I survive the rest of the week. 6 hour days will never cease to be brutal for me&hellip;</p>
