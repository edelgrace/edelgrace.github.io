        <h4>Jan 7, 2017 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/websites/phew-i-moved-my-fanlistings/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
        
        <div class="tags">
            <ul>
              
              <li><a href="/categories/websites">Websites</a></li>            
              
  
              
              <li><a href="/tags/fanlistings">#fanlistings</a></li>
              
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Fanlistings are basically the early 2000&rsquo;s version of Facebook pages. I <a href="http://fan.edelgrace.me">own a bunch of them</a>, mostly of songs or video game characters. Honestly, the whole fanlisting thing has been going down in popularity as the years go by. It&rsquo;s a bit sad. Fanlistings come and go a lot. There&rsquo;s a high turnover rate. I try my best to maintain and keep mine up and running.</p>

<p>However, my old domain name expired and I had trouble getting in touch with my registrar to renew it. I really loved that domain name because it featured my frequently used user handle but I determined it to be a lost cause and ultimately let it go. Since GitHub introduced the student pack which included a .me domain for free for one year, I claimed it. Hence, <em>edelgrace.me</em> was born.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m using $50 credit from <a href="https://m.do.co/c/999dd787b62c">Digital Ocean</a> (yes, that is a referral link) for an Ubuntu droplet. However, it only runs on 512MB RAM so I opted to buy a cheap 1GB RAM server from <a href="http://ramnode.com">RamNode</a> (no, that is actually not a referral link). 512MB RAM would probably be enough for me since I don&rsquo;t receive many visits to my websites but you never know what the future might bring.</p>

<p>So on the event of my domain expiring, I moved all of my fanlistings over to the RamNode server. I exported a SQL file through phpMyAdmin from my website to recreate the database and ran it on the server. Since I wanted better naming conventions, I had to change all the config files in order to connect to the database. There were some issues that I had to plow through in Enthusiast, one being that the absolute path to the fanlisting script needed to be changed. Since I&rsquo;m no longer of thinking of sticking to hosting but rather maintaining my own servers, I don&rsquo;t think I should have to worry about changing the path ever again.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I had to contact <a href="http://thefanlistings.org">The Fanlisting Network</a> (TFL) in order to change my URLs. The network is to ensure that duplicate fanlistings don&rsquo;t exist. In theory, duplicate fanlistings can exist but the ones listed on TFL are more trusted.</p>

<p>In summary, that was my evening last night. It took up more time than I wanted but that&rsquo;s okay. I still managed to get some studying for CCNA done so all went well.</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s your favourite place to read? Submitted by Ronyell @ <a href="http://rabbitearsbookblog.blogspot.com/">Rabbit Ears Book Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will be honest&#8230; I don&rsquo;t think I have a favourite place, as long as I&rsquo;m reading. In terms of places where I usually read is on the bus or when I&rsquo;m eating. I wish I had a better place to read, it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve sat down in a dedicated spot for reading at home.</p>

        <p>Today I learned about IGMP, which stands for Internet Group Message Protocol. There are three different ways packets are sent out to other devices. There&rsquo;s unicast, which just sends a packet to one specific device. Then there&rsquo;s broadcast, which sends packets to all the devices that is in the network. Lastly, there&rsquo;s multicast. Multicast sends packets to more than one device but not all the devices.</p>

<p>If a device wants to be part of a multicast group, it sends out an IGMP packet, or more specifically, an IGMP join packet. The join packet expresses the device&rsquo;s desire to subscribe to the multicast feed.</p>

<p>Usually, a switch is the receiving end of this join request. If IGMP snooping is enabled on the switch, it will listen for requests and add the device to the group.</p>

        <p>Identify traffic with an access-list</p>

<pre>access-list <em>acl-name</em> permit ip <em>source</em> <em>destination</em> dscp <em>dscp-value</em></pre>

<p>Apply the access-list with the dscp value to an interfact</p>

<pre>class-map match-all <em>interface</em>
match ip dscp <em>dscp-value</em></pre>

<p>Apply the policy</p>

<pre>policy-map <em>map-name</em>

        [bandwidth <em>bandwidth-value</em>]
        [priority <em>priority-level</em>]
        set ip dscp <em>dscp-value</em></pre>

<p>Today at work I was going over firewalls. We want to check the configuration of the firewalls and compare them to our QoS standards. I&rsquo;m not too familiar with how policies and QoS are implemented on Cisco devices so it was pretty interesting to learn.</p>

        <p>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&rsquo;s network&#8230; Kinda rough.</p>

<p>However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently doing an inventory of our gear and before I left for holidays, I was labelling items that needed to be recycled or sold. Apparently some of the labels fell off so I reinforced them all with tape. Since I was gone for two weeks, there were a couple of new devices in our inventory so I took note of those as well.</p>

<p>Some of the devices are strewn about the place with no order so I attempted to move some of them into groups of device types. For example, some of the supervisor engines were mixed with the switches when there was a shelf dedicated solely for engines.</p>

<p>We use bins to store smaller items. Some of the bins didn&rsquo;t have any labels so I had to make some in order for people to know where everything is. I also labelled some ambiguos boxes. It&rsquo;s a big guessing game looking at them all.</p>

<p>I received a package from Meraki containing a Meraki access point. Pretty cool! I thought that maybe I needed to do something with it for work so I read the manual but it turned out that it&rsquo;s mine to keep. It&rsquo;s super sleek.</p>

<p>In my co-op, I have to hand in reports in order to get credit. One of the first things I have to hand in during the start of the work term is learning objectives. I spent a good amount of time trying to think up of what I wanted to accomplish during this work term. I&rsquo;m still pretty undecided as I don&rsquo;t want to repeat myself from last term&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place. While he played Vermintide with friends, I continued reading <em>Buried in Books</em> by Julie Rugg. Basically it&rsquo;s a collection of quotes regarding books and reading. I love reading books about books and reading. What Ilove more is reading a book about books that are about books and reading.</p>

<p>After that we settled in for some quiet time to work on a puzzle I bought him for Christmas. It&rsquo;s a big 1000 piece puzzle of a volcano. I chose it because it was cool and dramatic and it was more than two colours. I guess some people like the challenge of putting together a puzzle of the ocean and the sky but not us.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my day in a nutshell. A very chill and relaxing day. Now I&rsquo;m hoping to tinker with the access point I received, work out a little, and study a bit for my CCNA before I hit the hay.</p>
