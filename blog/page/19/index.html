<p>This is a month-long challenge held over at <a href="http://www.frugalwoods.com/2016/12/19/uber-frugal-month-the-ultimate-guide-to-saving-more-money-than-you-ever-thought-possible/">Frugalwoods</a>. Feel free to join whenever you can!</p>

<p><strong>Today&rsquo;s Mantra:</strong> Anything in life that’s worth doing takes effort.</p>

<p><strong>Today&rsquo;s Action:</strong> Write down why you’re participating in the Uber and answers to</p>

<h2 id="the-homework">The Homework</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-establish-your-goals">Step 1: Establish your goals</h3>

<p><strong>Why are you participating in this challenge?</strong></p>

<p>I want to build good spending habits for when I move out. I currently still live with my parents and admittedly am still quite spoiled. I&rsquo;ve had most things paid for me and have a &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; if my spending ever gets out of hand.</p>

<p><strong>What do you hope to achieve?</strong></p>

<p>I hope I can nip frivolous spending in the bud. I really want to cut out expenses that I really don&rsquo;t need.</p>

<p><strong>What are your longterm life goals?</strong></p>

<p>Oof this is a big question. I&rsquo;d love to be FIRE (financially independent and retire early). There are many hobbies and pursuits I&rsquo;d love to devote myself to. I want to learn languages, read a lot of books, learn hpw to play guitar, keep on crocheting and knitting, blog about life, travel&hellip; The list goes on.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you want to be in 10 years?</strong></p>

<p>Graduated. Moved out. In a city that isn&rsquo;t Calgary. Workimg a job I don&rsquo;t despise. Be close to RE and already FI.</p>

<p><strong>What about your current lifestyle might prevent those goals from coming to fruition and what can you do about it?</strong></p>

<p>I am spending too much and saving too little. I need to build those habits and learn to live without.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-review-last-month-s-spending">Step 2: Review last month&rsquo;s spending</h3>

<p>I use <a href="http://youneedabudget.com">You Need a Budget</a> to track my spending. It&rsquo;s a great app and I&rsquo;ve been using it for a whie now. I&rsquo;m a little hesitant to look at my December spending but let&rsquo;s jump in anyway&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dvozrk6m8/image/upload/v1514827353/Capture__2018-01-01-10-21-12_ttq7st.png" alt="December spending pie chart"></p>

<p>$733.12 CAD doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot but it is when you take into the fact that I have no income and all that money is coming from my savings.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that most of my spending is &ldquo;Just for Fun.&rdquo; This is the category I use for eating out and my hobbies.</p>

<p>I spent about what I expected for gifts. I budget $200 for 4 people. Then I had to add 2 more people for Secret Santas. So all in all, $179.28 for 6 people isn&rsquo;t bad!</p>

<p>My bills include my phone, tuition, therapy, and any account fees. I don&rsquo;t see myself reducing this any further.</p>

<p>Optional bills are gym and Netflix. I share a Netflix account with my SO and we split the bill but it does come from my card. We both use it a lot so it justifies the spend. I didn&rsquo;t go to the gym more than once last month but I share the membership with my brother. I need to downgrade my membership as I still intend on going to the gym.</p>

<p>Expenses are clothes. I did have one unnecessary clothes purchase. I don&rsquo;t regret it at all and my SO was pleased but it was still unncessary.</p>

<p>Since Sears was closing down they put everything on clearance. I managed to buy four cute orange plates for my future apartment just for $6.22.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-categorize-your-expenses">Step 3: CategorIze your expenses</h3>

<p>Done and done. Anything not bills are discretionary.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-what-can-i-eliminate-entirely">Step 4: What can I eliminate entirely?</h3>

<p>This is tough. I would love to no longer eat out but that is a good chunk of my expenses.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clothes:</strong> I got tons of clothes for Chrisrmas. I don&rsquo;t need anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee:</strong> I don&rsquo;t even like coffee and I always feel gross and groggy.</li>
<li><strong>Eating out on campus:</strong> I can&rsquo;t avoid eating out entirely because date nights but I really do not need to eat out on campus. I&rsquo;ll bring my own food.</li>
<li><strong>Yarn:</strong> While I didn&rsquo;t get any yarn last month I do not need any more yarn and I always impulse buy yarn.</li>
<li><strong>Future moving out items:</strong> That can wait for when I have cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Books:</strong> Who needs to buy books when you have free library memberships??</li>
<li><strong>Video games:</strong> I have a ton that need playing still. No steam sales for me!</li>
<li><strong>Gym membership:</strong> This is a hard maybe. I prefer the gym equipment. I might just downgrade it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-5-embrace-the-art-of-substitution">Step 5: Embrace the art of substitution</h3>

<ul>
<li>Coffee = homemade tea. We have a bunch of peppermint tea bags. I should use them.</li>
<li>Expensive gym = less expensive gym. I currently pay $22 per month for my gym. I can downgrade to $12.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-6-reduce-spending-on-discretionary-expenses">Step 6: Reduce spending on discretionary expenses</h3>

<p>The main thing here is food. My SO and I eat out a lot. Time to load up on coupons amd cashback deals and get the cheapest options or smaller portions.</p>

<h3 id="step-7-empower-yourself-to-insource">Step 7: Empower yourself to insource</h3>

<p>I could have insourced a lot of my gifts from last month since I know how to crochet and knit. Time to load up on mitts, hats, gloves, scarves, and headbands.</p>

<h3 id="step-8-examine-your-habits">Step 8: Examine your habits</h3>

<p>Main places where I buy things: on campus, in the mall, at Walmart, Steam, Amazon, at my SO&rsquo;s house. I could avoid the campus food court entirely and refuse to come with my friends. I could not go to Walmart when I don&rsquo;t need to. I could start bringing food to my SO&rsquo;s house.</p>

<h3 id="step-9-plan-ahead">Step 9: Plan ahead</h3>

<p>I think the main theme here is to pack my own food!! That&rsquo;s my main flaw. I&rsquo;m too lazy and my own cooked food doesn&rsquo;t taste as good. Time to hone my cooking skills.</p>

<h3 id="step-10-if-you-do-buy-stuff-get-it-used-cheap">Step 10: If you do buy stuff, get it used/cheap</h3>

<p>Steps 8 and 9 pretty much covered this. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can get away with avoiding some of my spending completely.</p>

<h3 id="step-11-banish-excuses">Step 11: Banish excuses</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying! We&rsquo;ll see how this goes. I have no excuses for most of the things that I can eliminate.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR/Highlights</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t accomplish as much as I would have liked this year. However, this year was extremely eventful.</p>

<ul>
<li>Finished my internship and saved a lot of #MovingOut money</li>
<li>Started and finished self-esteem group therapy</li>
<li>Went to my first hackathon at Hack the North in Waterloo, Ontario</li>
<li>Attended both the Calgary Expo and Calgary Expo Holiday Market</li>
<li>Was a little more social this year</li>
<li>Ate a lot of good food (AKA went to a ton of restaurants and pubs)</li>
<li>Started crocheting and knitting</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a wild year. A lot of ups and downs. A lot of soul searching. I feel like I know more about myself and I have a clearer vision of the future that I want for myself.</p>

<h2 id="music-stats">Music Stats</h2>

<p>I religiously track my music stats through Last.fm. Spotify also publishes stats. Time to look at my music habits! Since I largely stopped pirating music, I turned to Spotify. This explains why I have almost stopped listening to music from Asian countries as a lot of musicians don&rsquo;t have their music on Spotify. There are some exceptions though. AOA is a Korean pop group and CAPSULE is a Japanese electronic music duo and they made it into my top 5 songs.</p>

<h2 id="25-before-25-goals">25 Before 25 Goals</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been one year since I posted my <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/life/25-before-25/">25 before 25</a>. Time to do a yearly review. I&rsquo;m now 23 and I have two more years before I turn 25. The pressure is on!</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on it! I will be graduating in April 2018. I originally thought I would have graduated by now but some of my first courses no longer count to my degree. Unfortunate, but true.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents&rsquo; house</strong></p>

<p>Not there yet. Waiting to graduate and get my first job. I have saved enough (I think) to move out but it&rsquo;s not a good idea to move out without a job.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong></p>

<p>Slowly chipping away at this. I contributed around $11k out of my $30k. With the new year, I have $25k left in my TFSA. I could do it&hellip; Right?</p>

<p><strong>4. Open an RRSP account</strong></p>

<p>Nope not yet. First job first.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong></p>

<p>Soon&hellip; Soon&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been updating my portfolio and resume and looking through job posts. My start date is still far in the future but I&rsquo;m determined.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong></p>

<p>I barely made it this year! I read more manga than I would have liked and non-fiction. I still need to get going on my to-read list.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely 0 progress on this one. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m procrastinating on playing a video game!</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong></p>

<p>Ditto with the above. I think that would be a good portfolio worth project. Maybe throughout the semester.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong></p>

<p>Not much progress on that either. Github says my last commit on that was in March 2017. So not a total failure.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong></p>

<p>Still in my backlog&hellip; I <em>will</em> get to it!</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver&rsquo;s license</strong></p>

<p>I think I might have to call it quits on this goal. I do not have the constitution to drive. I am too anxious, nervous, and space headed for me to be safe.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong></p>

<p>This is <em>so</em> hard. Most of my socializing this year was with my fellow interns and people in my degree. It&rsquo;s hard for me to relate to or get along with people who aren&rsquo;t at least a little bit nerdy like me. I will say however, there is one person that I&rsquo;ve getting along with lately and she is not a nerdy geek at all but she is friends with a lot of them. I&rsquo;ve known her for a while but never really fully went all in to the friendship.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong></p>

<p>I did okay in going to the gym this year but stopped halfway. It would be nice getting back to the gym.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong></p>

<p>I never remember to floss. I have now put it as a recurring card on my Trello board so it has to happen.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water</strong></p>

<p>Hmmmm. Not a lot of progress on this either. I think I&rsquo;m actually drinking less because I keep forgetting to bring my water bottle everywhere. Not anymore!</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done some cooking this year when my mom left for the Philippines. Not a whole lot. I&rsquo;ve been baking more than cooking. Baking is so much easier&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong></p>

<p>This one I came close to. I went on my first airplane flight without any of my family. It wasn&rsquo;t international, however, just across country. Now that I think about it, it&rsquo;s probably better that way, right? Baby steps. It was amazing. I love flying and going to new places.</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong></p>

<p>Thankfully, this is something I&rsquo;ve gotten started with. I have Konmari&rsquo;d my clothes so far. I still have a good chunk left to go through.</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong></p>

<p>I got tipsy this year. Baby steps.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong></p>

<p>After working in a networking role, I will pass on getting this certification or downgrade it to a CENT certification. I did like the work but I really want to flex my programming skills.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong></p>

<p>This is happening this weekend!!! Woo hoo, first thing off my list.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong></p>

<p>Slow and steady progress on this. I have been going to counselling and group therapy which has been helping. There are times when I slip but it&rsquo;s all a process and it won&rsquo;t always be linear.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong></p>

<p>This has been put on hold because I can&rsquo;t afford a P.O. box at the moment and my parents did not take to me using our home address to write literaly strangers. I can understand it.</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been regularly browsing who&rsquo;s been coming to my city and I don&rsquo;t know/like any of these artists/bands! I must be getting old.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong></p>

<p>Step 1. Make the list first.</p>

        <p>In my <a href="/blog/productive-distractions/">last post</a> I talked about making my boyfriend a scarf. I started it yesterday after showing him a couple of sample swatches. Out of all the scarves I showed him, he liked this one of a crochet <a href="http://www.fiberfluxblog.com/2013/01/free-crochet-patternoutline-ribbed-scarf.html">Outline Ribbed Scarf</a>. It&rsquo;s a rather simple scarf which is nice because it&rsquo;ll work up quickly. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll finish the scarf by his birthday.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures of the test swatches I made. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if he wanted the simple one stripe line like in the pattern so I did a couple of each.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-01.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-02.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-03.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p>When I sent the pictures to my boyfriend, he said he liked all of them. Which wasn&rsquo;t too helpful for me but at least he is not opposed it so far. Thankfully that section of the scarf doesn&rsquo;t come up for a while since it is worked horizontally.</p>

<p>Yesterday I just chained around 300 chains to start off the scarf and finished around two rows. I think I made it a little too long. My boyfriend is like 6&rsquo; and I made the scarf to be a couple more inches longer than that. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>The colours were chosen by my boyfriend himself. There&rsquo;s a game that we&rsquo;ve been playing together called Warframe and the colours he chose were the colours of one of his characters that we play. If you don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://warframe.com">Warframe</a> is a free-to-play online third person shooter. It&rsquo;s a good grind for those who like that kind of games. It reminds me a lot of Destiny!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I made the scarf too long and I had to frog all of my work. I managed to get back to where I was then the yarn tangled on me. Now I have untangle it&hellip; Such is life.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s my boyfriend&rsquo;s birthday coming up soon. I wanted to make him a knitted or a crocheted item because I need something to keep my hands busy. Plus aren&rsquo;t handmade things the sweetest thing you could get as a present??</p>

<p>On some level, I know he&rsquo;s a little picky about what kind of things he would like to wear. To avoid spending a ton of time working on something that he might not ever wear, I sent him a couple links to patterns of scarves and toques. I may have added a few slouchy beanies in the list of links because I think he would look really good in a slouchy beanie. Lo and behold, out of all the links I sent him, he liked the one non-slouchy beanie the most. I&rsquo;m not annoyed or anything but I am pretty amused. I love little moments like these.</p>

<p>To be honest, there are a ton of projects that I should be working on instead of thinking of this (to name a few, school assignments). However this is one of those things that I call a &ldquo;productive distraction.&rdquo; Writing this blog post is a productive distraction in itself.</p>

<p>I even had a productive distraction between thinking that I needed to write this post and actually starting to write it. I was originally planning to write only a short paragraph. Then I wondered if I should separate long form blog posts with my status-like blog posts. I turned to <a href="https://jack.baty.net">Jack Baty</a> for some inspiration. I really admire the web presence that Jack has and I like his gutso for mixing microblogging with regular blogging. The stream of consciousness approach is something that I really would like to emulate.</p>

<p>So I went to his website. Then I found myself on a couple of other websites. Now I have more things on my to-do list.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with Hugo lately. A couple of weeks ago, I exported my old Wordpress blog into Hugo. While I am happy with the results, it&rsquo;s taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I&rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.</p>

<p>So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site. A new GitHub repository.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see how Hugo + Github works out. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be here to stay (fingers crossed that Github Pages is still a thing until my deathbed).</p>
