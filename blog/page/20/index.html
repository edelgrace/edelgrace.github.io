        <p>New Years Resolutions are no longer the in thing. I recently turned 22 and it feels like my life is whizzing by now. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my goals but there are just too many that I have for one year and a couple that will go beyond 2017. So I figured a 25 before 25 would be appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in university since I was 17. Five years later and I&rsquo;m still here. While I do love the academic environment, I seriously can&rsquo;t wait to graduate. It&rsquo;s about time that I move on from school, even if it&rsquo;s a little scary.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents&rsquo; house</strong></p>

<p>It was only until recently that I resolved to move out and move out for good. When I was young, I happily accepted the fact that my parents would like to live with me in their retirement. Not anymore. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about myself and my boundaries towards my parents. I think it would be best for all of us for me to move out.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest steps towards responsible personal finance is maxing out my tax free savings account. As of 2016, my total contribution limit is around 30k. As the years go by, that will only increase. Hopefully I can do it.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open a RRSP account</strong></p>

<p>The only reason why I don&rsquo;t have one yet is because I don&rsquo;t have a permanent job yet. I simply don&rsquo;t make enough to warrant an RRSP. However, if I want to retire gracefully, an RRSP is essential.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong></p>

<p>Every graduates worst nightmare is to leave university only to land a part time job at the grocery store. I&rsquo;m hoping to land a job in networking or program development. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be right away, I can stand working retail for a couple of months.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong></p>

<p>Every year I want to read at least 50 books. I&rsquo;m an avid reader. This year I managed to make it work so I&rsquo;m hoping I can continue to make it work for the next couple of years.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong></p>

<p>One of my friends joke that I&rsquo;ve been playing the first installation of Dragon Age for years. So far I&rsquo;ve clocked around 100 hours and I&rsquo;m definitely nowhere near done it yet. It&rsquo;s those side quests that sidetrack me, I swear.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong></p>

<p>A couple of years ago I started working on a TCG but it fell through the cracks. I&rsquo;d love to take up that project again and finish it. I love TCGs so it would be a fun endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday I started making a small Pomodoro app. I&rsquo;m making decent progress but it&rsquo;s nowhere near polished. It would be great to finish it.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong></p>

<p>Another project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for a while. I keep starting and restarting it. I don&rsquo;t want to rely on GoodReads and I fancy the idea of having a local copy of the books I&rsquo;ve read.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver&rsquo;s license</strong></p>

<p>22 and without a license. I feel like a burden asking my friends for rides everywhere. I do like walking around everywhere because I desperately need the exercise. However, the city I live in is not really commuter friendly so a car would make things extremely easier.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong></p>

<p>Many of my friends are alike in that we are all tech geeks. From gaming to building PCs to programming, you name it. I think it would be nice to make friends who aren&rsquo;t necessarily into the whole tech thing. Different perspectives is essential for a well-rounded world view. Plus, I&rsquo;d like to be introduced into something that isn&rsquo;t, well, tech.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong></p>

<p>I envy those who can lift and run and be athletic. I&rsquo;d really love to lose some weight, cut down on the body fat, and not be struggling for air after walking three flights of stairs.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong></p>

<p>My dentist always begs me to floss but no matter how many horror stories she gives me, I just don&rsquo;t do it. I know I should. I really have to.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m dehydrated <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. I&rsquo;m convinced that I have years shaved off my life purely due to the fact that I do not drink enough water. I don&rsquo;t notice my thirst cues very well until my head is throbbing, my lips a cracked, and my throat is parched. Dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong></p>

<p>If I want to move out, I should probably learn how to cook. And not just making sandwiches. I&rsquo;d love to be able to make pasta.</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled to another country without family once but it was a school field trip. I would love to go to Japan but that&rsquo;s expensive. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just cross the border down south again?</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong></p>

<p>I started the Konmari process but have yet to progress past my books. It would be beneficial to accomplish this before I move out. Less stuff to pack!</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong></p>

<p>I had my first alcoholic beverage this year. I&rsquo;ve never been black out drunk before and I think there should be a first time for everything. Hopefully I don&rsquo;t spiral from there.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through my CCNA course so getting my CCNA is totally on the horizon.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong></p>

<p>Zoo Lights is a local festival that happens every winter. I&rsquo;ve never gone before because my parents have been paranoid about my being out in the cold at night. I think it would make for a good future date.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong></p>

<p>Oof, it got heavy suddenly. I&rsquo;ve been struggling with depression for a couple of years now. I think I&rsquo;ve identified some sources and I&rsquo;d like to come up with a plan to combat it.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong></p>

<p>I have a pen pal whom I haven&rsquo;t written to in months. Well, I sent him a quick Christmas card but that doesn&rsquo;t count in my opinion. I&rsquo;d love to pick up the pen again as I do miss his correspondences!</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been to a concert since my very first concert (My Chemical Romance, RIP). I have a couple of bands and artists that I&rsquo;d love to see live but it&rsquo;s just a matter of if they come to Calgary! But it would totally be cool to take a road trip outside of the city to watch some live music.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong></p>

<p>There are too many movies that I have not seen before. Just to name a few: V for Vendetta, Clueless, Pulp Fiction, Schindler&rsquo;s List, Singing in the Rain, Princess Mononoke, Gone Girl, Akira, The Princess Bride&#8230;</p>

        <h4>Dec 19, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/life/2017-reading-resolutions/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>This year I told myself I would read at least 25 books. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot but when you consider my reading history the past couple of years, that&rsquo;s a big number.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2015</strong>: 7 books + 3 graphic novels = 10 books</li>
<li><strong>2014</strong>: 19 books + 20 graphic novels = 39 books</li>
<li><strong>2013</strong>: 40 books + 30 graphic novels = 74 books</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong>: 18 books</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, not great numbers. Each year I have been reading less and less. 2013 was a weird anomaly. So far this year of 2016 (there&rsquo;s still like ten days left in the year&#8230;) I only managed to read 38 books, not including graphic novels. In total I&rsquo;ve read about 84 books. So that&rsquo;s still like 46 graphic novels that I&rsquo;ve read. I really wanted my novel to graphic novel ratio to be greater than or equal to one. However, I still met my goal of 25 books. So kudos to me!</p>

<p>This year I decided to opt for minimalism and not sign up for any reading challenges. To me, the most important thing is going through my to read list. If I even manage to make a small dent in the list, I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>

<p><strong>Here are my 2017 reading resoltuions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Read a total of 60 books.</li>
<li>Read at least 30 non-graphic novels.</li>
<li>Read more novels than graphic novels.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take out any books from the library that are not in my to read list.</li>
<li>Read at least half of the books on my 25 books to read in 2017 list</li>
</ul>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I recently made a trip to the library. Here&rsquo;s what I managed to grab.</p>

<p><strong>Buried in Books: A Reader&rsquo;s Anthology by Julie Rugg</strong><br />
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don&rsquo;t recall exactly why they&rsquo;re on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me. I like reading about reading, a little ironic but it&rsquo;s interesting to see how others view reading.</p>

<p><strong>Madame Tussaud by Michelle Moran</strong><br />
Yet another unknown. I think this is due to the fact that it is historical fiction involving royalty during the French Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>The Midwich Cuckoos by Jogn Wyndham</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve been trying to get into science fiction. I adored the sci-fi and fantasy genres when I was younger. I don&rsquo;t quite know what happened to my preferences. I think I got all sappy and romantic but there&rsquo;s no reason why science fiction can&rsquo;t be romantic!</p>

<p><strong>Something New by Lucy Kinsley</strong><br />
Kinsley&rsquo;s previous works were pretty good and I think her drawings are cute and quirky. I love the autobiographical element.</p>

<p><strong>Two Kisses for Maddy by Matthew Logelin</strong><br />
I always try to get some non-fiction into my library trips. My go to is always memoirs. I have yet to read a memoir involving children. Good luck. I do not predict dry eyes for this one.</p>

<p><strong>You Can Act on Camera by D.W. Brown</strong><br />
This one wasn&rsquo;t on any list but I justified it because it was such a slim volume. Seems interesting. I think the book title is lying but we&rsquo;ll see how Brown defends his claim.</p>

        <h4>Dec 7, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/life/i-just-culled-my-book-wish-list/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

            </ul>
        </div>

        

<p>On Goodreads, my &ldquo;want-to-own&rdquo; shelf used to have 127 books in it. Now it has five.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been bit by the konmari bug. I&rsquo;ve konmari&rsquo;d my wardrobe and my books so far. I&rsquo;m still stuck on the books. I decided it would be fitting to prevent my book collection from growing back to it&rsquo;s ridiculous size and get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t spark joy on my book wish list.</p>

<h3 id="books-that-made-the-cut">Books that made the cut</h3>

<p><strong>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle</strong><br />
I read this book a couple of years ago. Although it&rsquo;s aimed at a younger audience, I really enjoyed this story. After reading it, I went to watch the animated movie as well. A small part of me has always been fascinated by unicorns and horses (I blame Sailor Moon as the source of that).</p>

<p><strong>The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde</strong><br />
To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much of this book but I do remember being in awe of Wilde&rsquo;s writing. I remember the last few pages more than anything. It was not exactly terrifying but it was a bit&#8230; Grotesque? I mostly want this book so I can re-read it.</p>

<p><strong>The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov</strong><br />
A couple of years ago I took a Russian Literature course and had to do a group presentation on this book. This book is probably one of the very few that I actually read front to back for a class. Actually, I read all the required books in this course. That was a first for me. Bulgakov&rsquo;s imagination is borderline execessive with this work but I do like his alternative history spin on Jesus&rsquo; life.</p>

<p><strong>The Glass Menagerie by Tenesee Williams</strong><br />
Marie Kondo&rsquo;s motto is to get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t spark joy. This play is incredibly sad but in a way, it also sparks joy for me. I find it to be such a heartbreakingly simple story that I can&rsquo;t help but appreciate it.</p>

<p><strong>Sabriel by Garth Nix</strong><br />
When I was younger, I was totally absorbed in fantasy. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, I hardly ever read any of the fantasy genre anymore. Sabriel really touched something in me. I got sucked into the world. One of my childhood friends recently (as in, like a couple of weeks ago) told me that I reminded her of Sabriel. She was the one who recommended this book to me way back when. That&rsquo;s another thing that I appreciate about this book.</p>

<h3 id="books-that-almost-made-the-cut">Books that almost made the cut</h3>

<p><strong>Paradise Kiss series by Ai Yazawa</strong><br />
Okay, I&rsquo;m still on the fence about this one. I love this series and I love Ai Yazawa&rsquo;s work. Paradise Kiss is one of those series that sat with me for a while. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to read this one over again and see how I feel about it. The reason why I&rsquo;m not sure is because I feel like there&rsquo;s something unsettling about it. It&rsquo;s a little similar to how I feel about <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. It&rsquo;s incredibly bittersweet. There are some scenes that I remember that actually make me feel a pang in my chest. I&rsquo;m tearing up right now thinking about it!</p>

<p><strong>A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray</strong><br />
The Gemma Doyle series is pretty okay but damn, the covers are gorgeous (yes, I&rsquo;m a little shallow). I love the gothic setting and historical aspect of it but unfortunately, it was lacking in content a little. It would be nice to have it sit on my shelf and look pretty but I would never pick it up and read it again.</p>

        <p>I recently resolved not to take out any library books unless they were on my to read list. Here&rsquo;s what I took out on my latest trip to the library!</p>

<p><strong>Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson</strong><br />
I don&rsquo;t remember why or how this book got onto my to read list but I know that it&rsquo;s been on the list for quite a while. I was glad to see the book sitting on the shelf since I&rsquo;ve been looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Sputnik Sweetheart by Haruki Murakami</strong><br />
Pretty much all of Murakami&rsquo;s books are on my to read list. <em>Sputnik Sweetheart</em> is no exception. Usually there are three things I always go check when I go to the library: the manga section, Jodi Picoult, and Haruki Murakami. Murakami is pretty popular so I was lucky I got a hold on this novel.</p>

<p><strong>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bronte by Syrie James</strong><br />
I adore the Bronte family and pretty much everything Bronte related, non-fiction or fiction, is on my to read list.</p>
