        <p>Last week I wanted to draw a tree. The thought came to me while my SO and I were eating lunch at the Vietnamese restaurant. Behind him there was a large plastic palm tree and that was when I suggested trees. We ended up finding a picture of snowy winter trees on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pics">/r/pics</a>.</p>

<p>What was the one time you thought the movie was better than the book? Submitted by Tomi @ <a href="http://www.abgtl.co.uk/">A Bookworm&rsquo;s Guide to Life</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, this is a really tough one. I am sure I have watched plenty of book movies but I haven&rsquo;t always read the book counterpart. Honestly, the only thing that comes to my mind is probably the <em>Harry Potter</em> series or maybe the first <em>Charlotte&rsquo;s Web</em> movie. I think I probably need to read more books that were made into movies&#8230;</p>

<p>There are a whole bunch on my list though!The obvious ones like <em>Jurassic Park</em> and <em>Forrest Gump</em> have been on my to read lists for forever.</p>

        <p><strong>Spoilers, beware.</strong></p>

<p>I am not a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan. I watched the first trilogy very quickly, bits and pieces of the second trilogy, and <em>The Force Awakens</em>. Honestly, most of what I know about <em>Star Wars</em> is from the Lego video games and <em>Family Guy</em>. However, my lack of knowledge of the franchise didn&rsquo;t stop me from going to the theaters and watching the latest installment.</p>

<p>When I first watched the <em>Rogue One</em> trailer, I was left wanting for a little more. There were characters I haven&rsquo;t seen before and it revealed little about the plot. I avoided any spoilers about the movie, somehow, so I truly was going into it with zero expectations. Overall, I enjoyed it.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The IMAX Experience</strong>
</p>

<p>Because we missed the showing we originally planned to see and I had to get home at a certain time, I picked the next showing which was IMAX. It didn&rsquo;t really click with me that it was IMAX until it was five minutes before the movie started and I looked down at my ticket wondering why there wasn&rsquo;t a theater number on it. Turns out, the theater number was &ldquo;IMAX.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t have an eye for special effects or resolution or whatever film buffs look for in terms of aesthetic quality. But right off the bat I realized that the movie was definitely not made to be 3D. There wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot of depth and quite honestly, I forgot I was watching a supposedly 3D movie. In my opinion, skip the IMAX, you&rsquo;re probably not missing much.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The CGI</strong>
</p>

<p>Okay, I wasn&rsquo;t completely spoiler free going into this movie. I had read somewhere on Reddit mentioning Princess Leia being recreated with CGI and not recasted. Thankfully I didn&rsquo;t remember that comment until the scene where Leia appears. My first thought was, &ldquo;Woah, that&rsquo;s CGI?&rdquo; I honestly think they did a great job.</p>

<p>It also wasn&rsquo;t until I went on Reddit did I realize Tarkin was done in CGI as well. Not once did I get an uncanny valley vibe from that character. Now that I&rsquo;m looking at screenshots after the fact, he does look significantly more cartoony. Still, it looks pretty impressive. Maybe my favourable opinion is due to the 3D masking some of the obvious CGI giveaways.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The Story</strong>
</p>

<p>Like I said before, I had no idea what to expect going into the movie when it came to the plot. Since I&rsquo;m not too familiar to the universe, it took me a while to grasp what exactly what was happening but I got the jist of it.</p>

<p>There were some cheesy moments, such as when Jyn goes to the Alliance with her father&rsquo;s message and nothing comes out of it but wait, some people totally believe her and will go against their organization to help her! I get that it was necessary but it was a tad predictable.</p>

<p>The ending kinda left me in shock. When K-2 was killed my jaw hung open slightly. Then Donnie Yen died (I really don&rsquo;t know the characters names very well) and I was getting a bit teary eyed. Then the big dude who follows Donnie Yen everywhere exploded. The deaths never stopped coming!</p>

<p>But what surprised me the most was the bittersweet ending. The mission is complete but many lives were sacrificed. One of the Rebel councillors implied that it would have been a suicide mission and it was. The last scene reminded me of the end of <em>2012</em>, of the two people holding onto each other in the incoming tidal wave. Honestly, it was a beautiful scene.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The Characters</strong>
</p>

<p>K-2 was a very refreshing character and I enjoyed his comedic relief. And I think that&rsquo;s the only character in the entire movie that made a lasting impression on me.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire movie I was trying to determine Cassian&rsquo;s accent. French? Spanish? I still don&rsquo;t know. Jyn was a little bit of a disappointment but I was thrilled at a female lead, even if Jyn felt extremelt flat. Donnie Yen&rsquo;s character was pretty badass and I enjoyed his dynamic with his big sidekick. Tarkin was wonderfully creepy and fit the bill for a stereotypical villain but that&rsquo;s all he was.</p>

<p>In short, nothing spectacular about the characters.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The Summary</strong>
</p>

<p>It was a good movie. I don&rsquo;t have much to complain about other than the flat characters that I felt little attachment to. Was it worth like $20 for the IMAX? Nope. But I think most people are pretty pleased with the movie and so am I.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I recently finished reading <em>Mary and The Wrongs of Woman</em> by Mary Wollstonecraft. I received this book from a friend of my mothers. I actually received multiple books from my mother&rsquo;s friend, many of them classics such as <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Bronte, <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen, <em>Frankenstein</em> by Mary Shelly (who is, by the way, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft), etc. I managed to find many books that I enjoyed from her gift.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am mixed about this book. It is essentially two separate stories in one: <em>Mary</em> and <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em>. There are many similarities between the two of them. Both feature a leading female character: Mary in <em>Mary</em> and Maria in <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em>. As you may notice, their names are basically the same since Mary is the English version of Maria. Both are woman who lament the married life. They had married the wrong person, both arranged marriages, and grieve their loss of freedom. Their hearts are captured by a men named Henry. There is much suffering their lives. The similarities go on and on.</p>

<p>At the time this was written, women wanting to be independent must have been a radical idea. Some might say this theme of female independence is extremely feminist. The pains Maria goes to attempt to get a divorce are great and lengthy. Mary avoids to meet her husband for as long she can. In Wollstonecrafts words, wives are the property of men who can do nothing but sit silently and become a slave to their husbands. I strongly felt for Wollstonecraft, as these works must have been incredibly autobiographical.</p>

<p>While I applaud the sentiment behind them, I am not sure if I liked this book much. The exposition can get long and tedious. The Henry in <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em> goes into a lengthy monologue about his history that goes on for four pages although he prefaced this monologue by saying he did not want to talk too much about himself. The Mary&rsquo;s inner dialogue can get extremely tiring and too lavish in words for me to fully comprehend their meaning.</p>

<p>However, this book did stir my emotions and my eyes teared up a bit at points. I am so grateful to live in a world where a woman has more freedom. It&rsquo;s sad this isn&rsquo;t universal across the entire world, yet, but I would say progress is there. As someone who is also apprehensive of tying myself down and getting married, I truly did empathize with these characters. Being with someone for (supposedly) the rest of my life is a great decision that really should not be taken lightly. Even now, it&rsquo;s expected for everyone to go down this path but for those who don&rsquo;t wish for it, it should never be forced upon them.</p>

<p>So, would I recommend this book? I&rsquo;m not sure. I don&rsquo;t think I would actively go out of my way to do so but I wouldn&rsquo;t discourage anyone from reading it. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a shot. Would I keep this book? Sadly, no. This book is going into my donation pile.</p>

        <p><strong>The Game</strong></p>

<p>Take turns to ice an object or living being onto a cookie. Everyone guesses what that person iced onto the cookie. There are no winners, just a bunch of people having fun and joking around about their lack of (or possession of) artistic ability.</p>

<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>

<p>Over the holidays I was baking brownies and cookies with my cousins. The brownies had left over frosting so we decided to ice the cookies with cool designs. I attempted to ice a snowflake onto my cookie and my cousin asked me incredulously what the heck was I doing. When I told him that I was frosting a snowflake, he laughed and wanted to try to ice something as well. It quickly turned into a game where we tried to guess what each other made.</p>

<p>The challenge was the fact that the cookies melted the frosting, the frosting was runny, and we weren&rsquo;t professional cookie decorators. Nevertheless, it was a fun little baking session and there was a lot of laughs!</figure></p>

<p><strong>Our Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we came up with. In case you can&rsquo;t figure it out, here&rsquo;s a legend (left to right, top to bottom): test (AKA nothing), test, snowflake, wreath, baby Jesus, present, candles, Santa hat, manger, sleigh, Christmas tree, bell, glass of milk, candy cane, holly, Santa, snowman, star, angel, elf, stocking, poinsettia, fireplace, cookies.<figure></p>
