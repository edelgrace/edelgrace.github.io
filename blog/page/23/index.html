        <p>I&rsquo;m in a weird place where I&rsquo;m reading a lot but I&rsquo;m unsure if I&rsquo;m feeling depressed because I&rsquo;m reading too much or I&rsquo;m reading too much because I&rsquo;m feeling depressed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought of books as an escape. That sounds a little too negative but I enjoy experiencing a story that I would probably never experience myself. Lately I&rsquo;ve gravitated to historical fiction because it&rsquo;s just so different and unknown territory. But sometimes when I finish a book, I feel a little bit sad. Sometimes, I envy the characters for their exciting lives and feel worse about my own life.</p>

<p>At the same time, I read because my own life is boring. I&rsquo;m not sure how to feel.</p>

<p>What is your favorite Valentine&rsquo;s Day read? Submitted by Kristin @ <a href="http://luktenavtrykksverte.blogspot.no/">Lukten av Trykksverte</a></p>

<p>Is it okay for me to say that I don&rsquo;t have any&#8230;? I don&rsquo;t really read anything specifically for Valentine&rsquo;s Day. I also don&rsquo;t recall any Valentine&rsquo;s Day themed books. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I <em>love</em> a good romance novel, but I&rsquo;m not sure I can think of one appropriate for a special day like Valentine&rsquo;s Day. I think my tastes a bit too tragic for that, haha!</p>

        <p>In an attempt to do more things in my free time, I decided to join a gym. My original plan was to go to my university gym however since I am on co-op, I no longer have the discounted membership included in my tuition. Instead, I opted for my local Fit4Less. It is an extremely more convenient location, significantly cheaper, and a good &ldquo;introductory&rdquo; gym for those who are just starting out. An added bonus was having a friend who had a membership at the same gym so I had a gym buddy!</p>

<p>Today was my first day working out with him. He was a little late so I walked on a treadmill for around fifteen minutes. Once he arrived, we got on another cardio machine. I don&rsquo;t really know the name but we spent a good 30 minutes there talking about how life was going. I got a little out of breath but not really so maybe we weren&rsquo;t doing it right.</p>

<p>Afterwards we went on the lateral row machine. I could only do three sets of ten with 50lbs. A little concerning but I&rsquo;m really weak and I guess you gotta start somewhere!</p>

<p>It was just a quick session because it was getting late and the roads were pretty bad (half the office was working from home today). My mom was worried so we went home. It was a good solid hour spent there and we got to use the massage chairs at the end.</p>

<p>Hopefully we continue going!</p>

        <p>I decided to post a work in progress. My SO picked this week&rsquo;s picture and it was of a very pretty warrior girl. I started it and I really like how the face turned out. I quickly sketched out the rest of the body and I am already pretty proud of it. Compared to the original, my version looks a little less feminine. I just can&rsquo;t draw lips right from the side. Also, her eyebrows are so &ldquo;on fleek&rdquo; that I don&rsquo;t dare to change them. So much character in those eyebrows.</p>

        <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling pretty down in the dumps. Ever since I started working, I realized that I have a lot of free time that I don&rsquo;t know what to do with. I even started to (I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m saying this) miss having homework. Okay, I actually have a lot of projects that I want to get working on but I also want to be a little more social.</p>

<p>My SO had been talking about his ventures in bouldering and going out with his friends. I started to feel a little envious. Truthfully, I only have one friend outside of my SO and our schedules are so out of sync that I can only see her a couple times a year. So my SO and I ended up looking for hobbies that I could get into, but also with a social aspect.</p>

<p>I entertained the idea of joining a club on campus but since my work is pretty far from campus and I also live far from campus, I decided it might now be the best idea. I did, however, find a couple of clubs that I would like to join for when I go back to school.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we found a couple of groups on&nbsp;<a href="http://meetup.com/" style="font-size: 16px;">Meetup.com</a>. There were a lot that I had to sift through. Some of them I was interested in but the group was dead. Others were so popular that their events required wait lists. I ultimately narrowed them done to a couple of groups that I would like to try out.</p>

<p><strong>Board Games for Women</strong></p>

<p>I always wanted to get into board games and make more female friends. Being in a male dominated major, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of opportunities to meet other women.</p>

<p><strong>Arts and Crafts</strong></p>

<p>When I was younger, I was a very crafty person. One of my elementary teachers once noted that I was &ldquo;always making something.&rdquo; Not much has changed except for the fact that my creative pursuits are now digital. I would love to get in touch with the more physical side of creating things again.</p>

<p><strong>Big Data Programming</strong></p>

<p>I find the concept of big data to be incredibly interesting. I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of programming as of late but it would be a great idea to get involved. Their meetups are a little sporadic but hopefully they have an event soon.</p>
