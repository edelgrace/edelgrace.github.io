        <p>Recently, the Prime Minister stopped by our city to hold a quick Q &amp; A with the general public. He spoke at my university and as such, university students had the first chance to get early admission to the event. I had left work a little bit early to get to the university. I grabbed a Carl&rsquo;s Jr burger (which greatly upset my stomach) and ate in the Computer Science club room watching some people play fighting games and Magic. Closer to the event starting, my SO and I walked over to the gym where the Q &amp; A was being held. The line was pretty long and my SO decided he didn&rsquo;t want to wait and go to class instead. I stayed in the line.</p>

<p>The wait was pretty long. The doors were to open at 6:00PM for people with early admission and 6:30PM for the rest of the public. The event was rumored to start at 7:00PM but wasn&rsquo;t confirmed. I got a seat around 6:30PM and sat there until past 8:00PM waiting for the Prime Minister to appear. There was a lot of people there, mainly university students but there were a lot of other different people there too. Even within the university students, there was a lot of diversity. The guy I was waiting beside in the line was a European dude with a thick French accent and on my other side was an Indian dude and his white friend chatting up a storm about parties and occasionally topics they wanted to hear at the event.</p>

<p>I did not really go to the event with a plan. There wasn&rsquo;t much that I was expecting but I couldn&rsquo;t turn down seeing the Prime Minister in the flesh and possibly learn a little more about what exactly he was doing for our country. I had a sneaking suspicion that the whole thing was just a PR stunt bu considering the current political climate of where I live, the conversations were bound to be interesting.</p>

<p>By the time Trudeau came out, the reaction was mixed. I heard a lot of booing and a lot of cheering. I was struck immediately with how much of a regular person he looked like. He was dressed pretty casually with a button down shirt and jeans. I&rsquo;m a little ashamed for thinking this but it was the first time I thought, &ldquo;Wow, now I can understand why people think Trudeau is handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Enough about that my shallow thoughts (fun fact, when the event was being aired online, people could hear girls talking in the background about how good Trudeau&rsquo;s hair was).</p>

<p>The first &ldquo;question&rdquo; was pretty dry. A woman in the front told her life story as a potential Olympic athlete who later became disabled. She asked Trudeau to listen to her proposal for ways to assist those with disabilities. A worthy cause and a brave woman but a boring question that didn&rsquo;t provide a lot for Trudeau to respond to.</p>

<p>Later on in the night, a girl to the side identified herself as a feminist. This piqued my interest as I think of myself as a feminist as well. I anticipated a question about the transgender washroom debate or the wage gap but instead she asked for Trudeau&rsquo;s opinion on Trump&rsquo;s comments against women. I was immediately disappointed. Of all the questions to ask the Prime Minister (and not limited to feminism), this had to be asked?</p>

<p>The next question that stood out in my mind was no better. One person pointed out that there was no incentive to get higher education and enter a high paying field if they were swamped in debt due to schooling and had to pay higher taxes on top of that. This was another disappointing question. If you&rsquo;re making a lot of money, your debt will get paid off extremely quickly. In Canada, you do not pay a single percentage of your entire income. There are different tax brackets and for the first tax bracket, you are taxed a certain percentage. If you pass that first tax bracket, anything else you make additionally is taxed at a different percentage. Yes, you do pay more taxes but you still come out with more money in the end than if you weren&rsquo;t in a high paying profession.</p>

<p>The rest of the questions were not as hard hitting as I thought they would be and I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with many of Trudeau&rsquo;s answers. Overall, I feel like he gave some good examples of how he is improving the country. However, those examples never really seemed to answer the question that was being asked. The only direct answer he gave was when he was asked about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict (FYI, he believes in a two start solution). At times, he did &ldquo;um&rdquo; and &ldquo;uh&rdquo;-d his way through some of the questions.</p>

<p>He got some flack from a pro-oil sands group near the end. They were angry at the idea of oil sands being phased out. I get their fear. I understand their reliance on the oil sands. I do not agree that the oil sands are the end all be all that this province has. Obviously, this pushed buttons with the Prime Minister. He had already approved oil pipelines that would help out the oil sands industry and was still being accused of being anti-oil and anti-Albertan. He became extremely passionate with his answer and the crowd did not stop cheering and booing throughout his entire monologue.</p>

<p>Honestly, it was a bit of spectacle but I don&rsquo;t regret going. I think this sort of dialogue is important and it&rsquo;s good for people to have a chance to voice their opinions and concerns. Obviously, some people could have been a tad more respectful (there were a couple of hecklers who shouted over everyone and it was hard to understand what people with microphones were saying) and some people felt like their questions weren&rsquo;t fully answered (I don&rsquo;t think they were either). It&rsquo;s not perfect but hopefully Trudeau notes the things that are being said to him during this campaign.</p>

<p>The only thing I regret is not bringing my water bottle with me. I was thirsty for a good straight four hours.</p>

        <p>Last week&rsquo;s theme was fantasy. The original picture was a lot more ethereal and pretty. I had to redraw this one because I messed up the background. The background was definitely the hardest part because the original picture relied heavily on colour.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of weeks since 2017 has started. I started off the new year with some tweaks to my bullet journal. 2016 wasn&rsquo;t the best year for using my bullet journal. I used it a lot when I was in school but not so much when I was working. I&rsquo;m aiming to be more productive outside of work this year though! In light of my new goal, I decided it was best to revamp my bullet journal. This year&rsquo;s theme is work-life balance. One of my friends jokingly said, &ldquo;It seems like you never have any fun.&rdquo; Thus, I resolve to have more fun!</p>

<p><strong>Monthly Habit Trackers</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never stuck to a habit tracker in full before. This year I aimed to make them as minimal as possible. No rulers were used in making these. It took about half an hour to do all twelve months. I condensed the monthly log because I really don&rsquo;t have that many events, usually.</p>

<p><strong>Monthly Health Trackers</strong></p>

<p>On the other side of the monthly habit trackers are the monthly health trackers. This mostly focuses on physical health with a side of mental health too. I&rsquo;m trying to track my calories, steps I&rsquo;ve taken, weight, and my mood each day.</p>

<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Since I had a couple of weeks to settle into my bullet journal, I can safely say that I&rsquo;m still pretty bad at using my bullet journal everyday. Honestly, this is definitely a mental health thing. When I find myself in a depressive slump, I do not feel like doing anything. You can tell when my mind became a little clouded and it wasn&rsquo;t until a couple of days ago that I finally got out of it. Hopefully, February will fare better.</p>

Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many books have you statted but just couldn&rsquo;t finish? Submitted by Elizabeth @ <a href="http://www.abgtl.co.uk/">Silver&rsquo;s Reviews</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How <strong>many</strong>? As in, a specific number? Too many to count. Actually, that&rsquo;s not accurate. I don&rsquo;t really know the answer to that question. There have been a lot of books that I gave up on. The most recent book was <em>The Rebel</em> by Albert Camus, however I am determined to finish it. A couple of Amy Tan books were hard for me to complete. <em>Cryptonomicon</em> is another one that I&rsquo;ve started and restarted to read over and over again. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot&#8230; No way I could list (or count) them all!</p>

        <h4>Jan 26, 2017 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/im-slowly-losing-my-hair/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>One morning after we woke up, my SO wiped the bed and exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much of your hair!&rdquo; We both laughed it off but I felt a sense of dread. I&rsquo;m no stranger to hair loss. For years now I&rsquo;ve notice more hair in the shower, on my pillow, on the floor, on my laptop, etc. When I go to my doctor every year, he reassures me it&rsquo;s normal and gets me to do bloodwork that always comes back clean.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just my genetics at play for my dad is balding and my mom&rsquo;s hair is pretty thin (due to pulling it out, however). Or maybe it&rsquo;s because I recently restricting my calories again. Or because I started working a 9 to 5 job and I am actually more stressed than I feel.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this post, my mom commented on the thinning of the top of my head. Tears formed in my eyes almost immediately.</p>

<p>The thought of losing my hair is scary. I&rsquo;m not conventially attractive and my hair is definitely not my best point, but it isn&rsquo;t a negative. It is pretty thick but not soft and silky. Still, I get choked up thinking about parting ways with my hair.</p>

<p>As a woman, it&rsquo;s particularly hard. For men, balding is not unheard of. Of course, that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s not as hard for men and I&rsquo;m sure for people whose gender lies outside of the binary, it&rsquo;s still a struggle. But there is so much importance put on a woman&rsquo;s hair. It&rsquo;s rare for people to think about hair loss in women and it&rsquo;s a shock when people see it.</p>

<p>However, there is no shortage of women who are bald (or have closely cropped hair) or who have had their stints with baldness. Amber Rose, Willow Smith, Sinead Connor, Natalie Portman, etc. With the whole feminist movement, more and more women are jumping at the chance to deviate from gender norms.</p>

<p>At my brother&rsquo;s graduation last year, a very sweet and cute girl walked the stage bald. She was undergoing chemo therapy which is a bit different but she was so confident and radiated beauty. She was also Filipino, like me, and I had never seen a bald Filipino girl before. And she rocked it!</p>

<p>So maybe being bald wouldn&rsquo;t be a life changer.</p>

<p>My hairline is receeding slowly and the bald spot on the top of my head is not so large. Maybe I still start using Rogaine or Nizoral. We&rsquo;ll see how well that goes.</p>

<p>If it gets particularly bad, I think I will just shave it all off. I admit, I&rsquo;m a bit excited at the prospect of wearing wigs. Maybe I could go blonde, or wear a cute style that my hair never agreed with, or have crazy coloured wigs.</p>

<p>Or I could forego the wigs entirely and just start wearing makeup. Makeup is another thing I haven&rsquo;t been able to experiment (because I&rsquo;m broke and always rushing in the morning). Bald women with great make up are awesome (Becky from Buzzfeed comes to mind).</p>

<p>Either way, it&rsquo;ll be an adventure.</p>
