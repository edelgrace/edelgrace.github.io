<blockquote>
<p>Is everyday a reading day for you? Submitted by Elizabeth @ <a href="â€‹http://silversolara.blogspot.com/">Silver&rsquo;s Reviews</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make it a habit of reading everyday. Realistically though, I only really read during the work week. Those days I specifically block out times for myself dedicated for reading: on the way to and from work (since I take public transportation). One day I&rsquo;d like to read everyday, but I still have a way to go.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s almost 3:00PM. So far today, I have done the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Went to church</li>
<li>Did my laundry</li>
<li>Cooked and ate lunch</li>
<li>Worked out for half an hour</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the rest of chapter 1 in my CCNA3 course</li>
<li>Go through my to-do list in my bullet journal</li>
<li>Update my monthly trackers in my bullet journal</li>
<li>Work a little bit on my pomodoro app</li>
<li>Reply to my pen pal</li>
</ul>

<p>So much to do, so little time!</p>

        <p>Yesterday I went out with my SO for Vietnamese food. There&rsquo;s a decently sized restaurant called <em>Bow River Vietnamese Restaurant</em> that&rsquo;s close by his house. I regret not taking pictures but their deep fried wontons were delicious. It had a good amount of meat and perfect crunchy crust. The sauce they provided it with was good as well.</p>

<p>For myself, I ordered a regular beef noodle soup. In the soup was tripe, brisket, and beef balls in it. The broth was great. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of tripe so I left it in the bowl. The bowl itself was pretty big, I can&rsquo;t believe I almost finished everything. I feel bad for wasting food but there&rsquo;s just so much that they give! For drinks, I got an orange slush. Orange is my favourite drink flavour of all time and I was not disappointed. It tasted like the artificial orange flavour but any kind of orange is okay with me.</p>

<p>The side they have are interesting, bean sprouts and a sprig of mint. SO ate most of the bean sprouts and I regret not eating more of the mint. It was tasty, for a leaf. Weird to think about how mints are essentially just plants.</p>

<p>While at his house, we watched a couple episodes of <em>Westworld</em>. If you haven&rsquo;t heard yet, it&rsquo;s a TV series about a highly advanced them park that features extremely advanced and realistic AIs that roam around interacting with the humans and attending their every needs (or should I say, wants). We&rsquo;re only at the fourth episode right now. I&rsquo;m intrigued with it although it&rsquo;s hard for me to figure what is really happening at any point in time. When I expressed my confusing, my SO tried to give me a hint that didn&rsquo;t reveal any spoilers (disclaimer, skip the rest of the paragraph if you&rsquo;re sensitive to spoilers). He told me that there are three distinct timelines in the story. This may have confused me further. I did notice the three different plots: rich old man&rsquo;s attempt to discover the secrets of the park, William on his first adventures in the park, Maeve&rsquo;s discovery that things aren&rsquo;t not what it seems in the park. I&rsquo;m having trouble trying to place when each of these plots happen relative to each other. All the other events that happen in the series, I have trouble placing what happens where.</p>

<p>So far though, I enjoy the series. I doubted the fact that is was a Western (I&rsquo;m not a really a fan of Westerns) but I was pleased when it was much more than a Western. The sci-fi element is always present in the story and you&rsquo;re always aware that everything is not &ldquo;real.&rdquo; I accidentally spoiled myself looking up pictures of Thandie Newton (she is superb, I loved her in <em>Pursuit of Happyness</em>) but it only fueled my anticipation to go through the rest of the series. My SO had already watched the series and is going through watching it again with me (bless). He wasn&rsquo;t entirely enamored with the series but I guess he likes it enough to go through a second watching.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I helped him move desks. There&rsquo;s a desk in the living room that he wanted to transfer into his little &ldquo;office&rdquo; room. His previous desk was a little small and the desk he moved in was much larger and provided more space. The surface area is definitely greater but sitting two people at that desk gets a bit cramped. I do like seeing his desk somewhat tidier though, although it is still kinda dusty.</p>

<p>After that I walked to Safeway to get some Starbucks. I received a gift card from one of my relatives. I love Starbucks. I only like the sugary drinks and I don&rsquo;t like to drink my coffee black. This time I ordered a grande caramel machiatto. It was sweet enough for me, although all the caramel drizzle may have been a bit overkill. But I enjoyed drinking it. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time I drank it but the first time in a while. I may buy it again, sometimes I have not encountered a drink yet to replace my ultimate favourite: white chocolate mocha.</p>

<p>Anyway, once I got home, I ate dinner and wrote up this blog post! It&rsquo;s now almost 8:30PM. I think I will spend the rest of the day studying for CCNA. Hopefully I can finish the rest of the chapter.</p>

        <h4>Jan 7, 2017 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/phew-i-moved-my-fanlistings/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
        
        <div class="tags">
            <ul>
              
              <li><a href="/categories/websites">Websites</a></li>            
              
  
              
              <li><a href="/tags/fanlistings">#fanlistings</a></li>
              
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Fanlistings are basically the early 2000&rsquo;s version of Facebook pages. I <a href="http://fan.edelgrace.me">own a bunch of them</a>, mostly of songs or video game characters. Honestly, the whole fanlisting thing has been going down in popularity as the years go by. It&rsquo;s a bit sad. Fanlistings come and go a lot. There&rsquo;s a high turnover rate. I try my best to maintain and keep mine up and running.</p>

<p>However, my old domain name expired and I had trouble getting in touch with my registrar to renew it. I really loved that domain name because it featured my frequently used user handle but I determined it to be a lost cause and ultimately let it go. Since GitHub introduced the student pack which included a .me domain for free for one year, I claimed it. Hence, <em>edelgrace.me</em> was born.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m using $50 credit from <a href="https://m.do.co/c/999dd787b62c">Digital Ocean</a> (yes, that is a referral link) for an Ubuntu droplet. However, it only runs on 512MB RAM so I opted to buy a cheap 1GB RAM server from <a href="http://ramnode.com">RamNode</a> (no, that is actually not a referral link). 512MB RAM would probably be enough for me since I don&rsquo;t receive many visits to my websites but you never know what the future might bring.</p>

<p>So on the event of my domain expiring, I moved all of my fanlistings over to the RamNode server. I exported a SQL file through phpMyAdmin from my website to recreate the database and ran it on the server. Since I wanted better naming conventions, I had to change all the config files in order to connect to the database. There were some issues that I had to plow through in Enthusiast, one being that the absolute path to the fanlisting script needed to be changed. Since I&rsquo;m no longer of thinking of sticking to hosting but rather maintaining my own servers, I don&rsquo;t think I should have to worry about changing the path ever again.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I had to contact <a href="http://thefanlistings.org">The Fanlisting Network</a> (TFL) in order to change my URLs. The network is to ensure that duplicate fanlistings don&rsquo;t exist. In theory, duplicate fanlistings can exist but the ones listed on TFL are more trusted.</p>

<p>In summary, that was my evening last night. It took up more time than I wanted but that&rsquo;s okay. I still managed to get some studying for CCNA done so all went well.</p>

        <p>My SO suggested we start a weekly drawing. So we pick a picture of something to draw and at the end of the week we share it. Last week we drew elephants.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Here&rsquo;s my elephant! I think I&rsquo;m going to stick to pencil drawings. I&rsquo;m not good at drawing by any means and this was pretty easy, honestly. It was fun drawing it though!</span></p>

<p>Versus what I was trying to draw&#8230; I see clearly what I should have done differently now, haha.</p>
