        <p>Yesterday I celebrated my 22nd birthday.</p>

<p>Every year we go to mass on my birthday in the morning as a family. This year my dad was working but my little cousin was with us because we were babysitting him so that was okay. Every year the homily is about the same. My birthday falls on the feast day of the Holy Family. So the homily is usually about obeying and honouring your parents; how Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were the perfect family; and so on. It kinda gets boring after a while.</p>

<p>After that I went over to my SO&rsquo;s house to chill for a bit before we headed out for lunch. We had to wait for his brother to come over to watch the house before we left.</p>

<p>For lunch I met a couple of friends at a vegan restaurant downtown called The Coup. I regret not taking picures but it was a nice and cozy place with extremely friendly servers. The food was definitely different as you might expect from a vegan place. One of my friends ordered a London Fog and it came with the tea strainer place on top of the cup. It was very fancy. The food was delicious as well. I ordered a hot pot that was deliciously creamy and filled to the brim with, you guessed it, veggies. No complaints here though, it was amazing.</p>

<p>The discussions while we were eating was pretty typical as I&rsquo;d expect from a bunch of nerds like us. Talked a bit about programming languages that don&rsquo;t have variable typing, Magic tournaments (I know nothing about Magic), shenanigans that happen in Physics club (I am not part of the physics club), anime, etc. I had a fun time and since I see my friends so rarely it was a nice treat.</p>

<p>Afterwards my SO and I got driven back to his place. We watched a bit of Warhammer: Vermintide character analysis videos on YouTube (I don&rsquo;t play that game). Then I had to go home, which wasn&rsquo;t all that bad since family was waiting for me.</p>

<p>My little cousin and my brother were playing video games, as always. My cousin had been playing Pokemon on my 3DS nonstop. At least my Pokemon are all trained now. I will admit, I did take a nap. When I woke up my aunt and uncle were there as well as my uncle&rsquo;s nephew. I groggily sat up and watched my brother play the video game I bought him for Christmas.</p>

<p>Once everyone was here, we ate. I ate a bunch of chips, spaghetti, lumpia, turkey, and some veggies. The cake I bought was cheesecake so I ate some of that too.</p>

<p>Eventually my cousins left and the parents were all that remained. They mostly drank and talked amongst themselves while my brother and I were absorbed in <em>Saints Row the Third</em>. Of course, they left eventually too. After a quick prayer we all went to bed.</p>

<p>I think I had a pretty good birthday. It&rsquo;s always nice to be surrounded by friends, family, and good food.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/2017-reading-resolutions/">2017 Reading Resolutions</a></h3>
        <h4>Dec 19, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/2017-reading-resolutions/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>This year I told myself I would read at least 25 books. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot but when you consider my reading history the past couple of years, that&rsquo;s a big number.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2015</strong>: 7 books + 3 graphic novels = 10 books</li>
<li><strong>2014</strong>: 19 books + 20 graphic novels = 39 books</li>
<li><strong>2013</strong>: 40 books + 30 graphic novels = 74 books</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong>: 18 books</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, not great numbers. Each year I have been reading less and less. 2013 was a weird anomaly. So far this year of 2016 (there&rsquo;s still like ten days left in the year&#8230;) I only managed to read 38 books, not including graphic novels. In total I&rsquo;ve read about 84 books. So that&rsquo;s still like 46 graphic novels that I&rsquo;ve read. I really wanted my novel to graphic novel ratio to be greater than or equal to one. However, I still met my goal of 25 books. So kudos to me!</p>

<p>This year I decided to opt for minimalism and not sign up for any reading challenges. To me, the most important thing is going through my to read list. If I even manage to make a small dent in the list, I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>

<p><strong>Here are my 2017 reading resoltuions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Read a total of 60 books.</li>
<li>Read at least 30 non-graphic novels.</li>
<li>Read more novels than graphic novels.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take out any books from the library that are not in my to read list.</li>
<li>Read at least half of the books on my 25 books to read in 2017 list</li>
</ul>

        </div>

        <p>I recently made a trip to the library. Here&rsquo;s what I managed to grab.</p>

<p><strong>Buried in Books: A Reader&rsquo;s Anthology by Julie Rugg</strong><br />
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don&rsquo;t recall exactly why they&rsquo;re on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me. I like reading about reading, a little ironic but it&rsquo;s interesting to see how others view reading.</p>

<p><strong>Madame Tussaud by Michelle Moran</strong><br />
Yet another unknown. I think this is due to the fact that it is historical fiction involving royalty during the French Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>The Midwich Cuckoos by Jogn Wyndham</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve been trying to get into science fiction. I adored the sci-fi and fantasy genres when I was younger. I don&rsquo;t quite know what happened to my preferences. I think I got all sappy and romantic but there&rsquo;s no reason why science fiction can&rsquo;t be romantic!</p>

<p><strong>Something New by Lucy Kinsley</strong><br />
Kinsley&rsquo;s previous works were pretty good and I think her drawings are cute and quirky. I love the autobiographical element.</p>

<p><strong>Two Kisses for Maddy by Matthew Logelin</strong><br />
I always try to get some non-fiction into my library trips. My go to is always memoirs. I have yet to read a memoir involving children. Good luck. I do not predict dry eyes for this one.</p>

<p><strong>You Can Act on Camera by D.W. Brown</strong><br />
This one wasn&rsquo;t on any list but I justified it because it was such a slim volume. Seems interesting. I think the book title is lying but we&rsquo;ll see how Brown defends his claim.</p>

        <h4>Dec 7, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/i-just-culled-my-book-wish-list/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
        
        <div class="tags">
            <ul>
              
              <li><a href="/categories/books">Books</a></li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        

<p>On Goodreads, my &ldquo;want-to-own&rdquo; shelf used to have 127 books in it. Now it has five.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been bit by the konmari bug. I&rsquo;ve konmari&rsquo;d my wardrobe and my books so far. I&rsquo;m still stuck on the books. I decided it would be fitting to prevent my book collection from growing back to it&rsquo;s ridiculous size and get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t spark joy on my book wish list.</p>

<h3 id="books-that-made-the-cut">Books that made the cut</h3>

<p><strong>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle</strong><br />
I read this book a couple of years ago. Although it&rsquo;s aimed at a younger audience, I really enjoyed this story. After reading it, I went to watch the animated movie as well. A small part of me has always been fascinated by unicorns and horses (I blame Sailor Moon as the source of that).</p>

<p><strong>The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde</strong><br />
To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much of this book but I do remember being in awe of Wilde&rsquo;s writing. I remember the last few pages more than anything. It was not exactly terrifying but it was a bit&#8230; Grotesque? I mostly want this book so I can re-read it.</p>

<p><strong>The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov</strong><br />
A couple of years ago I took a Russian Literature course and had to do a group presentation on this book. This book is probably one of the very few that I actually read front to back for a class. Actually, I read all the required books in this course. That was a first for me. Bulgakov&rsquo;s imagination is borderline execessive with this work but I do like his alternative history spin on Jesus&rsquo; life.</p>

<p><strong>The Glass Menagerie by Tenesee Williams</strong><br />
Marie Kondo&rsquo;s motto is to get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t spark joy. This play is incredibly sad but in a way, it also sparks joy for me. I find it to be such a heartbreakingly simple story that I can&rsquo;t help but appreciate it.</p>

<p><strong>Sabriel by Garth Nix</strong><br />
When I was younger, I was totally absorbed in fantasy. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, I hardly ever read any of the fantasy genre anymore. Sabriel really touched something in me. I got sucked into the world. One of my childhood friends recently (as in, like a couple of weeks ago) told me that I reminded her of Sabriel. She was the one who recommended this book to me way back when. That&rsquo;s another thing that I appreciate about this book.</p>

<h3 id="books-that-almost-made-the-cut">Books that almost made the cut</h3>

<p><strong>Paradise Kiss series by Ai Yazawa</strong><br />
Okay, I&rsquo;m still on the fence about this one. I love this series and I love Ai Yazawa&rsquo;s work. Paradise Kiss is one of those series that sat with me for a while. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to read this one over again and see how I feel about it. The reason why I&rsquo;m not sure is because I feel like there&rsquo;s something unsettling about it. It&rsquo;s a little similar to how I feel about <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. It&rsquo;s incredibly bittersweet. There are some scenes that I remember that actually make me feel a pang in my chest. I&rsquo;m tearing up right now thinking about it!</p>

<p><strong>A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray</strong><br />
The Gemma Doyle series is pretty okay but damn, the covers are gorgeous (yes, I&rsquo;m a little shallow). I love the gothic setting and historical aspect of it but unfortunately, it was lacking in content a little. It would be nice to have it sit on my shelf and look pretty but I would never pick it up and read it again.</p>

        <p>I recently resolved not to take out any library books unless they were on my to read list. Here&rsquo;s what I took out on my latest trip to the library!</p>

<p><strong>Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson</strong><br />
I don&rsquo;t remember why or how this book got onto my to read list but I know that it&rsquo;s been on the list for quite a while. I was glad to see the book sitting on the shelf since I&rsquo;ve been looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Sputnik Sweetheart by Haruki Murakami</strong><br />
Pretty much all of Murakami&rsquo;s books are on my to read list. <em>Sputnik Sweetheart</em> is no exception. Usually there are three things I always go check when I go to the library: the manga section, Jodi Picoult, and Haruki Murakami. Murakami is pretty popular so I was lucky I got a hold on this novel.</p>

<p><strong>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bronte by Syrie James</strong><br />
I adore the Bronte family and pretty much everything Bronte related, non-fiction or fiction, is on my to read list.</p>
