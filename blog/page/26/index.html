        <pre>CREATE USER 'user'@'server' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
GRANT PRIVILEGES ON database.table TO 'user'@'server';</pre>

<p>I recently bought a VPS from Ramnode and started tinkering on it. I needed to create a database for my fanlistings. Back when I was on shared hosting, I would use cPanel and phpMyAdmin to do all that. This is admittedly another TIL that I didn&rsquo;t learn today but, rather, relearned today because the information slipped my mind. Maybe I need to rename this little segment to &ldquo;TIRL.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Okay, this wasn&rsquo;t the first time I learned about this but I did relearn this while talking to my SO about the AI textbook he was reading.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a concept called best first search. The basic example is traversing through a tree. Each node that the algorithm visits, it adds the node to an array solely for visited nodes. It keeps another array for nodes it hasn&rsquo;t yet visited. While it traverses through the nodes, it sorts the visited node array so that the best node is at the start of the array.</p>

<p>This does pose the problem of local maxima. The best search first algorithm gives the best result at that moment for the current search space. So it doesn&rsquo;t focus on efficiency but reducing the search space. This doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the best solution at any point in the search but the best solution for that point of time in the search (if that makes any sense at all).</p>

        <p>New Years Resolutions are no longer the in thing. I recently turned 22 and it feels like my life is whizzing by now. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my goals but there are just too many that I have for one year and a couple that will go beyond 2017. So I figured a 25 before 25 would be appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in university since I was 17. Five years later and I&rsquo;m still here. While I do love the academic environment, I seriously can&rsquo;t wait to graduate. It&rsquo;s about time that I move on from school, even if it&rsquo;s a little scary.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents&rsquo; house</strong></p>

<p>It was only until recently that I resolved to move out and move out for good. When I was young, I happily accepted the fact that my parents would like to live with me in their retirement. Not anymore. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about myself and my boundaries towards my parents. I think it would be best for all of us for me to move out.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest steps towards responsible personal finance is maxing out my tax free savings account. As of 2016, my total contribution limit is around 30k. As the years go by, that will only increase. Hopefully I can do it.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open a RRSP account</strong></p>

<p>The only reason why I don&rsquo;t have one yet is because I don&rsquo;t have a permanent job yet. I simply don&rsquo;t make enough to warrant an RRSP. However, if I want to retire gracefully, an RRSP is essential.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong></p>

<p>Every graduates worst nightmare is to leave university only to land a part time job at the grocery store. I&rsquo;m hoping to land a job in networking or program development. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be right away, I can stand working retail for a couple of months.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong></p>

<p>Every year I want to read at least 50 books. I&rsquo;m an avid reader. This year I managed to make it work so I&rsquo;m hoping I can continue to make it work for the next couple of years.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong></p>

<p>One of my friends joke that I&rsquo;ve been playing the first installation of Dragon Age for years. So far I&rsquo;ve clocked around 100 hours and I&rsquo;m definitely nowhere near done it yet. It&rsquo;s those side quests that sidetrack me, I swear.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong></p>

<p>A couple of years ago I started working on a TCG but it fell through the cracks. I&rsquo;d love to take up that project again and finish it. I love TCGs so it would be a fun endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday I started making a small Pomodoro app. I&rsquo;m making decent progress but it&rsquo;s nowhere near polished. It would be great to finish it.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong></p>

<p>Another project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for a while. I keep starting and restarting it. I don&rsquo;t want to rely on GoodReads and I fancy the idea of having a local copy of the books I&rsquo;ve read.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver&rsquo;s license</strong></p>

<p>22 and without a license. I feel like a burden asking my friends for rides everywhere. I do like walking around everywhere because I desperately need the exercise. However, the city I live in is not really commuter friendly so a car would make things extremely easier.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong></p>

<p>Many of my friends are alike in that we are all tech geeks. From gaming to building PCs to programming, you name it. I think it would be nice to make friends who aren&rsquo;t necessarily into the whole tech thing. Different perspectives is essential for a well-rounded world view. Plus, I&rsquo;d like to be introduced into something that isn&rsquo;t, well, tech.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong></p>

<p>I envy those who can lift and run and be athletic. I&rsquo;d really love to lose some weight, cut down on the body fat, and not be struggling for air after walking three flights of stairs.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong></p>

<p>My dentist always begs me to floss but no matter how many horror stories she gives me, I just don&rsquo;t do it. I know I should. I really have to.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m dehydrated <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. I&rsquo;m convinced that I have years shaved off my life purely due to the fact that I do not drink enough water. I don&rsquo;t notice my thirst cues very well until my head is throbbing, my lips a cracked, and my throat is parched. Dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong></p>

<p>If I want to move out, I should probably learn how to cook. And not just making sandwiches. I&rsquo;d love to be able to make pasta.</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled to another country without family once but it was a school field trip. I would love to go to Japan but that&rsquo;s expensive. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just cross the border down south again?</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong></p>

<p>I started the Konmari process but have yet to progress past my books. It would be beneficial to accomplish this before I move out. Less stuff to pack!</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong></p>

<p>I had my first alcoholic beverage this year. I&rsquo;ve never been black out drunk before and I think there should be a first time for everything. Hopefully I don&rsquo;t spiral from there.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through my CCNA course so getting my CCNA is totally on the horizon.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong></p>

<p>Zoo Lights is a local festival that happens every winter. I&rsquo;ve never gone before because my parents have been paranoid about my being out in the cold at night. I think it would make for a good future date.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong></p>

<p>Oof, it got heavy suddenly. I&rsquo;ve been struggling with depression for a couple of years now. I think I&rsquo;ve identified some sources and I&rsquo;d like to come up with a plan to combat it.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong></p>

<p>I have a pen pal whom I haven&rsquo;t written to in months. Well, I sent him a quick Christmas card but that doesn&rsquo;t count in my opinion. I&rsquo;d love to pick up the pen again as I do miss his correspondences!</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been to a concert since my very first concert (My Chemical Romance, RIP). I have a couple of bands and artists that I&rsquo;d love to see live but it&rsquo;s just a matter of if they come to Calgary! But it would totally be cool to take a road trip outside of the city to watch some live music.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong></p>

<p>There are too many movies that I have not seen before. Just to name a few: V for Vendetta, Clueless, Pulp Fiction, Schindler&rsquo;s List, Singing in the Rain, Princess Mononoke, Gone Girl, Akira, The Princess Bride&#8230;</p>

        <p>Yesterday I celebrated my 22nd birthday.</p>

<p>Every year we go to mass on my birthday in the morning as a family. This year my dad was working but my little cousin was with us because we were babysitting him so that was okay. Every year the homily is about the same. My birthday falls on the feast day of the Holy Family. So the homily is usually about obeying and honouring your parents; how Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were the perfect family; and so on. It kinda gets boring after a while.</p>

<p>After that I went over to my SO&rsquo;s house to chill for a bit before we headed out for lunch. We had to wait for his brother to come over to watch the house before we left.</p>

<p>For lunch I met a couple of friends at a vegan restaurant downtown called The Coup. I regret not taking picures but it was a nice and cozy place with extremely friendly servers. The food was definitely different as you might expect from a vegan place. One of my friends ordered a London Fog and it came with the tea strainer place on top of the cup. It was very fancy. The food was delicious as well. I ordered a hot pot that was deliciously creamy and filled to the brim with, you guessed it, veggies. No complaints here though, it was amazing.</p>

<p>The discussions while we were eating was pretty typical as I&rsquo;d expect from a bunch of nerds like us. Talked a bit about programming languages that don&rsquo;t have variable typing, Magic tournaments (I know nothing about Magic), shenanigans that happen in Physics club (I am not part of the physics club), anime, etc. I had a fun time and since I see my friends so rarely it was a nice treat.</p>

<p>Afterwards my SO and I got driven back to his place. We watched a bit of Warhammer: Vermintide character analysis videos on YouTube (I don&rsquo;t play that game). Then I had to go home, which wasn&rsquo;t all that bad since family was waiting for me.</p>

<p>My little cousin and my brother were playing video games, as always. My cousin had been playing Pokemon on my 3DS nonstop. At least my Pokemon are all trained now. I will admit, I did take a nap. When I woke up my aunt and uncle were there as well as my uncle&rsquo;s nephew. I groggily sat up and watched my brother play the video game I bought him for Christmas.</p>

<p>Once everyone was here, we ate. I ate a bunch of chips, spaghetti, lumpia, turkey, and some veggies. The cake I bought was cheesecake so I ate some of that too.</p>

<p>Eventually my cousins left and the parents were all that remained. They mostly drank and talked amongst themselves while my brother and I were absorbed in <em>Saints Row the Third</em>. Of course, they left eventually too. After a quick prayer we all went to bed.</p>

<p>I think I had a pretty good birthday. It&rsquo;s always nice to be surrounded by friends, family, and good food.</p>

        <p>This year I told myself I would read at least 25 books. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot but when you consider my reading history the past couple of years, that&rsquo;s a big number.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2015</strong>: 7 books + 3 graphic novels = 10 books</li>
<li><strong>2014</strong>: 19 books + 20 graphic novels = 39 books</li>
<li><strong>2013</strong>: 40 books + 30 graphic novels = 74 books</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong>: 18 books</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, not great numbers. Each year I have been reading less and less. 2013 was a weird anomaly. So far this year of 2016 (there&rsquo;s still like ten days left in the year&#8230;) I only managed to read 38 books, not including graphic novels. In total I&rsquo;ve read about 84 books. So that&rsquo;s still like 46 graphic novels that I&rsquo;ve read. I really wanted my novel to graphic novel ratio to be greater than or equal to one. However, I still met my goal of 25 books. So kudos to me!</p>

<p>This year I decided to opt for minimalism and not sign up for any reading challenges. To me, the most important thing is going through my to read list. If I even manage to make a small dent in the list, I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>

<p><strong>Here are my 2017 reading resoltuions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Read a total of 60 books.</li>
<li>Read at least 30 non-graphic novels.</li>
<li>Read more novels than graphic novels.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take out any books from the library that are not in my to read list.</li>
<li>Read at least half of the books on my 25 books to read in 2017 list</li>
</ul>
