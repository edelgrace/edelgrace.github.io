<blockquote>
<p>Love as sickness and immorality, sex as entrapment and revenge—these are the themes that the Nobel Prize-winning author of <em>Snow Country</em> dramatizes with such coolly mesmerizing power in this novel. At its heart is is a destructive love affair between a married writer and a teenage girl that continues to haunt both of them more than twenty years after their last embrace—and whose lingering bitterness poisons everyone around them.</p>

<p>What begins as a sentimental reunion between the aging Oki Toshio and the reclusive artist Otoko Ueno escalates into a sinister erotic vendetta. For Keiko, the strange, intense young girl who is Otoko&rsquo;s protegee and lover, is determined to avenge the older woman&rsquo;s past humiliation—even if that means using her own beauty as a weapon. Shifting unpredictably between tenderness and obsession, serenity and savagery, <em>Beauty and Sadness</em> confirms Kawabata&rsquo;s reputation as a modern Japanese master who can turn the tightening of an <em>obi</em> into something infinitely suggestive and perverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kawabata haunts me. How apt, considering by the time this blog post is published, it&rsquo;s nearly Hallowe&rsquo;en.</p>

<p>This is the third Kawabata book that I&rsquo;ve read. I just keep coming back for more. Every time I find myself in the library, I wander over to the &ldquo;K&rdquo; authors and see if there&rsquo;s anything there by Kawabata.</p>

<p>There is a pattern in Kawabata&rsquo;s works. His characters are largely unlikeable and one-dimensional, especially the protagonist. What is with Kawabata and writing useless men as protagonists? Because Oki is the most boring and dull protagonist.</p>

<p>Kawabata, however, redeems himself in his prose. Even with these heavily flawed characters, Kawabata manages to make me feel these character&rsquo;s struggles and I can sympathize with them because he can portray them so well.</p>

<p>Concerning the controversial subject matter, I did not read the summary before reading this book. When it was revealed that Oki was a 30-something-year-old man and Otoko was just 16 when their affair started, I was startled. I don&rsquo;t want to say Kawabata doesn&rsquo;t make a big deal about it because he does. The book essentially revolves around the messy aftermath of Otoko and Oki&rsquo;s relationship.</p>

<p>Otoko is undeniably broken after. She miscarriages with Oki&rsquo;s child and is sent to a mental institution. She becomes a successful painter and begins a relationship with a young woman (girl? I don&rsquo;t know how old she is) named Keiko. In many ways, this relationship mirrors Otoko&rsquo;s relationship with Oki.</p>

<p>In a way, Kawabata forces you to accept the fact that Oki had done this to Otoko. He does romanticize it too much for my comfort (Otoko continues to pine over Oki even twenty years later despite all he put her through) but he does not neglect to show how harmful the relationship was.</p>

<p>Keiko is the character who realizes how despicable Oki is and she tries to get revenge. I was torn in a couple places. Even though Keiko claims to want revenge against Oki, I felt like Keiko was really getting revenge on Otoko. I think, deep down, Keiko knew that Otoko did not love Keiko or did not love her as deeply as she did Oki.</p>

<p>Honestly, Keiko is the weakest point in the story for me. I did not care for her one bit. I saw the ending coming a mile away. Keiko and Oki&rsquo;s son go out for a boat ride. Oki&rsquo;s son presumably drowns but Keiko lives. I can&rsquo;t help but feel Keiko was malicious enough to plan it out. It was the highest form of revenge. Otoko has her own child taken away from her. Oki must feel the same pain as well.</p>

<p>Overall, not Kawabata&rsquo;s strongest. But I relish these melodramatic, melancholic, love-stricken stories of his.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria</strong> (-)
I&rsquo;m still riding that Coheed and Cambria hype. I&rsquo;m trying <em>so hard</em> not to be listening to them <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. I just want to play their new album over an over again!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Metric</strong> (*)
I have been playing a couple of their songs over and over again. They really make me want to jump up and dance!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Daughter</strong> (*)
This is another case of replaying a band over and over again. <em>Youth</em> is such a good song, I always feel it every single time I listen to it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>椎名林檎</strong> (+5)
Shiina Ringo came out with a song recently-ish and her catalog is now on Spotify. So I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of her this week.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>boy pablo</strong> (-4)
My boy, Pablo, is still a goodie but I feel like i&rsquo;m listening to too much of him. I only like two of his songs (or more accurately, I&rsquo;ve only listened to two of his songs).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kero Kero Bonito</strong> (*)
They released an album the same week that Coheed and Cambria released theirs and I like it a lot! <em>Only Acting</em> is my favourite from the album. I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it. Like a noisey grunge pop rock?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse</strong> (*)
I have no idea what triggered my Amy Winehouse resurgence. I loved her a lot back in junior high with her <em>Back to Black</em> album.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Childish Gambino</strong> (-)
<em>Feels Like Summer</em> is still a bop even though we&rsquo;re well into October. And since I&rsquo;m doing Sober October this month, <em>Sober</em> is my ironic song of the month. Even though the song title is &ldquo;Sober&rdquo; the chorus goes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be sober.&rdquo; The opposite of what I want but hey, it&rsquo;s catchy!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Green Day</strong> (*)
Wow, this is a surprise for me. I have no idea where this came from. I don&rsquo;t remember listening to this much Green Day. I did recently went through their entire catalog on Spotify and saved the songs that I like. I love a lot of their songs. It&rsquo;s always nostalgic listening to their songs. <em>Whatshername</em>  and <em>Redundant</em> are two songs I can think of listening to this week. So good.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joji</strong> (-7)
Ahhh, Joji. <em>SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK</em> is getting a little too melancholy for me. It&rsquo;s a good song though. I need to check out some of his other songs. There&rsquo;s this one song I do like but it&rsquo;s not on Spotify. Joji sampled and remixed a song and it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures</strong> (-)
This week Coheed is a little less dominating. But I still have been listening to a lot of them. I just can&rsquo;t keep my hands off <em>Vaxis: I</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</strong> (+1)
This album is slowly growing on me. It really is a huge epic. I need to take a couple more playthroughs with this.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension</strong> (+1)
Nostalgia is really hitting me hard with this. I say this a lot but <em>Ascension</em> is definitely one of my top albums of all time. It&rsquo;s just so good.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I&rsquo;m Burning Star IV: I</strong> (-2)
I don&rsquo;t want to wear out <em>Good Apollo I</em> too much. This album is another nostalgic classic.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kero Kero Bonito — Time &lsquo;n&rsquo; Place</strong> (*)
They released this album the same week Coheed released <em>Vaxis I</em> and I love it!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse — Back to Black</strong> (*)
Really the only Amy Winehouse album that I&rsquo;ve listened to. I need to get a proper listen though. I&rsquo;m really only familiar with the singles and <em>Me and Mr. Jones</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK</strong> (*)
This is just a single. I&rsquo;m kinda looking forward to the album? <em>YEAH RIGHT</em> was a little iffy but I&rsquo;m optimistic for the rest of the album.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Front Bottoms — Talon of the Hawk</strong> (*)
One of my friends introduced me to this band and I really like them unironically. The vocalist has such a weird voice that I don&rsquo;t think is that good but it adds character. It&rsquo;s really folksy and it works for this band.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sharon Van Etten — Epic</strong> (*)
Oh man, why didn&rsquo;t I find about Sharon Van Etten earlier? <em>Epic</em> is a heartbreaking album. It details an abusive relationship Etten went through and her lyricism is  just so beautifully tragic. I love her.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mystery Skulls — Forever</strong> (*)
This band came up on my Discovery Weekly playlist, if I recall correctly. <em>Forever</em> is a decent album but there are a couple of standouts. One of my friends showed me the music video for <em>Ghost</em> and it&rsquo;s great. They recently came out with another music video and my favourite song from the album, <em>Every Note</em> is featured for like thirty seconds on it.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Kero Kero Bonito — Only Acting</strong> (*)
<em>I thought I was only acting but I felt exactly like it was all for real.</em> This song is so fun! I love it. I love the noisey grunge and the glitchy 80&rsquo;s/90&rsquo;s aesthetic.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Domino the Destitute</strong> (*)
Definitely one of Coheed&rsquo;s best songs. I&rsquo;m so surprised they don&rsquo;t play it more often in their shows. It&rsquo;s just so&hellip; Hard hitting. I get chills up my spine when I listen to it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Evagria the Faithful</strong> (*)
I&rsquo;ve spoken about <em>Evagria</em> before but I love this song. It&rsquo;s groovy and funky and haunting. They really nailed the prog elements in this song.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK</strong> (*)
A small part of me is a little weirded out at how depressing Joji&rsquo;s songs are. Who hurt you Joji, who hurt you? But it makes for good songs.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — A Favour House Atlantic</strong> (*)
This is a poppy bop and a fun one to listen to live. <em>Good eye, sniper. Now I shoot, you run!</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — The Dark Sentencer</strong> (-3)
This song is slowly wearing out for me. But it&rsquo;s a good opener to a great album and a good head banger.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sharon Van Etten — A Crime</strong> (*)
<em>To say the things I want to say to you would be a crime/To admit I&rsquo;m still in love with you after all this time/I&rsquo;d rather let you touch my arm until you die.</em> Ahhh. Sharon Van Etten! Who hurt you?? It&rsquo;s such a beautiful and painful song. I love it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>boy pablo — Everytime</strong> (*)
The song that started it all for these boys. It&rsquo;s really mellow.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thank you Scientist — Feed the Horses</strong> (*)
This band is on the record label that the frontman of Coheed and Cambria founded. They are so proggy, I enjoy it. They have a lot of jazz elements which is pretty cool.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mystery Skulls — Ghost</strong> (*)
Such. A. Bop. I want to sing along to it all the time. When I&rsquo;m in the office and this comes on, I definitely start mouthing the lyrics.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Recommend one horror novel for nonhorror readers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <em>Frankenstein</em>. I can only say that because that&rsquo;s the only horror novel that I&rsquo;ve ever read. But it&rsquo;s a classic for a reason. It&rsquo;s also interesting how the original story is as there&rsquo;s been so many interpretations and spin offs. I really enjoyed it and Shelley is a wonderful author. I think it&rsquo;s the right amount of &ldquo;kinda horror but not really horror.&rdquo; In those times, the concept of reanimating a human body would be horrific. Unfortunately now the idea doesn&rsquo;t seem so extreme. Try to read it in the eyes of someone who has never heard of zombies before!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It&rsquo;s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there&rsquo;s a better way.</p>

<p>In <em>Deep Work</em>, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four &ldquo;rules,&rdquo; for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.</p>

<p>A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. <em>Deep Work</em> is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cal has a lot of good ideas but I hate how he presented them.</p>

<p>I pretty much skimmed through the first section that was trying to convince me that deep work was worth it. Of course, I know it&rsquo;s worth it, why else would I be reading this book? As a computer scientist, I don&rsquo;t mind that the examples he spouts off are largely tech-related and usually intended for office/self-employed workers. However, there&rsquo;s a lot of anecdotes in this book. There are some mentions of studies here and there but the evidence is still lacking.</p>

<p>When it comes to social media, he comes off as pretentious and snobby even if he is mostly right. I&rsquo;ve read some of Cal&rsquo;s blog posts before and I had the same impression of him back then. I am a bit defensive over the usage of my social media even though I know I&rsquo;d probably be better off without. But Cal brings up the point of, think what you could be doing in your time instead. And I agree.</p>

<p>Regardless, there&rsquo;s a lot of things I want to try out from this book.</p>

<ul>
<li>Commit to a rhythmic philosophy of deep work</li>
<li>Ritualize where and how I will work</li>
<li>Follow 4DX (quick note, this largely taken from another author)</li>
<li>Focus on just the important goal</li>
<li>Measure new behaviours that drive success AKA keeping track of deep work hours (i.e. lead measures)</li>
<li>Keep a scoreboard (like a streak)</li>
<li>Create accountability with weekly reviews</li>
<li>Take breaks from focus over distractions (schedule hours dedicated to the Internet instead of hours dedicated to work)</li>
<li>Quit social media (almost)</li>
<li>Re-evaluate the social networks I&rsquo;m a part of (including Goodreads)</li>
<li>Take a month-long &ldquo;sabbatical&rdquo; from social media and see if anyone misses me</li>
<li>Schedule every minute of my day</li>
<li>Finish work by 16:30 (in the book Cal says 17:30 but I&rsquo;m assuming he starts work at 9:00 whereas I start work at 8:00)</li>
<li>Become hard to reach (e-mail and phone only, maybe Discord still?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, there are good things to try out with this book. Cal takes until the very end to say deep work is not for everybody (with his usual pretentious air). I&rsquo;m going to take a crack at it. I&rsquo;ve found that ever since I&rsquo;ve graduated and started working, my hours are incredibly limited. After careful attention, I&rsquo;ve realized that much of my day is dedicated to shallow activities. I want to get things done (yes, I&rsquo;ve read David Allen&rsquo;s GTD).</p>

Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you were to dress up as a literary figure {author or character} for Halloween, who would it be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm&hellip; That&rsquo;s a good question. I would totally dress up as Anne Shirley from Anne of Green Gables. I don&rsquo;t think I could pull off the red hair though. It might be weird seeing an asian Anne but the Japanese really like Anne so it must have been done before, right? I just don&rsquo;t know how recognizable Anne would be. I might get mistaken for Pipi Longstocking or the Wendy&rsquo;s mascot.</p>

<p>I think it would be super cool to dress up as any Austen or Bronte character. It&rsquo;s a little disheartening because those characters don&rsquo;t really have distinguishing physical characteristics that would make you go, &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re dressed up as Jane Eyre!&rdquo; I do adore the 18th and 19th century fashion though and I think it would be a bunch of fun to dress up as someone from those times. I think if I were handing out the candy the kids would just see me dressed up as someone from a long time ago.</p>
