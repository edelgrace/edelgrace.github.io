<p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of weeks since 2017 has started. I started off the new year with some tweaks to my bullet journal. 2016 wasn&rsquo;t the best year for using my bullet journal. I used it a lot when I was in school but not so much when I was working. I&rsquo;m aiming to be more productive outside of work this year though! In light of my new goal, I decided it was best to revamp my bullet journal. This year&rsquo;s theme is work-life balance. One of my friends jokingly said, &ldquo;It seems like you never have any fun.&rdquo; Thus, I resolve to have more fun!</p>

<p><strong>Monthly Habit Trackers</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never stuck to a habit tracker in full before. This year I aimed to make them as minimal as possible. No rulers were used in making these. It took about half an hour to do all twelve months. I condensed the monthly log because I really don&rsquo;t have that many events, usually.</p>

<p><strong>Monthly Health Trackers</strong></p>

<p>On the other side of the monthly habit trackers are the monthly health trackers. This mostly focuses on physical health with a side of mental health too. I&rsquo;m trying to track my calories, steps I&rsquo;ve taken, weight, and my mood each day.</p>

<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Since I had a couple of weeks to settle into my bullet journal, I can safely say that I&rsquo;m still pretty bad at using my bullet journal everyday. Honestly, this is definitely a mental health thing. When I find myself in a depressive slump, I do not feel like doing anything. You can tell when my mind became a little clouded and it wasn&rsquo;t until a couple of days ago that I finally got out of it. Hopefully, February will fare better.</p>

<p>How <strong>many</strong>? As in, a specific number? Too many to count. Actually, that&rsquo;s not accurate. I don&rsquo;t really know the answer to that question. There have been a lot of books that I gave up on. The most recent book was <em>The Rebel</em> by Albert Camus, however I am determined to finish it. A couple of Amy Tan books were hard for me to complete. <em>Cryptonomicon</em> is another one that I&rsquo;ve started and restarted to read over and over again. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot&#8230; No way I could list (or count) them all!</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>One morning after we woke up, my SO wiped the bed and exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much of your hair!&rdquo; We both laughed it off but I felt a sense of dread. I&rsquo;m no stranger to hair loss. For years now I&rsquo;ve notice more hair in the shower, on my pillow, on the floor, on my laptop, etc. When I go to my doctor every year, he reassures me it&rsquo;s normal and gets me to do bloodwork that always comes back clean.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just my genetics at play for my dad is balding and my mom&rsquo;s hair is pretty thin (due to pulling it out, however). Or maybe it&rsquo;s because I recently restricting my calories again. Or because I started working a 9 to 5 job and I am actually more stressed than I feel.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this post, my mom commented on the thinning of the top of my head. Tears formed in my eyes almost immediately.</p>

<p>The thought of losing my hair is scary. I&rsquo;m not conventially attractive and my hair is definitely not my best point, but it isn&rsquo;t a negative. It is pretty thick but not soft and silky. Still, I get choked up thinking about parting ways with my hair.</p>

<p>As a woman, it&rsquo;s particularly hard. For men, balding is not unheard of. Of course, that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s not as hard for men and I&rsquo;m sure for people whose gender lies outside of the binary, it&rsquo;s still a struggle. But there is so much importance put on a woman&rsquo;s hair. It&rsquo;s rare for people to think about hair loss in women and it&rsquo;s a shock when people see it.</p>

<p>However, there is no shortage of women who are bald (or have closely cropped hair) or who have had their stints with baldness. Amber Rose, Willow Smith, Sinead Connor, Natalie Portman, etc. With the whole feminist movement, more and more women are jumping at the chance to deviate from gender norms.</p>

<p>At my brother&rsquo;s graduation last year, a very sweet and cute girl walked the stage bald. She was undergoing chemo therapy which is a bit different but she was so confident and radiated beauty. She was also Filipino, like me, and I had never seen a bald Filipino girl before. And she rocked it!</p>

<p>So maybe being bald wouldn&rsquo;t be a life changer.</p>

<p>My hairline is receeding slowly and the bald spot on the top of my head is not so large. Maybe I still start using Rogaine or Nizoral. We&rsquo;ll see how well that goes.</p>

<p>If it gets particularly bad, I think I will just shave it all off. I admit, I&rsquo;m a bit excited at the prospect of wearing wigs. Maybe I could go blonde, or wear a cute style that my hair never agreed with, or have crazy coloured wigs.</p>

<p>Or I could forego the wigs entirely and just start wearing makeup. Makeup is another thing I haven&rsquo;t been able to experiment (because I&rsquo;m broke and always rushing in the morning). Bald women with great make up are awesome (Becky from Buzzfeed comes to mind).</p>

<p>Either way, it&rsquo;ll be an adventure.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Disclaimer: Lyrics relating to suicide is mentioned in this post.</p>

<p>Another disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not good at writing reviews but I do like expressing my opinions. This is in no way a professional review but rather how I personally feel about this album.</p>

<p>I know Marina and the Diamonds&rsquo; album <em>Electra Heart</em> is one of her personally least favourite works but I like it a lot. Many people think <em>Electra Heart</em> represents an alter-ego but it&rsquo;s rather a personality that Marina holds in disdain. I actually kinda love it. While some songs do resonate with my own personality, the overall theme of the corrupted American dream doesn&rsquo;t coincide with my reality. But you have to admit that there are some catchy tunes on this album.</p>

<p>The album starts off with <em>Bubblegum Bitch</em>, which I was really apprehensive about at first. It turned out to be a really high energy song with a fun and catchy chorus. The guitar ripping througg the song really made it for me. It added a certain ironic feel that set the tone for the rest of the album.</p>

<p>The much loved <em>Primadonna</em> comes right after. It&rsquo;s a little jarring to think about two different types of people as the topic one after the other (although, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive personalities). However, this was the song that got me sucked into Marina and the Diamonds. I hate to say it but Marina&rsquo;s voice is perfect for capturing the entitled persona in this song and I fall all over it. Even though you know she doesn&rsquo;t deserve anything good, you can&rsquo;t help but give it to her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not a huge fan of <em>Lies</em>. I like slower songs but I really hate that cheesy drum clap thing going on. It&rsquo;s not you, Marina, it&rsquo;s me.</p>

<p><em>Homewrecker</em> is a favourite of mine. I love the image a stereotypical American woman casually destroying marriages. Okay, that sounded bad. I don&rsquo;t condone that at all but I just find it amazing how well this song captures the stereotype. It&rsquo;s so easy to picture this person in your head.</p>

<p>The next track on the album is another one of my favourites: <em>Starring Role</em>. While thinking about this song, I realized how self centered all the songs on the album are so far and this is no exception. This song speaks about being the number one in someone&rsquo;s life and not willing to take second place. However, it&rsquo;s not as selfish as it sounds and I can sympathize with it. I also can overlook the cheesy clapping because I get chills whenever Marina sings &ldquo;The starring role.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will have to admit that I don&rsquo;t have any strong feelings for <em>The State of Dreaming</em>. I like how it picks up during the chorus and they way Marina sings &ldquo;My life is play&rdquo; but in between those moments, it&rsquo;s a little boring. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s a song that I would skip sometimes.</p>

<p><em>Power and Control</em> is true to its name and Marina&rsquo;s voice just exudes the song&rsquo;s theme. There&rsquo;s something about that booming voice that portrays confidence that the song calls for; someone ambitious who wants to get as much as possible with as little work as possible.</p>

<p>A lot of people seem to like <em>Teen Idle</em> a lot but I think this is one of my least favourite tracks on the album. The teen angst is just too much for me. Much of this album is over the top and extravagant but I can&rsquo;t seem to enjoy this. I find the song a little bit boring but I like the irony in how the line &ldquo;feeling super, super, super (super!) suicidal&rdquo; is executed in a cheery way. But this song doesn&rsquo;t jive with me at all.</p>

<p>The slow songs continue with <em>Valley of the Dolls</em>. While this isn&rsquo;t a super favourite, I don&rsquo;t mind this song much. I like the chorus a lot and the lyrics are pretty relatable. In my opinion, this song speaks of donning multiple personalities but ultimately not knowing who you really are at the core. It&rsquo;s a pretty dark and speaks of death. Death of another personality or the physical person, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>I understand that the album is essentially a concept album that is operatic and has a story arch in the fashion as Green Day&rsquo;s <em>American Idiot</em> but it&rsquo;s a little bit draining to have so many slow songs in a row. There are theories that this album&rsquo;s second half indicated the dying of the Electra Heart persona. This is not to say that <em>Hypocrates</em> isn&rsquo;t a good song but I prefer it when I&rsquo;m not listening to the album as a whole. I really like the mellow guitar and and the twinkling strings and Marina&rsquo;s voice taking a softer and less abrasive tone. This is another song that I don&rsquo;t mind much but don&rsquo;t like it enough to save it to my Spotify library.</p>

<p>The album finishes off with <em>Fear and Loathing</em> which marks the end of Electra Heart. I do not like this song much. However, I am impressed with Marina&rsquo;s higher register even if I still prefer when she reaches those lower notes. Conceptually, it isn&rsquo;t a bad way to end the album.</p>

<p>Overall, I drastically prefer the first half of the album. I like this album but it&rsquo;s not one I&rsquo;d go out of my way to buy but rather buy select songs off of it. The concept is interesting and Marina doesn&rsquo;t play around when it comes to her lyrics. It&rsquo;s pretty cohesive as a whole. I really admire Marina and I like how she is continually trying out different things. Let&rsquo;s see where she goes next with her music!</p>

        <p>Last week I wanted to draw a tree. The thought came to me while my SO and I were eating lunch at the Vietnamese restaurant. Behind him there was a large plastic palm tree and that was when I suggested trees. We ended up finding a picture of snowy winter trees on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pics">/r/pics</a>.</p>
