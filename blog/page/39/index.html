<h3 id="solution">Solution:</h3>

<p>Edit <code>~/.lftp/rc</code> so that it contains <code>set ssl:check-hostname no</code>. What this does is pretty self explanatory. If the hostname in the certificate does not match the hostname you&rsquo;re attempting to connect to, it doesn&rsquo;t matter because it won&rsquo;t check for that in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="the-context">The context:</h3>

<p>I recently wanted to implement version control for my websites because all too often I think to myself, &ldquo;I wish I knew what a previous version of this file looked lik&rdquo;. So since I&rsquo;m on shared hosting and don&rsquo;t have my own server, I resorted to using <a href="https://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp">git-ftp</a> for deploying my websites. So far, it&rsquo;s working great. However, I momentarily forgot I started using this and made some changes on one of my pages through cPanel. I tried pulling the latest pages using <code>git-ftp pull</code> and encountered this error.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been using Spotify a lot. I only ever use it when I&rsquo;m at my computer. When I&rsquo;m on the go, I turn to my trusty iPod classic. Since I use the free version of Spotify (now that I have a job, I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m a broke college student anymore but I can say that I&rsquo;m still cheap), being able to choose what I listen to is a must and Spotify mobile doesn&rsquo;t have that ability. The contrast between the songs on my iPod and Spotify is staggering.</p>

<p>On my iPod, I have a bunch of foreign artists, mainly Japanese and Korean with a side of Taiwanese. If you look at my Spotify, it&rsquo;s mostly a bunch of really poppy Western mainstream music. I&rsquo;ve discovered a lot of new artists through Spotify simply because the Japanese catalogues on Spotify is sparse and I value accurate tagging (English translations of song titles vs. the original Japanese characters on the back of a CD) too much to listen to some of the Japanese music that is on Spotify.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s always a treat when I happen to get my hands on an iTunes gift card (remember, I said I&rsquo;m cheap). Except it&rsquo;s also hard trying to figure out what I want to buy with it because I can only choose the best. I only managed to squeeze out 9 songs from my $10 gift card but it&rsquo;s like 35 minutes worth of music so $0.28 cents per minute? I actually have no idea if that&rsquo;s a good amount or not.</p>

<p>On to what I bought!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>E is For Estranged by Owen Pallett</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t discover Owen Pallett from Spotify (my ex introduced me to him) but I did discover this song on Spotify! Even though the storyline of the song doesn&rsquo;t relate to me at all, I associate this song with myself as my name starts with E. There&rsquo;s something incredibly nostalgic about this song with a dash of good old melancholy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Icarus, Bint Elkhandaq, and Maghawir by Mashrou&rsquo; Leila</strong></p>

<p>When I used to be obsessed with TCGs, I was inspired for a couple of months to make a TCG of my own: an Asian music inspired TCG. Except I was determined to include Asian countries that weren&rsquo;t just Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. On my search, I came across Lebanese based alternative band Mashrou&rsquo; Leila. They were more secular than I expected with songs covering topics such as homosexuality, clubbing, and politics but I mostly fell in love with their catchy tunes! Their latest album (which all three of these song are from) is a bit more on the poppy side but I honestly love the entire album so just picking a few songs to buy was difficult.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Let Me Go! feat. Sophie Hunger by Erik Truffaz 4tet</strong></p>

<p>I stumbled onto this song purely by chance, thanks to Mashrou&rsquo; Leila. The lead singer of Mashrou&rsquo; Leila performed a cover of this song from Erik Truffaz 4tet. I was enchanted by it and hurried to listen to the original. Hearing it being sung in English hit me hard. Sophie Hunger has a perfect voice for this song. It has a sense of longing to break free that she captures perfectly.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Paris is Burning and All My Stars Aligned by St. Vincent</strong></p>

<p>I had heard of St. Vincent before but wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what she was about. I <em>think</em> she came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify one day and and according to my Last.fm, it was most likely <strong>Paris is Burning</strong>. The song was unbelievably quirky and I fell in love instantly. It took me a couple of months to listen to the rest of the <strong>Marry Me</strong> album and <strong>All My Stars Aligned</strong> was one of the songs that resonated with me. It was an obvious jab at people who turn to superstitions (astrology, palm reading, etc.) which I sometimes dabble in but I loved it so much. Also St. Vincent is an absolutely beautiful human being.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Human Sadness by Julian Casablancas + The Voidz</strong></p>

<p>This song I know for sure came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify. I had been listening to some of Julian&rsquo;s tracks from his solo album <strong>Phrazes for the Young</strong> for a bit up to that point. When I heard <strong>Human Sadness</strong>, it hit all the right buttons with me and I knew I had to know more about this Julian dude. Long 10 minute epic? Check. Grungy lo-fi vibe? Check. Cool guitar riffs? Check. Depressing song title? Check. Depressing song lyrics? Check. Although once I learned the lyrics, some of the impact the song had on me was a little reduced but there are some gems. &ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s a skull, I think it&rsquo;s grinning&rdquo; is one of them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>You Only live Once by The Strokes</strong></p>

<p>The original YOLO. Okay, when I found out Julian Casablancas was the lead singer of The Strokes, my mind was blown. I immediately dived in head first into their music after finding this out. Okay, I&rsquo;m still on their first album and last EP but there is a lot to digest. <del>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, part of the reason why I love this song is because Julian is so damn beautiful in the music video.</del> Something about this song makes me want to get up and dance, strangely enough. I also can&rsquo;t resist singing along to this song. It&rsquo;s so British rock that I would have totally thought they were British if I didn&rsquo;t know any better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Songs that I totally want to buy next time:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cool by Gwen Stefani</strong></p>

<p>I went through a really weird and brief Gwen Stefani phase earlier in the year. I don&rsquo;t know how it came about. I remember seeing this music video on Much Music and dismissing it as Gwen acting all sexy in a luxurious mansion but now what I get from it is that Gwen is gorgeous is a brunette. Okay, I did get more out of it. It&rsquo;s actually quite a mature song when I think about it. It takes a lot to look back at a past relationship (that first love you thought that you would marry, at that) and fully accept that you&rsquo;ve both moved on while still being close friends. I&rsquo;m a bit of a romantic in that way, I guess.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Cruel by St. Vincent</strong></p>

<p>My love for this woman is neverending. The guitar solo isn&rsquo;t long at all but it&rsquo;s the highlight of the song, in my opinion. I love how St. Vincent tackles the subject of the unappreciated parental figure. Also, props to St. Vincent for using gender neutral language (she refers to this unappreciated person as &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; throughout the song).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Galaxy by LADIES&rsquo; CODE</strong></p>

<p>This song is sexy. I can&rsquo;t say more about it, unfortunately, haha! This is a Korean girl group which I found on Spotify, which is a little rare for me. I like this song a lot.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Utada Hikaru&rsquo;s new album!!!!!!!</strong></p>

<p>I was tempted to spend all $10 on this album but I decided against it as the songs I&rsquo;ve listened to on the album I already own. I want a more concrete opinion of the album before I buy it. The teaser for the Shiina Ringo collaboration was so tempting. But I like making informed buying decisions. I know I won&rsquo;t be disappointed since it&rsquo;s Utada Hikaru, but still.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unrequited Love by CAPSULE</strong></p>

<p>While on my latest trip to the Philippines, I listened to <em>WAVE</em> <em>RUNNER</em> multiple times on the plane there. A lot of people complain about how Western the album is. EDM and dubstep is horrible. Toshiko doesn&rsquo;t sing much. Blah, blah, blah&hellip; I personally found the album to be pretty good. Honestly, I dismiss comments that complain of foreign music being &ldquo;too Western.&rdquo; In my mind it implies a weird exoticizing take on foreign music. Anyway, I really like this song, despite not being heavy into electronic music. Toshiko has great lines.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls by The Weekend</strong></p>

<p>The earlier works of The Weekend are intoxicating. Seriously, The Weekend&rsquo;s super clean vocals mixed with the heavy beats make for songs that make you feel like you&rsquo;re on a trip (is that how the kids say it nowadays). This song is just intoxicating in a seductive way.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Primadonna by Marina and the Diamonds</strong></p>

<p>Marina is HOT. Her Electra Heart era reawakened my hidden feelings for Vanessa Hudgens (you can&rsquo;t deny that Marina looks at least a little like Vanessa!). But yeah, there&rsquo;s something really attractive about her Electra Heart persona. It&rsquo;s a shame that she doesn&rsquo;t view the era as a great period in her career because I love it. Primadonna is like a rich spoiled girl anthem and I can&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Divers by Joanna Newsome</strong></p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot about this song. Unfortunately, Joanna doesn&rsquo;t have her music on Spotify so unless I&rsquo;m on YouTube, I don&rsquo;t listen to this song. Which is a great reason why I need this song! I think I&rsquo;ve written about <em>Divers</em> before but I will reiterate once again that I am IN LOVE with Joanna. She&rsquo;s extremely polarizing. You either kiss the earth she walks on or think her voice is like nails on chalkboard. This is a masterpiece and I love her. I totally regret not buying this now. Damn, how could I forget this song?</p></li>

        <p><a href="/2016/06/security-by-obscurity/">My last post</a> was about security by obscurity and I talked a little about trying to implement security techniques into my projects. This is really great timing.</p>

<p>Last week, various online services ran by my university were down. It was really inconvenient not having access to my e-mail but I took it in stride. I figured it was just the servers acting up or malware or something like that. It turns out that <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/it/news/06072016/university-calgary-makes-significant-progress-address-systems-issues">my university was dealing with a ransomware attack</a>. I was half right. Ransomware is malware that basically holds a system hostage until a ransom is paid. My university gave into it and paid $20 000 to get the systems back.</p>

<p>Honestly, it seems to me like paying the ransom was the smart choice. Thousands of users were affected by this attack and it&rsquo;s probably costing them a lot more not having their systems than to pay the money. It&rsquo;s probably the easiest route. I haven&rsquo;t done much research on it but apparently FBI recommends this. It’s better if you don’t pay the ransom but if you’re not tech savvy or the stakes are too high (but not like top secret government stakes), it’s probably a good idea.</p>

<p>Also, personal anecdote. I&rsquo;ve had an instance of &ldquo;ransomeware.&rdquo; It was more like adware ransomware. I was browsing around and all of a sudden my screen flashed and accused me of a crime and asked me to pay a fine. I read through it several times and I froze a bit. I was innocent of the crime (of course) but I was worried that maybe it was something that could easily look like I commited it (think like authors who joke about being on some kind of list for researching murder methods for a book). But I calmly opened up my phone and looked up the message. Common ransomware. So I safely ignored it. Thank goodness because the amount they were asking was easily ten times more than what&rsquo;s in my bank account.</p>

        <h4>Jun 7, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/security-by-obscurity/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Last semester I took an introductory course to information security. One of the concepts we touched on was &ldquo;security by obscurity.&rdquo; Basically what that means is if no one is aware of something, they can&rsquo;t possibly break into it. For example, hiding your diary is a form of security by obscurity. Of course, this has it flaws. There is always the possibility that someone could somehow stumble upon your diary by accident. There might people actively looking for something valuable to you but they won&rsquo;t know what it is until they find it. Notice I didn&rsquo;t mention &ldquo;if&rdquo; they find it. It&rsquo;s always a good practice to assume that they will find it. This is one of the reasons why security by obscurity is not ideal.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I use security by obscurity. The diary analogy I used was something that I actually do. Now, my mom loves to poke around and I still live with her. She has read my diaries in the past so it&rsquo;s not far-fetched that she would find my diary one day and read it. This is why I don&rsquo;t use it as my only form of security. My journal entries are either about really mundane stuff or encrypted with <a href="http://www.ccelian.com/concepca.html">Elian script</a>. So unless my mother is good at cracking ciphers (which I highly doubt as English is her second language and frequency analysis is probably lost on her), I can safely assume that my secrets are safe with me.</p>

<p>The reason why I suddenly started thinking about this is because I have a project that I&rsquo;ve been working on. I&rsquo;ve been trying to build a book management script. Right now I&rsquo;m just finishing up simple features for the admin panel such as tagging a book, adding a review to a book, editing author names, etc. All of this is currently in a folder with an obscure name. At first I thought that if my admin folder wasn&rsquo;t named something obvious like &ldquo;admin,&rdquo; I would less likely have a security breach. Who would want to hack my tiny and unpopular websites anyway? Then I realized, wait, that&rsquo;s a really bad idea.</p>

<p>Curious, I looked up if there was a way to discover folders that were not explicitly linked publically. I was not surprised when I saw that such a way does indeed exist. In fact, there are several ways (or programs) to do this. Software like <a href="https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/discover-hidden-directories-and-files">URL Fuzzer</a> and <a href="http://git.kali.org/gitweb/?p=packages/dirbuster.git;a=summary">DirBuster</a> utilize a method called fuzzing. In my introductory class, we would classify this as a brute force method. What fuzzing does is try any possible number of combinations in order to find a weakness. In this case, it tries to find out if a folder exists. Specifically, DirBuster goes through a list of words (have not checked if it includes random strings or just common words) and appends them to a URL. Depending on the HTTP status code (things like 404 not found or 403 forbidden), it can determine if a folder exists on the website or not.</p>

<p>So, knowing this, I could still use security by obscurity. However, like my diary, I plan to implement other layers of security. Whether or not it will increase security or just give it security it didn’t have in the first place, I’m not sure (entropy wasn&rsquo;t my strong point in my information security course). But I am sure that leaving it as a randomly named folder is not the way to go. I know how to do simple PHP sessions with a login but only with matching the submitted password with a plaintext password in a database. That&rsquo;s a whole other realm of security issues so I&rsquo;m going to start reading up on hashing passwords in PHP. I&rsquo;ve poked around some open source scripts and have found MD5 hash functions so that&rsquo;s probably what I&rsquo;m aiming for. Honestly, I&rsquo;m not well-versed in web security specifically (other than SQL injections are bad and you have to sanitize them) but that’s why I’m still learning.</p>

<p>So the next time you think you’re just going to hide something and think you’ll be fine, you probably will be but it’s better if you combine it with some other security technique especially if it contains sensitive information.</p>

<p><strong>5 subnets are needed.</strong> If you look at the topology, there are 4 LANs (coloured in orange) and 1 serial connection between Building1 and Building2. Therefore, you need 5 subnets.</p>

<h4 id="a-name-1-2-a-step-2-determine-the-subnet-mask-information-for-each-subnet"><a name="1-2"></a>Step 2: Determine the subnet mask information for each subnet.</h4>

<p>The original subnet mask of the network address is 255.255.255.0. This comes from the prefix length /24, which indicates that there are 24 bits set in the subnet mask. We will use this as the basis for subnetting.</p>

<p><strong>192.168.72.0/26.</strong> The largest LAN is ASW-4 with 58 hosts. Subnet 192.168.72.0/24 into 192.168.72.0/26. This will give us 4 subnets ((2^2 = 4)) with 64 hosts per subnet.</p>

<p>The subnets are:</p>

<ul>
<li>192.168.72.0</li>
<li>192.168.72.64</li>
<li>192.168.72.128</li>
<li>192.168.72.192</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the subnets each contain 64 hosts, simple add 64 to the last octet. This method will not be as feasible for subnets with a large number of hosts. Another way is to convert everything to binary. Only the first 2 bits will change while the rstrongaining 6 bits stay the same.</p>
