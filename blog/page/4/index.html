        <p>It&rsquo;s my boyfriend&rsquo;s birthday coming up soon. I wanted to make him a knitted or a crocheted item because I need something to keep my hands busy. Plus aren&rsquo;t handmade things the sweetest thing you could get as a present??</p>

<p>On some level, I know he&rsquo;s a little picky about what kind of things he would like to wear. To avoid spending a ton of time working on something that he might not ever wear, I sent him a couple links to patterns of scarves and toques. I may have added a few slouchy beanies in the list of links because I think he would look really good in a slouchy beanie. Lo and behold, out of all the links I sent him, he liked the one non-slouchy beanie the most. I&rsquo;m not annoyed or anything but I am pretty amused. I love little moments like these.</p>

<p>To be honest, there are a ton of projects that I should be working on instead of thinking of this (to name a few, school assignments). However this is one of those things that I call a &ldquo;productive distraction.&rdquo; Writing this blog post is a productive distraction in itself.</p>

<p>I even had a productive distraction between thinking that I needed to write this post and actually starting to write it. I was originally planning to write only a short paragraph. Then I wondered if I should separate long form blog posts with my status-like blog posts. I turned to <a href="https://jack.baty.net">Jack Baty</a> for some inspiration. I really admire the web presence that Jack has and I like his gutso for mixing microblogging with regular blogging. The stream of consciousness approach is something that I really would like to emulate.</p>

<p>So I went to his website. Then I found myself on a couple of other websites. Now I have more things on my to-do list.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with Hugo lately. A couple of weeks ago, I exported my old Wordpress blog into Hugo. While I am happy with the results, it&rsquo;s taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I&rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.</p>

<p>So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site. A new GitHub repository.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see how Hugo + Github works out. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be here to stay (fingers crossed that Github Pages is still a thing until my deathbed).</p>

        <p>I follow the blog <a href="http://baty.net">baty.net</a> in which Jack Baty continuously finds new tools and new ways to improve his productivity. While I usually scoff at people who are always changing things up, I will admit that I am the exact same way. It would be great to just stick to something tried and true and never have to think about changing but there is just so much out there that it&rsquo;s hard for me to resist the temptation to not try everything I can see. I have gone through <a href="https://filofax.com">Filofaxes</a>, <a href="http://bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a>-esque planners, Google Calendar, regular paper agendas, post it notes, back to Bullet Journals, etc.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Bullet Journals&rdquo; and Paper Planners</strong></p>

<p>In it&rsquo;s simplest state, the Bullet Journal is an analog system for rapid logging. You have a thought or task, you write it down, and (hopefully) come back to it later to deal with it. Without a few tweaks, it&rsquo;s not the greatest for future planning. It&rsquo;s real use case is capturing at the moment. I have tried both minimalistic Bullet Journal and all out &ldquo;unrecognizable as a Bullet Journal&rdquo; planning and I found it too hard to keep up with and check on regularly, especially with the latter. I would write something down and never look at it again or I would be too daunted with drawing out daily/weekly/monthly layouts.</p>

<p>For a period I did somewhat automate dealing with layouts by printing a whole year during my Winter break. I would meticulously design a layout in Photoshop, export it to a PDF, print it, cut it, and punch holes. It was a lot of effort for a system that I only ended up using for a couple of months but when I did use it, it worked well for me.</p>

<p>I also had success with store bought planners. My second year of university I used a planner for the entire year. However when the school year ended, I was bored with the system and wanted to try something new. I was lured in by the Filofax craze and fantasized about using a planner that could also be my wallet. Even now as I look at the Filofax website after not visiting it for so long, I&rsquo;m drooling over the pretty planners (someone please take my wallet away from me). However that was even more short lived and I converted my would be planner-wallet into just a wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Google Calendar</strong></p>

<p>What I loved about Google Calendar was seeing my entire week at a glance down to the last hour. However, the way I used it, it was unsustainable and lacked the detail I needed. While it was easy to change things around, sometimes an unexpected event would throw off my entire day and a result, throw me off from my productivity. Taking away time from something else gave me a little bit of an existential crisis that I didn&rsquo;t have with other productivity systems.</p>

<p>Still, it was great getting those notifications and being able to sync across device and basically have my entire life without me wherever I go. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten my phone at home for many years now and I recently got data in my phone plan and a rechargeable battery pack so it really is with me <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. Eventually though, I just stopped using it and went for a while without using any sort of productivity system at all.</p>

<p><strong>Org mode</strong></p>

<p>As I have mentioned before, <a href="/blog/programming/tempted-by-static-pages-again/">I recently started using emacs</a> and got sucked into the world of Org mode. The customizability of Org mode excites me and I love having everything in plain text and available at the terminal. Like Google Calendars, it&rsquo;s pretty much with me everywhere I go, with the help of Dropbox and SSH-ing into my private server. I love the task and habit functions built in and while it was daunting to learn at first, I quickly got the hang of it.</p>

<p>So, for now, I am using Org mode. It&rsquo;s working well for me but who knows what ship I&rsquo;ll jump onto next? Maybe one day I will find the one that works for me until the end of time but I doubt it.</p>

        <blockquote>
<p><strong>FO</strong> stands for &ldquo;finished object.&rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.</p>

<p>I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on <a href="https://pattern-paradise.com/2016/09/26/free-crochet-pattern-alpine-nights-beanie/">Alpine Nights</a> because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty. It also came with a child sizing which was perfect.</p>

<p>The yarn I used was Red Heart Super Saver in Candy Print. My cousin&rsquo;s daughter specifically requested pink and I figured this would be quite a cute colour combination and not too boring if it was just one solid colour.</p>

<p>It took a couple of hours for me to finish it. The pattern is very straight forward. I made a mistake in not turning (switching direction) every row so I had to restart a couple of times. I did make it a couple of rows shorter than the pattern specified because it was getting a little bit too big.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it. Even though I made it shorter, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s still big for my cousin&rsquo;s daughter. Since it seems like she grows each time I see her, I hope it would be okay for her to grow into it. We&rsquo;ll see if she likes it as much as I do!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion. Her passive rebellion manifests in ever more bizarre and frightening forms, leading her bland husband to self-justified acts of sexual sadism. His cruelties drive her towards attempted suicide and hospitalisation. She unknowingly captivates her sister&rsquo;s husband, a video artist. She becomes the focus of his increasingly erotic and unhinged artworks, while spiralling further and further into her fantasies of abandoning her fleshly prison and becoming &#8211; impossibly, ecstatically &#8211; a tree.</p>

<p>Fraught, disturbing and beautiful, The Vegetarian is a novel about modern day South Korea, but also a novel about shame, desire and our faltering attempts to understand others, from one imprisoned body to another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember one time I participated in a blog hop where one of the prompts mentioned seeking out diverse voices, usually cultural. I was a little shocked that a lot of people said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seek it out or make a point to find authors with a different point of view from mine.&rdquo; I think there is a lot of different voices out there that you need to seek out because their voices need to be heard.</p>

<p>One of my friends started up a book club, #milliesbookclub, that would explore Asian American authors and their works. Being Asian American myself (Asian Canadian to be exact), I was extremely interested. For minorities, it can be easy to have your voice drowned out. In general, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the literature industry regardless but it seemed important to intentionally seek out these Asian American authors. So out of this book club, <em>The Vegetarian</em> was chosen.</p>

<p>My first impression of this novel was that it was extremely Murakami-esque. Haruki Murakami almost always features peculiar women and these women almost always serve as some sort of motivator for the male protagonists. Murakami is frequently accused to using the manic pixie dream girl trope again and again and it was a little bit disappointing to see this again in another Asian author.</p>

<p>The male characters in this book were no different from how Murakami portrays his male characters. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s brother-in-law is obsessed with her to the point of his destroying his marriage and taking advantage of her mental vulnerability. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s husband forces himself upon her and selfishly only thinks of how her antics affect him. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s father was abusive to her for her entire life, even displaying physical aggression towards her in her adult life. It&rsquo;s no wonder that Yeong-hye retreats inward and pursues the notion that becoming a tree would bring the ultimate state of nirvana.</p>

<p>While I did find Yeong-hye&rsquo;s passion a little ridiculous and self destructive, I have finally come to the conclusion (with a little bit of help) that it boiled down to a form of escapism and served as a great foil to Yeong-hye&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>It maybe be obvious that Yeong-hye wasn&rsquo;t so keen on the life that she lived due to all of the not-so-great males she had around her. I still don&rsquo;t see the significance in becoming a tree but I do love how this demonstrates a positive attribute that Yeong-hye possesses which her sister does not.</p>

<p>Despite everything, Yeong-hye is true to herself. Compared to her sister, she is not a subservient and too obedient woman who is too polite to the point of irritation. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s brother-in-law makes this observation as he wonders why his wife would not lash out at him for his absenteeism in the family and instead becomes a little bit too accommodating. This is also shown when Yeong-hye&rsquo;s sister has a strong sense of duty towards her son which keeps her from succumbing to her depression whereas Yeong-hye is eager to let go of what little life she has left regardless of her obligations. Yeong-hye is more willing to break conventions as she only answers to herself.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, most of the other members of the book club didn&rsquo;t like this novel. I can see why. The male characters are disgusting and abhorrent. The fragile and subservient Asian woman stereotype is tiring. It&rsquo;s a frustrating read that reminds you that society is pretty much still patriarchal and misogynistic. It isn&rsquo;t empowering in the slightest, one of the aims the book club was created to begin with. Honestly, it&rsquo;s the last book that I would ever thing Millie would like to read. However, there was something fascinating about this book that never let me put it down until I finished.</p>

<p>I became invested in Yeong-hye and her sister. I could have skipped all the sections about Yeonh-hye&rsquo;s husband and brother-in-law easily. These two women wronged by the most important men in their lives struck a chord with me. The book made me want to know what became of the two sisters and how they could possibly rebuild their lives. I wanted to know what really went on their minds while we saw their husband&rsquo;s points of view and who they really were behind who the men thought they were.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think Han Kang made the right choice using male narrators for a good portion of the book because it really painted an accurate picture of the situation. However, it feels like she barely scratched the surface with the female characters but there was some sort of sense of redemption for the female characters.</p>

<p>If you can look past the social undertones in the book, I think it would be a good read. Most reviews I&rsquo;ve seen focused on the oddity and weirdness of the situation and less on the characters, which is fine but you&rsquo;ll never know how you feel about the book until you read it for yourself.</p>
