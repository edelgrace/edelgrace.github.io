</center></p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve been in a really &ldquo;bookish&rdquo; mood lately. Mostly because I&rsquo;ve been working on getting my <a href="http://books.scattered.me">book database</a> up and running. I was pretty nostalgic over the idea of &ldquo;book blogs&rdquo; and my unsuccessful attempt at <a href="http://books.mazohyst.org">a book blog</a> still haunts me today. I decided: I shall blog about books. Book reviews will belong in my book database but anything else will go here. So what exactly is a book blog post that isn&rsquo;t a review? Memes, of course.</p>

<p>A meme who&rsquo;s concept resonates deeply with me, &ldquo;book boyfriends&rdquo; or as I like to call them: crushes on fictional people (because screw heteronormativity and cissexism).</p>

<p>So, my fictional crush for the week is:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
  <strong>Oshima from Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami</strong>
</p>

<p><center>
  <img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kafka.png" alt="kafka" width="189" height="284" class="img-responsive" />
</center></p>

<p>Some fan-art of Oshima that I mostly agree with (links because I don&rsquo;t have the patience to ask for permission from the artists): <a href="http://rittlerion.com/profpics/oshima.png">Lisa Ito</a>, <a href="http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lw59v5xs7X1qjd1kgo1_500.gif">Unknown pixiv artist</a>, <a href="http://s82.photobucket.com/user/kingrei/media/junk/oshima.png.html">Unknown artist</a>.</p>

<p>This week, I only read three books<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-9166">1</a></sup> and to be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t liking my choices! Two out of three books had characters I was indifferent about/loathed (especially the men, oh god, <em>especially</em> the men).</p>

<p>Except, for one. Oshima.</p>

<p>Oshima is a character who works at a small privately owned library. That&rsquo;s a total turn on for sure. How many guys work at libraries?</p>

<p>Anyway, Oshima acts as a mentor for the main character, Kafka. Oshima is instantly helpful towards Kafka, who is a teenage runaway. He provides temporary shelter for Kafka, gives him a job, comforts him when he feels lost. At times, it&rsquo;s like Oshima goes to the ends of the earth for Kafka, a kid whom he had only known for a week. That, is admirable. Most people would call the cops or tell Kafka to scram. Not Oshima. He recognizes Kafka&rsquo;s running away as an act of finding himself and not as a petty rebellious phase.</p>

<p>Paired with his compassion, is his intellect. Of course, being a library assistant at a library, he is incredibly well read and has a thirst for knowledge. Definitely my kind of guy. He quotes from Greek myths and discusses different philosophers and tries to explain things in lengthy monologues. Half of what he says though, does seem like a bunch of non-sense that I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around (that&rsquo;s Murakami&rsquo;s style though). Still, you can&rsquo;t help be impressed.</p>

<p>There is one scene where Oshima slams down a pair of cissexist feminists, which I totally cheered at<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-9166">2</a></sup>. Although I don&rsquo;t really agree with his conception of feminism, at least we can agree that cissexism sucks and he gets extra kudos for that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this goes against him or not but Oshima is such a hipster. Totally a hipster. Who listens to Schubert? Let me rephrase: what 21 year old male who doesn&rsquo;t play an instrument listens to Schubert? Heck, even I don&rsquo;t listen to Schubert<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-9166">3</a></sup>. Plus, he&rsquo;s knowledgeable about Schubert and can analyze his works and oh goodness, it&rsquo;s all so attractive.</p>

<p>Lastly, it seems that Oshima is indeed physically attractive. Upon meeting Oshima for the first time, Kafka thinKs that he is a girl. I know feminine boys aren&rsquo;t for everyone, but I&rsquo;m not picky about looks. He wears glasses, just the way I like them (wow, I feel shallow). He is young, early 20s, 21 if I recall correctly. That amplifies everything I said about him by tenfold.</p>

<p>Now, would I actually get along with him and him with me? Probabaly not. Thank goodness it&rsquo;s just a book crush.</p>

        <p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: Mild The Fault in Our Stars spoilers (Disclaimer: I didn&rsquo;t like the movie)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I saw <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> yesterday and I knew Gus was a jock but it never really occurred to me HOW MUCH of a jock he was. He is such a typical jock. Everything about his character made sense as soon as I realized this.</p>

<p>I only cried once and it was for like a minute and it was during the part where Hazel’s parents were like, &ldquo;It’s ok, our lives will still go on when you&rsquo;re gone&rdquo; because parental moments always hit hard with me. watching this movie has made me want to meet someone who will call me &ldquo;Edel grace&rdquo; again. I’m waiting for literally anyone to be like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your full name?? Okay, I’m calling you by your first and middle name now.&rdquo; Also, woah, Shailene Woodley is Amy from The Secret Life of the American Teenager??? Hair and makeup makes a huge difference.</p></li>

<li><p>I bought myself a 3DS and my brother overwrote my save for Pokemon X. I was only two hours into it anyway but now I have to wait for him to &ldquo;finish&rdquo; the game before I can play. I understand why Pokemon only has one save slot (basically, to make money off families with more than one kid) but at the same time, I don’t want to buy another copy because I&rsquo;m so broke now, haha. Also I’m like 34 hours into Bravely Default. I LOVE it.</p></li>

<li><p>So i went to EB Games today to buy GTA 5 for my brother because it&rsquo;s ~$15 cheaper to buy it used and with my Edge card but I FORGOT I LOOK LIKE 12 and I got carded. I don’t have an ID card or my license yet. So I walked back home to get my passport and it took like 2 hours but it’s ok because I got some exercise. According to my 3DS I walked 12k steps today. Normally I walk like 500.</p></li>

<li><p>There&rsquo;s these two guys in my math class who ALWAYS stare in my general direction every single day. The seating arrangement is kind of in a U shape and I sit at the back of the U and they sit in the front and it’s just like&hellip; What are you looking at?? There’s no clock behind me, it’s just a wall??? Is it because I caught you staring that you continue to stare? I know I&rsquo;m super weird and I kinda talk too loud to my friend sometimes but why you gotta be staring me down in the middle of class??</p></li>

<li><p>I went to see The Giver and I saw the trailer of that one movie with Miyavi in it (the one where a soldier gets captured by the Japanese forces) and I freak out. I was like, &ldquo;That guy seems familiar&hellip; Is that&hellip; G-Dragon?? Nah&hellip; Wait, I remember reading something about someone being in a Hollywood movie&hellip; MIYAVI??&rdquo; Okay but WHY are asians always the evil antagonist?? I know this is based on a true story but come on. I still want to see it though.<br />
But The Giver was not a bad movie. I liked it. Whenever Jonas received memories of the past, I teared up a bit. Like, wow humanity is SO beautiful but at the same time terrible but so beautiful.</p></li>

        <p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was listening to an episode of a certain podcast yesterday, which was recorded around the time when Andy got a tumblr and started stirring the pot with the SJ fan community. Dylan was trying to steer away the conversation from using ableism terms and Barb told Dylan that he had &ldquo;So much to learn about the world.&rdquo; That made me legitimately angry and sad because I really love Barb but no, you also have a lot to learn too. I wish I could be that blissfully and purposefully ignorant of all the problematic things that are going on in this world.</li>
<li>Sometimes I wish there were &ldquo;readme for newbies&rdquo; version for 99% of the readme files on GitHub because I’m really not that great at reading documentation and most readme files assume that I already know something but I don&rsquo;t and I never know what it is that I should know because I don’t know it in the first place.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m watching FMA again because I still haven&rsquo;t watched Brotherhood. The only thing that might disappoint me about Brotherhood is that I think L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel isn’t on the soundtrack. Like FMA was THE reason why I listen to Japanese music today and I would be a whole different person if it wasn&rsquo;t for FMA and L&rsquo;Arc.<br />
Remember in media studies class I wrote an essay about FMA and my teacher read it out loud because she thought it was so good hahahaha good thing 90% of the class were my friends.</li>

<li><p>During one of my calculus lectures, we had just finished solving a problem and a girl asked my prof, &ldquo;What does this number mean?&rdquo; and my prof replied with, &ldquo;It means nothing. It’s just a number.&rdquo; The girl was getting all flustered but then my prof goes on to say, &ldquo;YOU are the ones who give it meaning. You are the chemists and computer scientists. I just give you the tools for you to use in your major.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To be honest, this is high school math in a nut shell. People go on about how high school math is useless because they&rsquo;ll never need to integrate a curve but of course math will be useless to you if you don’t apply it appropriately. Ok, most people probably won’t need to know how to find the gradient of a vector if you’re a plumber or a lawyer but math IS useful in many fields. The math you learn in high school builds a foundation of skills for you if you ever need to take higher math which WILL more than likely be used in a way that will be helpful to you.</p>

<p>I just really love this calc prof. I’ve had him twice and he&rsquo;s hands down one of my favourite profs at this university so far.</p></li>

<li><p>One time I went to park with my cousin who&rsquo;s 8 and I was pushing him on the swing and he practically yelled, &ldquo;Do one big ass push!!!&rdquo; Of course, a parent nearby just gave us the death stare and I didn’t say anything but I think I should have said something like, &ldquo;Cousin, watch your language!&rdquo; I’m going to be a horrible parent if I ever become one.</p></li>

        <p>I&rsquo;m now in my third year of university. That&rsquo;s an extremely scary thought for me, haha. High school seems like it was just yesterday (to be fair, it was only two years ago). Despite this being my third year, this is technically my middle year. I switched majors which added year to my degree. I&rsquo;ve already done two years and after I finish this year, I have two more years to go. So here I am: at the half way point.</p>

<p>The first week&hellip; Could have gone better, I guess? On the first day, I had a brutally long break in between my first and last class (4 hours!!) due to there being no tutorials in the first week. I also fell down the busiest staircase on campus. Okay, I didn&rsquo;t fall down the stairs as in actually going down the stairs but I fell down <strong>on</strong> the stairs. My legs felt like they were frozen and I couldn&rsquo;t move them so I sat there for a couple of minutes while one of my classmates stood by awkwardly. Yeah, that was embarassing. My legs still hurt from that&hellip; My calves kill me whenever I go up and down stairs!</p>

<p>My classes this year are okay, so far. I&rsquo;m taking an Arabic language class. I&rsquo;m pretty excited and completely nervous over learning a new language. I think the Arabic writing system is beautiful and I think it would be nice to learn some of the culture associated with Arabic as well. We didn&rsquo;t really start learning anything until Friday and to be honest, it was so intimidating! There are a couple of people in my class that already have some knowledge of Arabic and I feel like I&rsquo;m already behind! We were going over letter combinations, trying to pronounce them and we were going around the class. Some people said the word even before I had time to figure out what the first two letters sounded like! My confidence level seriously deflated, haha. But I&rsquo;ll give it until the end of the week before I decide if I want to stay in the class.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also in a first year statistics course and it&rsquo;s amusing seeing the freshman trying to figure things out on the first day. My professor has a super strong accent, which can be off-putting for some, but hopefully we&rsquo;ll just get used to it. To be honest, I think I&rsquo;m already used to it!</p>

<p>In one of my computer science courses, I have a professor that I&rsquo;ve previously had before. There&rsquo;s a lot of weird coincidences with this class! When I first took it with her, the course number was 231 and the section I was in was T05-1. Now, the course number is 331 and the section I&rsquo;m in is T01-5! If you follow my Twitter, you might have already seen me make this observation, haha.</p>

<p>This professor loves group work and she&rsquo;s pretty creative in constructing the course. We were given a survey of sorts to take while she took the results and put us in groups according to our answers. So far I like my group! They all seem very friendly and hard workers. I hate group work but sometimes it can be a blessing, I guess.</p>

<p>One of the good things that happened this week was that my friend gave me a little gift he brought from his trip to Hong Kong and the Philippines! He bought me a Mayday CD from Hong Kong. They&rsquo;re a super cool Taiwanese band and I&rsquo;m pretty much in love with the lead singer. It&rsquo;s a live concert/movie soundtrack CD. They&rsquo;re pretty good live except sometimes the vocalist gets really nasally. Other than that, I love it!</p>

<p>Before I finish this post, I have one more observation to make. Oh my goodness, the university is so crowded! I took Spring and Summer courses (June to August) and there weren&rsquo;t many people around then. I was so used to the university being a ghost town and now that I&rsquo;m back to the regular school year, it feels like there&rsquo;s too many people. I totally prefer Spring and Summer over Fall and Winter!</p>

<p>And with that I should probably get to sleep (8 AM classes with an ~1.5 hour commute does not make a happy camper). Let&rsquo;s hope for a good week!</p>

        <p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was mailing out letters one day and there&rsquo;s this guy at the mall who works at a knives store. He has a sweet mohawk. I was sitting nearby putting stamps on envelopes and an old lady asked him if she could touch his hair. It was kinda cute but at the same time I wonder if he was annoyed but he sounded really cheerful about it, so maybe not? It really made my day.</li>
<li>My biggest pet peeve in Assassin&rsquo;s Creed is when people dismiss Those Who Came Before as silly space time wizard ghosts. I can’t be the only one, right?? There much more than that! There&rsquo;s not really ghosts but holograms, in a way. Bits of their consciousness is stored as data. Think of it as a really complex AI.</li>
<li>In Mass Effect &ldquo;4&rdquo; I just want to talk more. Like, I want to learn more about different Alien cultures. I want to do nice stuff for random people, even if it’s just talking them through decisions and not going to the ends of the universe for them. For example, the little side mission with that one &ldquo;couple&rdquo; on the citadel who were debating whether or not they wanted to undergo gene therapy for the unborn child. I also want to eavesdrop on conversations. I want to hear mundane stuff like &ldquo;Did you hear about X in accounting? He’s getting married&hellip; To an ASARI.&rdquo; I want to hear game relevant stuff like &ldquo;I heard that if you go to this planet, you can get Y model of armor&rdquo; or &ldquo;there’s a rumour that Z is hiding in the W solar system.&rdquo; There are a lot of other things I want in ME4 but like&hellip; Dialogue choices!! I hope ME4 will be amazing, bioware please don’t let me down.</li>
<li>I took an ethics course and our prof was so hard on us when it came to the topic of eating meat. Every single argument we could come up with FOR eating meat, he tore them apart and exposed every single flaw in them. Then he gave his arguments AGAINST eating meat and they were so convincing and almost untouchable. I just CANNOT justify eating meat anymore but I still do it anyway. I just feel extremely guilty whenever I eat meat now.</li>
<li>When I was in elementary school I tried to make an Alyson Stoner guild on Neopets except I couldn’t say &ldquo;Alyson Stoner&rdquo; in the description because Neopets kept censoring me. It kept telling me I couldn’t use that word and at that point I was innocent enough to not know why her name was a bad word.</li>
