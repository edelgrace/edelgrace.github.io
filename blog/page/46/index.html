        <p>In a way, I don&rsquo;t want to read stories about (romantic) love anymore. Too much emphasis is put on love, whether it be on screen, in print, or just in life in general. Not that I&rsquo;m saying that love isn&rsquo;t important, because it is important. How a character approaches love can speak volumes about their personality. But I just don&rsquo;t want it to be the main plot, or even a sub-plot. I just want love to be there. Just let it happen or note that it has happened already.</p>

<p>Love drives us but it isn&rsquo;t the only thing that drives us. Sometimes it&rsquo;s survival, sometimes it&rsquo;s the desire for status, sometimes it&rsquo;s our family, and sometime&rsquo;s it just not love.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hear different stories. I want to hear stories of personal struggles that do not revolve around not being able to get laid. I&rsquo;m not invalidating those struggles but I am tired of hearing it, of seeing it, and of reading it. I want to hear adventures in faraway lands that may or may not be real. I want to hear tales of fantasy. I want to experience something more than just love.</p>

<p>I guess all it boils down to is that love is overrated and while important, it&rsquo;s still not as important as we think it is.</p>

        <p><strong>Warning: Suicide content warning.</strong></p>

<p>My philosophy with this blog has always been to approach in a very casual and informal way. I was inspired by a blog to do so, but I don&rsquo;t quite remember what site it was exactly (I&rsquo;m tempted to say it was <a href="http://6birds.net">6birds</a>, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure). I try to have this mindset whenever I need to write a blog post. Even so, I don&rsquo;t entirely feel free in writing whatever I want.</p>

<p>In a way, I guess my layout at the moment is pretty intimidating for me. I kinda feel like I have to write a lot just to make one paragraph more than 3 lines. Not to mention that there are people out there who have screens that are way bigger than mine, so the stuff that I write must look extremely tiny to them<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-786">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Also, Tumblr is still a problem for me. I tend to publish really short thoughts of mine on Tumblr. Some of them could easily be tweets instead, while some are too long to be a tweet but still too short for an actual blog post. Nevertheless, I wish I could approach this blog as casually as I do with Tumblr. I still don&rsquo;t know what it is about Tumblr that makes me want to post every single detail of my life.</p>

<p>But I guess I should write a life update or something?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently on semester break and cherishing every single moment of nothingness because I&rsquo;ll be taking spring semester and summer semester courses. It&rsquo;s crazy, I know. But like, I&rsquo;m extremely determined to graduate in 2016, even though it looks like it&rsquo;ll be impossible. I can get all of my options done right away but the computer science department doesn&rsquo;t offer courses during the spring and summer so there&rsquo;s no real way to get ahead. So far, I&rsquo;ll graduate a semester later than I want.</p>

<p>On a different note, I&rsquo;m working on a super secret project<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-786">2</a></sup> that involves a lot of Google Image searches. I may or may not have been browsing Taiji pictures and got suddenly distracted by X JAPAN feelings.</p>

<p>If you listen to Japanese rock, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to avoid the inevitable X JAPAN phase. I mostly rode that out when I was in grade ten, but I still love listening to X JAPAN today. Who is X JAPAN? Only one of the most influential and well known metal acts in Japan. They&rsquo;re crazy famous in Japan, but I&rsquo;m not so sure if that&rsquo;s still the case.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tragedy and drama surrounding the band, hence the X JAPAN feelings. X JAPAN first broke up in 1997, and a year later, one of the most loved members, hide, (allegedly) committed suicide. The impact was huge. Think Michael Jackson huge. There were a couple of copycat suicides (both successful and unsuccessful), and around 50,000 fans lined the streets on the day of his funeral.</p>

<p>I remember reading interviews with the drummer, Yoshiki, about the grief he felt and still felt years after. I don&rsquo;t remember the site anymore, but there are a few (barely accurate) quotes that I remember from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine myself in my thirties. When I was younger, my father committed suicide. He was 33. I could never imagine myself older than my father. It just so happened that hide was the same age&hellip; 33.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason, that really cut deep. A small, simple, and hopefully innocent coincidence that could really tear a person apart. Gosh, and then Yoshiki goes to say things that just hurt for some reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never imagined that end for him, I thought it would be me.</p>

<p>If I had never formed this band, if I had never met him, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine the guilt he must have felt. But I feel like the one who felt the most responsible was Toshi. Toshi initiated the disbandonment of the band in the first place, because he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t properly balance his solo activities with X JAPAN activities. In another interview with Yoshiki, he recalls calling the band members to discuss Toshi leaving the band. The first thing hide said was, &ldquo;But what will become of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yoshiki couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of having a band without Toshi (all of the songs were written solely for Toshi&rsquo;s voice), but he did entertain hide in looking for a new vocalist. I think they both knew it would be impossible for X to come back without Toshi.</p>

<p>Recently, I just watched their reunion video<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-786">3</a></sup>, and Toshi could barely keep himself together while singing their number one love song, <em>Forever Love</em>. The crowd would sing for him as he wept and he could barely play the chords and his voice kept cracking and it was honestly really hard to watch.</p>

<p>I hope he has forgiven himself by now.</p>

<p>But the tragedy and drama doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Toshi had been involved in an alleged cult which he just recently got out of, and his wife was living with the director (?) of said cult. He divorced his wife and is brankrupt due to the swindling of the cult. Wow. That&rsquo;s some intense stuff there.</p>

<p>Around the same time, the form bassist Taiji comitted suicide. He was arrested for alleged assault while on an airplane, and he hung himself in jail. He left the band a long time ago, but X JAPAN is still frequently attached to his name. It&rsquo;s sad because it seemed like he was getting his life back together, after years of abusing drugs and alcohol.</p>

<p>But I still love this band. It&rsquo;s weird though. Watching videos and casually listening to music and suddenly thinking, &ldquo;This person doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s worse when I listen to hide&rsquo;s solo music. I hear someone incredibly innovative and risk taking and it&rsquo;s just unsettling to think of the end that came to him.</p>

<p>Life is too short.</p>

        <p>I’m still waiting to fall in love with a book. I want to open it and never want to put it down ever again. I want to find myself in it. I want it to drag out the dark from inside of me and then I want it to tell me that it’s okay and to list all the things that are good about me. I want to read it and never look at life and humanity the same way again. And not for an hour, not for day, not for a month, not for a year, but for the rest of my life. I want to be able to read it again and again and each time it will be different but each time it will become even more beautiful than before. I want it to become familiar, so familiar that I could just know the amount of times the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; appears on page 86 but every time I quote a line from memory, it will read with a new meaning.</p>

<p>I say I’m waiting to fall in love with a book but I think I’m just waiting to fall in love with a person.</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, I really want a book (an actual book) to grab me. The closest thing I&rsquo;ve come to one is <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Bronte. I love that book. I&rsquo;ve sadly only read it once but I now I feel like I should read it again.</p>

<p>Even now, the mere mention of the name &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo; evokes a pang of pain and sympathy (and no, not because of Lucy Stillman even though I do feel pain at the sound of her name but that&rsquo;s a different kind of pain).</p>

<p>Lucy is an ironic name. &ldquo;Light,&rdquo; The first thing you see in a new morning. Hope. Optimism. No, Lucy has no hope and her life is a pessimist&rsquo;s dream (or rather, nightmare). Her last name says more about her than her first: Snowe. &ldquo;Cold.&rdquo; Lifeless. But at the same time snow is white: pure and innocent.</p>

<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s entirely innocent or pure, there&rsquo;s still something beautifully naive about her. Her isolated nature brings out a sort of awkwardness. She pores herself into her books, makes believe that her unrequited love might just love her back (all the while knowing that he doesn&rsquo;t), indulges in her isolation, doesn&rsquo;t allow herself to feel true anger at the mere child who stole her unrequited love from her, reason destroys her because she feels like she is just a tool to be used by others, reason doesn&rsquo;t allow her to enjoy life because she knows there isn&rsquo;t much to enjoy, and there&rsquo;s just so much about Lucy Snowe that is beautiful.</p>

<p>And then there was that rare event when someone fell in love with her and she fell in love back. Someone who didn&rsquo;t find her as an odd girl but was in love with her Protestant quirks, her quick wit, and her abundant knowledge. They planned to get married but her lover is swept away by the sea.</p>

<p>How tragic. How utterly tragic. Lucy, there is no hope for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Me she had forgotten. I was changed too; though not, I fear, for the better. I made no attempt to recall myself to her memory: why should I?</em></p>

<p><em>I would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once into my hands, turning over the sacred yellow leaves, ascertaining the title, and perusing with my own eyes the figments which, as an unworthy heretic, it was only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears.</em></p>

<p><em>I suppose he regarded my silences as eccentric.</em></p>

<p><em>This hag, this Reason, would not let me loop up, or smile, or hope: she could not rest unless I were altogether crushed, cowed, broken-in, and broken-down. According to her, I was born only to work for a piece of bread, to await the pains of death, and steadily all life to despond. Reason might be right.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;I believe if you had been a boy, Lucy, instead of a girl &#8211; my mother&rsquo;s god-son instead of god-daughter &#8211; we should have been good friends.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;You are good, you are beautiful; but you are not mine.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;I live in solitary.&rsquo;<br />
&#8216;But solitude is sadness.&rsquo;<br />
&#8216;Yes; it is sadness. Life, however, has worse than that.&rsquo;</em></p>

        <p>Long weird sappy feelings. So much sap and cheese and this sounded better in my head because I kinda read it in a certain way. Man, I just don’t know. Also, for the love of gulay, the end of a line does not mean &ldquo;pause.&rdquo; Punctuation means &ldquo;pause.&rdquo; Yes, you’re supposed to run out of breath (I&rsquo;m kinda slightly asthmatic though, so).</p>

<p>i’m sorry,</p>

<p>but i won’t ever text you again</p>

<p>and i hope you never text me again either.</p>

<p>usually i love communication that doesn’t involve me</p>

<p>actually speaking but with you, it’s different.</p>

<p>there’s a disconnect.</p>

<p>a disconnect between you and your words, your words</p>

<p>that appear in the form of pixels</p>

<p>and not in the form of your voice</p>

<p>it just doesn’t feel like you.</p>

<p>it feels strange and foreign</p>

<p>it’s like a translator sucked away your personality</p>

<p>and in their place put in words that barely make sense</p>

<p>even though when i’m speaking to you</p>

<p>your accent is thick and heavy and</p>

<p>your words still don’t really</p>

<p>make sense to me but at least it’s you.</p>

<p>and one of my favourite things about you</p>

<p>is the way you talk.</p>

<p>you talk with your face.</p>

<p>your lips mischievously curl upwards and</p>

<p>they push out at certain syllables and</p>

<p>in moments of confusion your brows furrow and</p>

<p>your lips purse and</p>

<p>when you’re not talking, you look at me so intently</p>

<p>and so full of purpose like</p>

<p>“i’m listening to you and by god i will listen to you.”</p>

<p>even though i’m sure you’re just</p>

<p>being polite and don’t actually think that but i guess</p>

<p>you’re just that convincing.</p>

<p>and it’s weird because my anxiety is worse</p>

<p>when i’m texting you, even when just</p>

<p>the thought of talking to people face to face</p>

<p>shakes me so bad to the point where i feel like</p>

<p>i don’t want to live anymore, or</p>

<p>i don’t deserve to live anymore, or</p>

<p>i don’t even have the ability to live normally anymore.</p>

<p>and even though i feel that way before talking to you,</p>

<p>it disappears as soon as i say “hi”</p>

<p>and with others it lasts until they’re out of the room</p>

<p>and i’m in at bed at night where i pick</p>

<p>apart my words and use them to pick apart my mind</p>

<p>and i wish i knew why.</p>

<p>but i guess the point is,</p>

<p>i’m sorry.</p>

<p>but let’s never text again.</p>

<p>This was my second year going to my local con. Last year I went all three days but this year I just went one day. It was a lot of fun but also soooo exhausting!</p>

<p>It was typical weather for my city: snowing. Ugh. Gross. I got there earlier than I wanted, so I had to wait in line. In the snow. Thankfully, I wasn&rsquo;t waiting for too long! The line was so much faster than last year. Instead of walking around the building to the front entrance, they just let us in through the back doors. Less time waiting outside and less time spent walking outside is fine with me. The line itself was also a lot more organized. They split up the line into more lines instead of making arbitrary groups as the line moved. It was a lot more faster that way. Thank goodness!</p>

<!--more Read the rest of my con shenanigans!-->

<p>I went with two friends of mine and their friends. It was a lot of fun! My friend, P, dressed up as Petra from the anime <em>Shingeki no Kyojin</em>. She was the only one who cosplayed. She didn&rsquo;t get a lot of people asking for pictures and she actually enjoyed it that way. I think it&rsquo;s because not a lot of people who go to the con don&rsquo;t pay much attention to anime. But she looked super cool anyway!</p>

<p>We parted ways soon after, and Petra and I went (semi-window) shopping! For two hours. I mostly did the shopping, haha. But I also took a lot of pictures. There were a lot of awesome cosplays, and ahhh. They were all really awesome.</p>

        Another Commander Shepard cosplayer. I had to chase down this guy and I called after him saying, "Exuse me, Commander Shepard!" and I felt a little bit like Emily Wong (a journalist in the game). It was surreal. Also it took forever for me to focus the camera and I giggled out of awkwardness (I should have explained myself, I hope he didn't think I was laughing at him...). That poor guy had to stand there for like a minute. Whoops.

It looked in focus to me in the window thingy, I'm sorry.

<p>In the middle of the day, a friend and I went to get a photo op with the lovely Jessica Nigri, a cosplayer and Internet celebrity. She also does a voice in the RWBY animated series. She was super cute and super pretty! We got to get her to sign our photo with her, and her agent didn&rsquo;t let us pay for it. What an awesome dude. He was as upbeat and cool as she was! Probably one of the highlights of my day.</p>

<p>Also, in the picture, you can see that I&rsquo;m all buddy buddy with Nigri but my friend is really far away from her. It&rsquo;s now a running joke that he and her are&hellip; Close. Haha.</p>

<p>After that, we wandered and shopped a little bit more. We ended the day with attempting to get into a panel but it was really packed so we didn&rsquo;t get in. Which was okay with me because I was about ready to pass out! And so we parted ways and went home.</p>

<p>Onto the merchandise&hellip; I spent exactly $100 dollars, including food and not including transit and coat check. My brother asked me to buy something Rooster Teeth (not happening as they are the only ones who sell their stuff and they&rsquo;re based in Texas so&hellip; Yeah&hellip;) or League of Legends. The only LoL thing I found was really basic messenger bags and they were like $40. Sorry brother, you aren&rsquo;t getting that&hellip; But I did end up buying him a Grunt POP! figure. My brother looooves the Krogans from Mass Effect and the Grunt figure was so adorable that I knew he&rsquo;d love it! When we opened up the box, my brother immediately when &ldquo;Aweeh, he&rsquo;s so cute.&rdquo; The figures are so tiny, he fit in my freakishly small hand! So. Cute. I really wanted to find a Garrus figure but was unable to do so. I think they&rsquo;re really popular because the Garrus figure is even cuter than the Grunt one, and because Garrus is like THE most loved character in Mass Effect.</p>

<p>I also bought some Homestuck merchandise. I debated getting a Scalemate plushie, but opted for the art instead. The calendar has been on my wish list ever since it came out. While I wasn&rsquo;t particularly found of the tarot cards, it was such a deal to get them. I don&rsquo;t regret it at all. I have a love for &ldquo;predicting&rdquo; things (I don&rsquo;t take it too seriously though) and with the gorgeous art and the cards, I think I&rsquo;ll have a lot of fun with them. I also kinda feel like Cardcaptor Sakura. I need to buy those (Clow Cards) next&hellip;</p>

<p>Lastly, there were a lot of cosplays that I wasn&rsquo;t able to take pictures of or didn&rsquo;t see. A moment of silence for these amazing cosplays: Sakura from Cardcaptor Sakura, Satsuki and Ryuko from Kill La Kill, my friend cosplaying Blake from RWBY, Ruby and Weiss from RWBY, dude wearing a &ldquo;People Like Grapes&rdquo; shirt, girl wearing a &ldquo;Free Edgar 2014&rdquo; sign, Kaworu and Shinji from Evangelion, countless Connors and Ezios and Edwards from Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, and Trickster Jane from Homestuck. I&rsquo;m sure there are more but I just can&rsquo;t think of them at the moment. I also wanted to meet Westy from the Mikecast but it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to randomly bump into a specific person who is not cosplaying.</p>

<p>I saw cool people and I bought cool things. Overall, it was a pretty rad day.</p>
