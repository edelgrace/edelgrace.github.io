<h3 id="day-2-abs">Day 2: Abs</h3>

<p>Today&rsquo;s workout is split into two videos. Both target your abs however they vary in difficulty. It&rsquo;s worth noting that spot reduction (focusing on working out a specific part of your body to lose fat in that one specific area) is a myth. It&rsquo;s only when your overall body fat percentage lowers that will you see results and they will be present around your whole body and not in just one area. What targeting certain areas does do is help strengthen them but fat will not necessarily be lost there specifically.</p>

<p>Anyway, the day starts off with 10 sit-ups. I have an embarrassing confession to make. I have completely forgotten how to do a sit-up! Well, I remember how it should be done, but I cannot actually do it anymore. The last time I did a sit-up was in middle school. That was nearly six years ago&hellip; Maybe it&rsquo;s because whenever we did sit-ups, we were anchored by someone holding our feet. Even then, I remember it being so hard. So instead, I did a couple of roll-ups because I can somewhat do those.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-time">Video 1: Ab Time!</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>Onto the first real workout. The first video is considerably &ldquo;easy&rdquo; (at least, compared to the second one). Cassey goes through the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> I warmed up with the roll ups but I didn&rsquo;t mind doing it yet again.</li>
<li><em>The corkscrew:</em> It&rsquo;s weird because I had a lot of trouble keeping my balance with this one. I found my hips shifting all over the place. It didn&rsquo;t get tiring but it was just plain hard to do.</li>
<li><em>Oblique dippers:</em> These are like side push-ups on one hand. They feel deceivingly easy because it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to do wrong. Cassey gives tips on how to make it harder or easier for you, depending on how you feel.</li>
<li><em>Planks:</em> The dreaded plank&hellip; I have zero strength so this was hard. Casey goes through different variations of planking.</li>
<li><em>Elbow to knee plank:</em> I&rsquo;ve actually done this exercise before, when I used to do Fitness Blender videos! For some reason, it felt especially tougher to them this time around. But I actually enjoy this move. If only I had more room in my bedroom to do it! I had move a couple of furniture around.</li>
<li><em>Knee to chest plank:</em> This is another move that I&rsquo;m familiar with, due to Fitness Blender. I never liked these and I still don&rsquo;t like them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-10-minute-ab-sculpting-workout">Video 2: 10 Minute Ab Sculpting Workout</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>The second video is &ldquo;just&rdquo; 10 minutes of ab sculpting. I found it extremely hard! At the beginning of the video, Cassey even warns you about the incoming suffering and torture she is about to put you through. Great&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Genie twist:</em> This hurt my shoulders because I kept hitting my floor hard. I also felt a little bit silly because it felt like I was just flailing on the floor, haha.</li>
<li><em>Butterfly crunch:</em> I was able to do this one, although I was a lot slower than Cassey in doing it but at least I could do it properly.</li>
<li><em>Crunch cross, straight leg crunch cross, and advanced straight crunch cross:</em> Okay. While doing these, I had to pause the video and lay on my floor for a minute or two to contemplate my life. I&rsquo;m not even exaggerating. These were the hardest moves in the entire workout for me. My neck hurt a lot doing just two in a row. Probably a sign that I was doing it wrong but still. It&rsquo;s a struggle for me to keep my shoulders off the floor. Honestly, I did just the regular crunch cross and some of the straight leg crunch cross because the more advance variations were too much for me.</li>
<li><em>V sit-up:</em> These were hard since I can&rsquo;t even do a regular sit-up but I attempted these as much as I could. I actually felt like I was more capable of doing these over the regular sit-ups except I knew I didn&rsquo;t have the exact &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape that Cassey had.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>If you think I complained a lot, you&rsquo;re right. As someone who doesn&rsquo;t do much physical activity, I struggled A LOT. I don&rsquo;t like exercise but it seems to be a necessary evil. This is a journey and hopefully it will get easier as time goes one. Maybe I just need to push myself harder. So if you can&rsquo;t take my complaining, feel free to avoid reading my fitness posts.</p>

<p>Today was so much harder than yesterday. There were a few easier moves in this day but overall, it was hard! I swore a lot under my breath. It felt like I worked harder but not necessarily better. Tomorrow I think I will put more effort on doing the workout accurately. My downside is that I tried to figure out the moves as Cassey went through the workout. So by the time I had some semblance of what to do, she moves onto the next move. Next time I&rsquo;ll pause the video and resume it when I feel ready to do so.</p>

<p>I also watch the videos on my phone and it&rsquo;s kind of hard trying to do the exercise and watch what&rsquo;s happening. Maybe I should watch them on my laptop? I could technically watch them on the TV as well but I&rsquo;d rather have the privacy of my own room while I&rsquo;m doing exercise. I think I must look silly, especially when I&rsquo;m not doing the workouts properly!</p>

<p>So today was a tough day. Tomorrow will be equally or even more harder but I&rsquo;ll just brace myself as much as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This &ldquo;review&rdquo;/blog series is NOT sponsored in any way and all opinions are entirely of my own.</p>

<p>My first post of 2016! This year I resolved to get healthier. That is, eat healthier and be more active! I&rsquo;ve been hanging out on the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/xxfitness">/r/xxfitness: Fitness for Women</a> subreddit a lot lately. Since I&rsquo;m hesitant to go to the gym, someone suggested I try <a href="http://blogilates.com">Blogilates</a>, ran by Cassey Ho. I browsed the site a bit and decided to try the <a href="http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2014/12/30/new-beginners-calendar-2-0-for-2015/">Beginner&rsquo;s Workout Calendar</a> which lasts for four weeks.</p>

<h3 id="quick-facts-about-blogilates">Quick facts about Blogilates</h3>

<ul>
<li>The majority of the content is free. Most of Cassey&rsquo;s videos are up on YouTube.</li>
<li>Subscribing to her newsletter gives you access to unique monthly workout plans.</li>
<li>There is an app, however you have to pay for her calendars but her recipes and videos are all free.</li>
<li>As far as I know, pilates is all bodyweight exercises so absolutely no equipment is needed for her videos.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-11076"><img src="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-1024x806.png" alt="blogilates-beginners-calender-2" width="1024" height="806" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11076" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-1024x806.png 1024w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-300x236.png 300w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blogilates-beginners-calender-2-768x604.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>

<h3 id="day-1-total-body-workout">Day 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>Cassey starts off the video with some breathing techniques, for the absolute beginners to pilates (AKA me). She then goes into the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Pilates stance:</em> This is one of the easier ones although my neck kinda hurt a little.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Apparently one roll up is equivalent to six crunches and Cassey makes you do around four of these. I struggled with doing this properly as I really do not have the strength to lift myself up from a lying position without any support. I found this one kind of fun though.</li>
<li><em>Leg stuff:</em> Okay, this part was grueling! I have a tendency to painfully cramp in my legs, so I admit I did this section half-heartedly because it felt like I was constantly on the cusp of cramping up. Maybe that&rsquo;s just the nature of the workout but hopefully it improves soon. However, some of the moves are really graceful in this one and I really admired how pretty it looked (when Cassey did it).</li>
<li><em>Cobra position:</em> These moves were like something I&rsquo;d expect from yoga.</li>
<li><em>Elbow push ups:</em> I hate push ups with a dying passion but these were not that bad. Granted, I did do the knee variant. My knees also hurt afterward.</li>
<li><em>Mermaid stretches:</em> These are rather interesting. Although, I feel like I did them wrong because I didn&rsquo;t feel a lot of stretching going on.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Man, I&rsquo;m out of shape. I didn&rsquo;t do a lot of these exercises 100% as I&rsquo;m not used to physical activity like this. However, Cassey can be really encouraging and she does offer tips on how to ease up on the difficulty if you&rsquo;re having trouble.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some people complain about Cassey&rsquo;s perkiness but I have nothing to complain about, yet. Sometimes I felt like dying and Cassey would say something like, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t nothing yet!&rdquo; and I found it kind of motivating. But we&rsquo;ll see as time goes on. I did like how Cassey would tell stories, as it (kind of) takes your mind off the fact that you feel like you&rsquo;re dying.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel sore all over but I feel really happy to have day one over and done with! Starting is always the hardest part so just getting through the first little bit is always a struggle. I&rsquo;ve read that it only gets harder from here on in but I&rsquo;m hoping that I&rsquo;ll be able to stick through with it all.</p>

<p>I came to school on a reading day because I have a group project to work on. The meeting doesn’t start for another hour so I’m just going over my AI notes because I need to catch up on the material. Please excuse the mess. I work best with everything all over the place.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to document my life in a journal. There is something awfully romantic about keeping an account of your day to day life. I just read a book, <a href="http://books.erzadel.net/index.php?p=books.fairyland-a-memoir-of-my-father">Fairyland by Alysia Abbott</a>, about a woman who grew up with a single gay father in the &lsquo;80s. She reconstructed both her and her father&rsquo;s life through his journals and their letters to each other. I find it so beautiful.</p>

<p>Is it because I want to leave behind some sort of proof of my existence? Will I even have anyone to read my writings when I&rsquo;m gone? I don&rsquo;t even want to have kids eventually, at this point of my life. Maybe my life isn&rsquo;t even that interesting to keep up a diary. But I do love reading my old blog posts, no matter how cringe they are.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I&rsquo;d keep physical accounts of my life. I&rsquo;m still bitter over the fact that my mother takes it upon herself to read my journals now. I love the physical act of writing and the tangibility of writing makes is seem so much more precious. But then I found out my mother has been snooping. One day she mentioned a topic that I never told her about, but something that I had wrote. I was so extremely angry but I didn&rsquo;t say anything. It&rsquo;s not like I just leave my journals out in the open. I take lengths to hide them but my mother still manages to find them. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not as clever as I think I am.</p>

<p>I took up writing in <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/elianscript.htm">Elian script</a> to counteract this. However, decoding my entries took way too long. I recently found an easier script to read, <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/liron.php">Liron</a>. But I am so resentful (I looked up synonyms for bitter, haha) that I have to go through these measures.</p>

<p>I want to take up writing frequent blog posts, at the price of making these posts private. But what if my blog gets hacked? There&rsquo;s a little more risk involved than having my mother read my journals. I&rsquo;m really conflicted.</p>

<p>Team messy notes 2015. My mind was blown away during this lecture. Honestly, some of the algorithm solutions for simple problems like finding the two closest points in a plane, are extremely interesting. But it hurts my head knowing that I have to come up with solutions like these…</p>
