<h3 id="day-12-abs">Day 12: Abs</h3>

<p>Ab workouts are so brutal&hellip; And, of course, that&rsquo;s what everyone wants to workout. Cue the suffering.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-butt-workout">Video 1: Ab &amp; Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I seriously cannot get over how cute Rosanna is! She is absolutely adorable and when she struggles, I feel like I&rsquo;m not alone in ab hell. Somehow, she smiles through all of it! Workout goals&hellip;</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Scissors:</em> Literally the only easy workout in this video.</li>
<li><em>One Leg Crunch:</em> I still keep using my neck instead of my core to do these but it&rsquo;s so hard for me to lift up my shoulders still.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Thank goodness for roll ups (again).</li>
<li><em>Balancing Pilates Stances:</em> Thankfully, I made a better attempt at this one compared to last week.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> For the first time, I actually felt my butt working in this move&hellip; This was another move that was easier this time around!</li>
<li><em>Plank Twists:</em> Add this move to my &ldquo;Edel actually did it this time!&rdquo; list. I don&rsquo;t know what it was but they were easier this week. Although my feet kept pushing away the rug from my feet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-abs-on-fire">Video 2: Abs on Fire</h3>

<p>Cassey was not joking about the title when she named this video &ldquo;abs on fire.&rdquo; My abs&hellip; Were definitely on fire.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Genie Abs:</em> These&hellip; were surprisingly okay! I&rsquo;m really bad at using my core. It wasn&rsquo;t until Cassey made it harder did I start to struggle a little.</li>
<li><em>Eagle Abs:</em> This move is very&hellip; Twisty! I suck at any variation of crunches so this was not a fun move. I don&rsquo;t think I did it right at all. I ended up just holding onto my knees whenever I went up.</li>
<li><em>Runaway Abs:</em> What a cute move. It was hard though because it always hurts to try to lift my shoulders off the floor. I could feel my shoulder blades digging into the ground.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Stretch/Star Abs:</em> This was hard and I didn&rsquo;t have much room to do these properly. But I really tried to do these. Once again, once Cassey added a little more difficulty to the move, I tried it but just ended up doing the simple version again.</li>
<li><em>Clock Abs:</em> I do not like clock abs! I find it so hard to do and my hips go all over the place. But I tried my best, even if it was at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</li>
<li><em>Hollow Rock:</em> I could not do these very well! I kept sitting up all the way which is what is not what I was supposed to do, I&rsquo;m guessing.</li>
<li><em>Single Leg Drop:</em> You&rsquo;d think this move would be easy but I actually had some trouble with this one. But I pushed through it despite skipping some of the harder variations (completely by accident, I used my phone to watch this video and put it down without checking to see if anything changed).</li>
<li><em>Cheerleader L&rsquo;s:</em> There are two reasons why I was never a cheerleader. A) I have no flexibility or physical ability at all. B) We never had cheerleaders at my high school. So this move was really hard. I could barely do it. Actually, I couldn&rsquo;t do it! I just did it half-halfheartedly.</li>
<li><em>Earthquake:</em> Cassey said to expect shaking. Boy did the shaking happen. Every time Cassey said &ldquo;lower!&rdquo; I laughed and held my position. I did try to go as low as I could but it was not low enough at all.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-relax-with-me-stretch">Video 3: Relax with Me Stretch</h3>

<p>I was a little wary doing the stretches because on Friday I was stretching and gave myself a charley horse. The beach scenery was a nice touch. Typical California. I want sun too&hellip;</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Rise and Shine:</em> A move with almost no effort. Just a nice start to the stretching. I felt like a weird flower or something.</li>
<li><em>Side Bend Stretch:</em> Another easy move. My left side was feeling a little sore so I tried my best not to overdo it.</li>
<li><em>Half Rainbow Glute:</em> My left side was definitely not stretched out enough due to my soreness but my right side was feeling nice and taut!</li>
<li><em>Stretching Child/Mini Child Press:</em> Ramping up the difficulty just a tad bit. Presses are hard for me no matter what. But it was still relatively easy.</li>
<li><em>Down Dog:</em> This move actually made me sweaty. How do stretches make me more sweaty than the actual workout itself??</li>
<li><em>Dogging Cobra:</em> This move made me even more sweatier. I got pretty tired by the end and really had to push through it.</li>
<li><em>Head Rolls:</em> Is it a little weird how I&rsquo;m paranoid about cracking my neck? Usually it feels good but I&rsquo;m guessing I had no knots to straighten out today.</li>
<li><em>Soul Stretch:</em> This is definitely a move that makes you sigh with relief. I love the stretch in this one!</li>
<li><em>Long Lunge Twist:</em> My balance was tested in this move. I have no balance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>It was pretty disheartening to read the comments on the Blogilates page about people feeling discourage by today&rsquo;s videos. The &ldquo;Abs on Fire&rdquo; video was definitely hard and a little outside of my difficulty range. I stumbled through that video and didn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;complete&rdquo; it at all. But I know that I suck at the moment and I&rsquo;m not strong enough and I accepted it. Maybe this the only advantage of being self deprecating all the time? So if you&rsquo;re feeling demotivated by the &ldquo;Abs on Fire&rdquo; video, it&rsquo;s okay. As long as you even attempt some of the moves, you are making progress. You&rsquo;re not there YET but if you keep pushing through, you will be there eventually!</p>

<h3 id="day-11-lower-body">Day 11: Lower Body</h3>

<p>Another day, another week almost finished (I&rsquo;m talking in terms of the weekday week and not the Blogilates week)! I keep mixing up the &ldquo;Wake up and &hellip;&rdquo; preambles at the start of each day&hellip;. Yesterday I did 30 second planks on each side instead of just 1 minute of planking. I really hate those planks&hellip; You will not hear me say that enough, haha!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-pick-me-up-quickie-workout">Video 1: Pick Me Up Quickie Workout</h3>

<p>Cassey is totally peppy and first thing in the morning, I&rsquo;m not quite sure if I&rsquo;m feeling the happiness. But this is a new workout video so I tried to give it a shot.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Dogging Cobra:</em> This move is fun to do! I didn&rsquo;t find it too hard but like with any move, with more repetitions, it got more tiring to do. Cassey said it really wakes you up, especially early in the morning and she is right, haha.</li>
<li><em>Clam Kicks:</em> I find this move really interesting. My bones kept cracking with this one, on both legs. This doesn&rsquo;t get as tiring as other moves in this video.</li>
<li><em>Single Arm Press:</em> I found this move really hard! My hip (?) bone kept pressing down into the floor and it hurt. I even pulled out a rug to put under me to make it hurt less, haha!</li>
<li><em>Boat Teaser:</em> I could not do this move at the pace Cassey did it. I don&rsquo;t have a strong enough core to lift myself up. I probably approached it wrong because I did it like a roll up and then attempted to bring my legs in. Whoops.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-body-slimming-workout">Video 2: Body Slimming Workout</h3>

<p>Since I already listed the moves in this workout previously, I&rsquo;m not going to attempt to list them out again. I did much better this time around. Those hundreds still kill me. I really need to work on my Pilates stance. Fortunately, I was actually able to do the parachuters move this time around! I love these confidence boosting videos, haha.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-6-minutes-to-sexy-thighs">Video 3: 6 Minutes to Sexy Thighs</h3>

<p>Not really liking the title of this video because it makes me feel a little vain or shallow, haha.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Criss Cross Scissors:</em> I think this is the easiest move in this video. It was kind of fun as well. I closed my eyes for a bit, like Cassey suggested. It was kind of humorous listening to Cassey, a California girl, talk about the cold. Try living where there&rsquo;s snow!</li>
<li><em>Froggers:</em> This one is also kind of easy compared to the other ones in this workout. It&rsquo;s more tiring than the criss cross scissors but not as tiring as some of the other moves in today&rsquo;s videos.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift Presses:</em> This one was a struggle. I have trouble with the double leg lift to begin with and adding those presses made it even more difficult.</li>
<li><em>Leg Side Press:</em> I&rsquo;m tempted to say these were the hardest moves in this video. Staying up and resisting the urge to sink to the floor was hard. The actual move was SO tiring. It was a relief when Cassey spent less time on the last side, haha.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve done a workout <em>first thing</em> in the morning. Okay, I admit, I kind of browsed on my phone for a quick few minutes and then I worked out but it&rsquo;s close enough for me! The first video was a little hard, the second video was a good motivation booster, and the last workout was definitely a challenge. I also actually got sweaty today doing these. Surprisingly enough, it was during the video that was the easiest for me, the body slimming workout!</p>

<h3 id="day-10-abs">Day 10: Abs</h3>

<p>The day starts off with two thirty second planks on each side. How I hate planks&hellip; But I did it anyway, even if I cheated for a couple seconds on each. There&rsquo;s only one new video today and I decided that I wouldn&rsquo;t list all the moves for the other videos again in the interest of time and because I don&rsquo;t really have anything to say about specific moves.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-time">Video 1: Ab Time</h3>

<p>This video is so simple and without graphics, it&rsquo;s so weird now that I&rsquo;m used to her more recent videos! The moves are considerably easier this time around. I was able to do the plank and plank variations which made me pretty happy!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-bubble-butt-workout">Video 2: Bubble Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little skeptical on the whole butt thing (is lifting my butt a good thing even if I have absolutely no butt?) but I did this workout anyway. I was able to go through this entire video without cheating. The grasshopper move at the end is still pretty hard for me. I&rsquo;m getting bonier and my hips hurt being pushed to the ground&hellip; Otherwise, I think my butt is on it&rsquo;s way to become a butt!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-best-stretches-for-chilling-out">Video 3: Best Stretches for Chilling Out</h3>

<p>These stretches feel so good afterwards! Early in the day I got a Charliehorse in one leg and almost in the other so I didn&rsquo;t push myself as much as I could have. I just hate cramping up. Obviously I need to do more stretches and drink more water.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Today was an overall good day! In the morning I went to my spin class. We had a different instructor today and he worked us HARD. But the things he did were so fun and really did include some familiar pilates moves. A lot of working out in my core. However, the post stretch workout gave me a Charlie horse in my right leg and it was pretty sore until the evening. I also spent a good amount of the day walking around as I walked to the clinic to see a doctor (nothing serious, don&rsquo;t worry).</p>

<p>The Blogilates workouts today was definitely a feel good motivator. It&rsquo;s great seeing some sort of progress. Maybe that means tomorrow will be especially hard! I&rsquo;m expecting to receive the March calendar soon so maybe I&rsquo;ll do them in parallel and see if that ramps up the difficulty. It makes me a little nervous knowing how the workouts can get harder. Some of the days seem so hard already! Well, I guess I just gotta push through.</p>

<h3 id="day-9-abs">Day 9: Abs</h3>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to list the moves for this video again because my comments are mostly the same from the last time I did this video. I really am progressing with those pull ups. Not once did I have to grab my legs! However I do rely on my momentum more rather than my core, but still. This might be old news but I still hate the hundred move&hellip; It totally hurts my neck and I know I&rsquo;m doing it wrong but I just can&rsquo;t do it right, yet.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-abc-abs">Video 2: ABC Abs</h3>

<p>I won&rsquo;t list the moves to this video either because there are only two moves. The first one is a position where you have to draw letters in your air using your arms. It&rsquo;s hard because it&rsquo;s in a Pilates stance. I had to pause a couple of times to regain my composure. The second move is the same thing but with the legs and different positioning. My tailbone really bothers me a lot when it comes to these exercise. So I struggled doing this one as well, but not as much as I did with the first one.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>My overall thoughts for today? I hate ABC Abs, haha! I think they are the hardest moves so far in this calendar. It now feels like I&rsquo;ve been doing it forever but it&rsquo;s only day nine! Time flies&hellip; Can I just fast forward to the end where I&rsquo;m string and fit and can eat cheat food!</p>

<h3 id="day-8-total-body">Day 8: Total Body</h3>

<p>After my &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been missing Cassey a little. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s already the second week! It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s been that long&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="video-1-indoor-cardio-workout">Video 1: Indoor Cardio Workout</h3>

<p>I wish I had more time to do workouts in the morning because when it comes to the cardio videos, I just can&rsquo;t do them 100% without making a bunch of noise. I workout at night which is the most convenient time for me. I did get my heart rate up though, even if I didn&rsquo;t do the workout to my fullest.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-body-slimming-workout">Video 2: Body Slimming Workout</h3>

<p>This &ldquo;body slimming&rdquo; workout is essentially a rehash of the beginner&rsquo;s pilate video Cassey made. I enjoy the better quality a lot!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll Ups:</em> I&rsquo;m slowly working my way up from an assisted to non-assisted roll up! I can do a couple of roll ups now without holding onto my legs, however my feet kind of lift off the ground but it&rsquo;s progress!</li>
<li><em>Pilates Stance:</em> This move is okay, I&rsquo;m finding it easier to hold myself up but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m holding myself up high enough.</li>
<li><em>The Hundred:</em> These still are pretty hard for me but when Cassey turned from table top to straight let, I was surprised at how it didn&rsquo;t get much harder. I can feel myself do these better and without as much strain in my neck!</li>
<li><em>Bridge Pulses:</em> This is a new move! At first it felt really easy to do but then I started to really feel it in my butt. Now, whenever Cassey says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll feel it in your butt,&rdquo; I never do so this is a first for me.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> I still don&rsquo;t know how to position my hands so that my tailbone doesn&rsquo;t hurt&hellip;</li>
<li><em>Half Cobra Pushup:</em> The cobra moves are a little bit more easier to do every time.</li>
<li><em>Parachuter:</em> Another new move! This move is cool but I have no idea if I&rsquo;m doing it right. I feels like I&rsquo;m lifting my body up but again, is it high enough? I don&rsquo;t know.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-stretches-to-relieve-lower-back-pain">Video 3: Stretches to Relieve Lower Back Pain</h3>

<p>I tend to slouch a lot but lately I&rsquo;m becoming more conscious of my posture. My back surprisingly hurts more than usual so I was hoping these would help me in some way.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Seated Twist:</em> These felt really good! I do a variation of this whenever I&rsquo;m sitting down.</li>
<li><em>Pretzel:</em> Cassey claims that this move was a typical gym class move but I&rsquo;m not sure I remember it! I didn&rsquo;t feel this one as much but it was surprising to me to find out that I&rsquo;m more flexible on my right compared to my left side.</li>
<li><em>Cobra:</em> I just can&rsquo;t seem to escape the cobras&hellip; Maybe that&rsquo;s a good thing because it&rsquo;s the thing that I need to work on the most!</li>
<li><em>Scorpion Twist:</em> Hmmm, I don&rsquo;t really see the correlation with a scorpion but this was a fun move regardless. I didn&rsquo;t have much room to do these but it was still a good stretch.</li>
<li><em>Cat-Dog:</em> This reminds me of like otso-otso in slow motion. Below my shoulders it kind of started to hurt. I didn&rsquo;t feel much of a stretch but I really tried to mimic the ost-otso flow, haha!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>First day of week 2 is over! Today was a little slow with the recap and just a couple of new moves. The cardio wasn&rsquo;t as heart pumping as I wanted it to be, solely my fault. I&rsquo;m a little skeptical of the stretches videos because they seem so &ldquo;complimentary&rdquo; to the cardio and workout video but it&rsquo;s a good way to wind down!</p>
