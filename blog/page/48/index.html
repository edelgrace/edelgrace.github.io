            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Okay, for two weeks I told myself that I would watch the Worlds for figure skating but now I have some time to watch some of it. In typical &ldquo;me-fashion&rdquo; these posts are purely for my own enjoyment (that is the philosophy of this blog anyway sp yes, I am extremely vain!). <strong>I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT FIGURE SKATING.</strong> I just enjoy watching it. Read on if you dare!</p>

<p><strong>Opening ceremony</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I love the little figure skating girls! And I&rsquo;m so sorry, but as they were doing the flag bit, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think &ldquo;that is how you use props, Adelina.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m so sorry&hellip; I like her but that just sprung into my mind&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Pairs Short Program</strong></p>

<p>Wow, I picked a stream with absolutely no commentary. This is a little bit discomforting. Weird. Now I don&rsquo;t know if something was truly &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;good&rdquo; in terms of how stuff should actually be done. Also, wow I can see their current score? This actually makes me so anxious.</p>

<p>But seriously, watching that score makes me nervous wow.</p>

<p><strong>Austria (Miriam Ziegler and Severin Kiefer)</strong></p>

<p>A bit slow at the end. They looked so disappointed when they were done though. Aweh, don&rsquo;t frown, I enjoyed it!!</p>

<p><strong>Great Britain (Amani Fancy and Christopher Boyadji)</strong></p>

<p>I wish my last name was Fancy. Also, Fancy is 16 years old?? Whaaat?? Awehh Fancy, it&rsquo;s okay that you missed that landing. Aweh, oh no I feel so bad! They way Fancy twirled down after that lift though, wow. That was beautiful. Happy birthday to that girl they mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine (Julia Lavrentieva and Yuri Rudyk)</strong></p>

<p>Aweh, it looked like Lavrentieva made a two foot landing. Still looked impressive though. I hate it when skaters make mistakes early in their program because I don&rsquo;t want them to worry too much and let it affect the rest of it. Kudos to the skaters who can overcome but it makes me worried too! Not sure if I&rsquo;m digging their music a whole lot.</p>

<p>Is it just me or did the three first pairs have the same coach or something?? The dude(s?) who greeted all three of them look the same. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not paying enough attention, lol.</p>

<p>Also, is this The Fray playing in the background? Lol what.</p>

<p>Omg no, I know this is the kiss and cry but nooo, please don&rsquo;t cry!</p>

<p>Ahhh it&rsquo;s the warm up and the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the US pair just fell. Nooo don&rsquo;t let it affect you, Zhang, noooo.</p>

<p>Aaaand now they&rsquo;re playing Marianas Trench. Who picked this playlist?? Japan, please.</p>

<p><strong>Germany (Maylin Wende and Daniel Wende)</strong></p>

<p>Aweeh are they married?? Or siblings??<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-737" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-737">1</a></sup> Digging their song choice. Holy shoes, that lift was beautiful. And Maylin almost fell on that toss (throw?? I wonder what the real term is), but she saved it. You go girl! Spins are usually my favourite part about figure skating and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get used to how slow pairs are at those spins. And ommmg he kissed her when they finished. Awehhh. Now that is a ship I won&rsquo;t feel guilty for shipping. Ommmg in the K and C, Maylin just made the cutest gesture.</p>

<p><strong>USA (Felicia Zhang and Nathan Bartholomay)</strong></p>

<p>Omg I&rsquo;m so digging their song choice. Loving their speed. That toss flip thing was pretty fast as well. Gosh, that must take a whole lot of trust. And yeeah Zhang landed that jump. And the second one too. Also, I heard someone yell &ldquo;YEAH!!!&rdquo; in the stands, LOL. Omg, she&rsquo;s soo cute.</p>

<p>Seriously, what is with this playlist playing in between each skate??</p>

<p>Wait, did they just lower their score from 35 to 33? Ouch.</p>

<p>Also, the dude that greeted them. Totally hot. Just saying.</p>

<p><strong>Italy (Nicole Della Monica and Matteo Guarise)</strong></p>

<p>The Japanese announcer said &ldquo;Italy&rdquo; in Japanese and I was so confused like &ldquo;what does Hetalia (the anime) have to do with figure skating?&rdquo; but then I remembered Hetalia is Italy in Japanese. I am seriously so ashamed right now. Loving their musicality so far. Ouch, that landing on the toss wasn&rsquo;t A+. Oh no, a touch down on that jump. That costume on Guarise is not flattering at all. Costume designers, what are you doing??</p>

<p><strong>Russia (Julia Antipova and Nodari Maisuradze)</strong></p>

<p>Gooooo Russia. Antipova looks so darling and cute!! I love her costume too. She looks so tiny compared to Maisuradze! Omg. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about how tiny she is. I mean, she is 16 but Fancy is 16 too but Fancy isn&rsquo;t as tiny as her. How werid is it for these 20-something guys to dance with 16 year old girls? Omg her Russian is great though.</p>

<p>Okay, I approve of them playing Panic! at the Disco. All the other music choices are iffy.</p>

<p><strong>Japan (Narumi Takahashi and Ryuichi Kihara)</strong></p>

<p>Oh no, they&rsquo;re both soooo cute. Also, what?? Takahashi is 22 and Kihara 21?? Noooo way. She looks so young! They both look so young! Not a fan of Kihara&rsquo;s outfit. Once again, costume designers, please. Ouch, only a 2.80 so far? Wait, it bumped up to 6.00. Still. Ouch. I&rsquo;m loving their step-ish sequence part (I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called, I don&rsquo;t know what most things are called, I&rsquo;m so sorry). Also, yesss. Loving their speed on their spins. Omg Ryuichi is sooo cute.</p>

<p><strong>Belruse (Maria Paliakova and Nikita Bochkov)</strong></p>

<p>Holy buff. Bochkov looks so buff and muscular. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because male figure skaters just look too skinny. Loving Paliakova&rsquo;s costume. Bochkov&rsquo;s? Not so much. These poor men. Omg they&rsquo;re both really cute, too. Omggg. What a beautiful language they&rsquo;re speaking! Bochkov is too adorable in the Kiss and Cry.</p>

<p><strong>Estonia (Natalja Zabijako and Alexandr Zaboev)</strong></p>

<p>Zaboev&rsquo;s hair is to die for. Why is it that these girls who are over 20 totally do not look like they&rsquo;re over 20?? Loving Zabijako&rsquo;s costume though. Also, wow, that spin toss thing. Wow. Pretty. The music choice is so fun. And ahhh they looked so synchronized in their jump. Wow, I&rsquo;m so loving this program so far. Sad their technical score isn&rsquo;t 100% great. Aweh. I&rsquo;m hoping for a 50 from this pair. Aweh, 46.11 is still good!</p>

<p><strong>Bulgaria (Elizaveta Makarova and Leri Kenchadze)</strong></p>

<p>Wow, Kenchadze is smoking. Loving the song choice. So spicy. So high energy.</p>

<p>Aaaand my stream stopped working<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-737" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-737">2</a></sup>. I guess that means I should start working on my homework. Ugh, waiting for Hanyu is sheer tortue.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Since I gave up Tumblr for Lent, I realized how much free time I had on my hands without Tumblr. I decided, why not get back into TCGs? And so I did.</p>

<p>TCG stands for &ldquo;Trading Card Game.&rdquo; There are TCGs around the Internet that you can join as long as you yourself have a bit of space on the Internet. The goal of the game is basically to collect all the cards that are available in the game. They aren&rsquo;t like the strategy TCGs where players duel against each other (in other words, it&rsquo;s <strong>not like</strong> Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh!). However, you can trade cards with other players. To get cards, you have to play games like hangman, tic-tac-toe, etc. Some TCGs get really creative with the games but not all TCGs do.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the appeal of TCGs are. I don&rsquo;t even know how I got into TCGs in the first place!</p>

<p>The very first TCG I joined was called <em>Very Beauty</em>. The link is dead now and has been dead for quite a while. The site went on hiatus around the summer of 2012. It focused on Japanese music and entertainment. I mostly joined it for the music aspect. The cards I collected mostly were of rockers, haha. DIR EN GREY and L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel, were of course, my main priorities! Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t manage to master any decks while I was a part of that TCG.</p>

<p>Looking back on it now, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the card templates. It was so confusing as there were two different sizes for the cards. It made it easier to distinguish the different card types but at the same time, it looked like clutter! Below are some of the cards, that I managed to snag before the site closed down. The first one is of hide from X JAPAN, the second is of the music video LEECH by The Gazette, and lastly, is the beautiful Acchan from Perfume!</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>However, my favourite TCG is <a href="http://rapture.lightning-blade.net/">Rapture</a>. This TCG is themed around boy pairings in animanga and video games. I&rsquo;m actually not a huge fan of boy pairings, to be honest. It&rsquo;s weird, I know! The only two boy pairings that I ship are Oreki and Fukube from <em>Hyouka</em> and Kaworu and Shinji from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. But I joined this TCG anwyay. I just love the card templates! Rapture is definitely one of the prettiest TCGs out there right now.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m actually pretty decent with this TCG! I&rsquo;ve already mastered a couple of decks already. In fact, I think this is the only TCG where I have actually mastered any decks. Currently though, I&rsquo;m working to master the Kaworu x Shinji deck. I just recently finished Evangelion, so that&rsquo;s a fairly recent ship of mine.</p>

<p>But like, look at these cards&hellip; So pretty! Featuring Xanxus x Superbia Squalo from <em>Katekyo Hitman REBORN!</em>, Kaworu x Shinji from <em>NGE</em>, and Houtarou x Satoshi from <em>Hyouka</em>.</p>

</p>

<p>However, right now I&rsquo;m waiting on a Japanese music TCG. There&rsquo;s a couple that are inactive, which makes me sad! There are A LOT of Korean pop music TCGs floating around. I joined one of them. I don&rsquo;t even listen to that much K-Pop. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m mostly just collecting 2NE1, BIG BANG, AOA, Younha, and BoA decks right now. I also collect decks that have cute short haired girls in them. K-Pop girls are really cute, okay?</p>

        <p>Man, this was the most productive week I&rsquo;ve had since Reading Week! I&rsquo;m super happy with my level of productivity. I got a lot done and I still managed to have a large amount of free time all to myself. On Tuesday, I got to hang out with a friend for two hours and I still got stuff done.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I went on a <strong>Kill la Kill</strong> marathon. My friends have been bugging me about watching it and since the finale was Thursday night, I spent the entire day catching up on the series. I had to watch about 14 episodes. As soon as I got home, I definitely just sat there and watched until around 11 at night. And it was okay, because in the morning, I was done everything I needed to do! I will say though, that the finale was pretty good. I was a bit disappointed because Kill la Kill was so hyped up but it wasn&rsquo;t as good as I thought it would be. My expectations for anime are too high. I just want another <strong>Evangelion</strong>! Needless to say, I&rsquo;m looking forward to 3.33 in 2015. Please hurry up!</p>

        <p>Man, lately I&rsquo;ve just been scouring the Internet (okay, YouTube) for new music. I&rsquo;m so hungry for new music! Anyway, here are my findings.</p>

<p><strong>Buhar Jerreau</strong><br />
These guys are at the top of my list at the moment. They&rsquo;re a hip-hop/rap group of three guys from Kazakhstan. According to translations of their lyrics, I find them to be extremely talented at song writing. I really am in love with the beats of their songs (I don&rsquo;t know rap lingo&hellip;). They all just make me bob my head. <del>It helps that all of them are really attractive too.</del> From what I could find, they have a dozen or so songs released but not much.<br />
<strong>Favourite song(s):</strong> Мост<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-702">1</a></sup>, Текстиль<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-702">2</a></sup>, 498<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-702">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Yeng Constantino</strong><br />
She&rsquo;s definitely not new to me but my love her has rekindled in the form of this duet cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcXdxynVn80">Kahit Maputi Na Ang Buhok Ko</a> (Even Though My Hair is White). I really love Yeng&rsquo;s voic. So soft and pure. I suspect some autotune in this track though, but that&rsquo;s not to say <em>all</em> autotune is bad. We already know Yeng has a great voice, so it&rsquo;s no insult to her. But yes. Her voice in this song makes me melt. She recently got engaged (not to the dude in the video) so I feel like her feelings in singing this song was genuine.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Panginoon (Lord)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-702">4</a></sup>, Josephine<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_5-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_5-702">5</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>在日ファンク (Zainichi Funk/Japan Funk)</strong><br />
I have absolutely no idea how I stumbled across this band. Their a jazz/funk band from Japan. They get accussed of (I say accussed because it almost always has a negative connotation to it) of being a James Brown rip off. I personally have no problem with this because they are amazing. The live band with instruments are so top. The vocalist has a distinct voice and yeah, it&rsquo;s totally James Brown at times. If you watch performances, you can see the vocalist has moves. Man. Dude can dance!<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> 嘘 (Uso/Lie)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_6-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_6-702">6</a></sup>, 爆弾こわい (Bakudan Kowai/Scary Bomb) <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_7-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_7-702">7</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Predawn</strong><br />
Another musician from Japan. Apparently her name is Miwako Shimizu. She has a very soft crooning sort of voice that hipsters would absolutely love. I&rsquo;m no hipster but I&rsquo;m still super in love with her! She sings almost entirely in English, I think. Her voice is so soft that sometimes it can be hard to understand her but her accent sounds like it&rsquo;s English (as in London, England). It seems so fluent! And her lyrics are top notch too. Pretty much almost at Joanna Newsom&rsquo;s level of song writing.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Keep Silence<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_8-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_8-702">8</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Astrud Gilberto</strong><br />
A Brazilian bossa nova from the 60s. I absolutely love her voice. Like I said, I&rsquo;m not a musician but her voice at time sounds a bit monotone or flat but it still manages to bring a sense of personality into her music and creates a unique atmosphere. I love her voice and the songs she performs! She also has a cute accent. She was also pretty cute back in the day.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> How Insensitive<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_9-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_9-702">9</a></sup>, Fly Me to the Moon<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_10-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_10-702">10</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Hitomit Takahashi</strong><br />
Ugh, I forgot she existed! She did some theme songs for a couple of animes (Bokutachi wa no Yukue for Gundam SEED Destiny is the one that introduced me to her) but after I finished the anime, I barely touched any of her other songs. I was feeling nostalgic and decided to check out if she had new songs. She did! I barely recognized her, voice and face wise. She changed so much! Was Gundam SEED Destiny that old? Answer is kinda (10 years ago, wow).<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Wo Ai Ni<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_11-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_11-702">11</a></sup>, MUSIC<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_12-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_12-702">12</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>MEG</strong><br />
Last and certainly not least, is MEG. I love MEG. I&rsquo;m utterly in love with MEG. She&rsquo;s beautiful. She doesn&rsquo;t have a strong voice and usually relies on heavily mixed and autotuned songs but they&rsquo;re still catchy and great. There is something about her that captivates me. She knows she&rsquo;s cute and sexy and she owns it and she sells it. She&rsquo;s also a fashion designer and wow, her clothes are A+, I think (I don&rsquo;t know about fashiion, haha).<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> TRAP<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_13-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_13-702">13</a></sup>,WEAR I AM <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_14-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_14-702">14</a></sup></p>

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_1-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZK_8jh4ySo">x</a>] The music video is really well done. This is a song with a REALLY catchy beat. The chorus is really simplistic but it just hooks you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_1-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_2-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZjyRKFqi5s">x</a>] The comments on the video is all about T.O.P, lol. The main dude, I don&rsquo;t know their names yet, has a voice a lot like T.O.P&rsquo;s in this song. Another song with a catchy beat. I love the industrial booming sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_2-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_3-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeA22r9YnRQ">x</a>] This has like a mishmash of styles. It has a slight &ldquo;I Got a Boy&rdquo; feeling to it in terms of the mishmashing. I admit, my favourite part is at the end when the song is consumed by the melody. Gives me chills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_3-702"></a>

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_5-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN_YQowvbUc">x</a>] Very innovative in terms of OPM music. None of the recycled ballad shtick. Very calm and relaxing as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_5-702"></a>

  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_6-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq1nNykPCDQ">x</a>] Very calm and smooth. The vocalist may be trying too hard to be soft, his voice wavers a lot or is that intentional vibrato? I will never know because I&rsquo;m not a musician. Still love the song though.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_6-702"></a>

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_7-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H14XFS1zVo">x</a>] This song is so high energy! I love it! It&rsquo;s also super catchy. I want to dance around and sing along.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_7-702"></a>

  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_9-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x2i2GITQ0Y">x</a>] The song that started it all.

  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_10-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqjiEOLHhas">x</a>] I love Frank Sinatra but I love pretty much every version of Fly Me to the Moon except for his original version.

  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_11-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10kPphUY8hA">x</a>] Technically Hitomi features in this song but omg. Might as well give her the song if she sings 90% of it, right? That said, I love BEAT CRUSADERS as well. This song is so cute and energetic.

  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_12-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBy2QcFLLzA">x</a>] Very simple song but very catchy. Not used to Hitomi with long hair.

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_13-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BymanWZK1GA">x</a>] Omg. Omg??? OMG??? This song is really chic, sexy, and sophisticated. Has a lot of &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; influence and wow, the clothes. MEG really sells this song. Every time I listen to it or watched the video, my heart races and I&rsquo;m always singing along. I fell for your trap, are you happy now MEG?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_13-702"></a>

        <p>Wow I am so not proud of myself at all lately. Ugh. School. Please be done and over with!</p>

<p>The pictures aren&rsquo;t great because I didn&rsquo;t take them in &ldquo;natural light&rdquo; like I usually do and it&rsquo;s currently 11:07 PM. Still Sunday, so I&rsquo;m technically not late!</p>
