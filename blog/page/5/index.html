            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Seeing that I am now unemployed and have a lot of time on my hands, I decided to utilize the free month of <a href="https://udacity.com">Udacity</a> I received from Github&rsquo;s <a href="http://education.github.com/pack">Student Pack</a>.</p>

<p>This mini-project&rsquo;s goal is to create a simple program using Python to open a web browser at an interval of ten seconds three times in a row.</p>

<p>Here is my answer:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import time
import webbrowser

break_duration = 10
break_num = 3
break_count = 0

print("This program started at: " + time.ctime())

while(break_count < break_num):

    time.sleep(break_duration)

    webbrowser.open("http://edelgrace.me/blog")

    break_count += 1</code></pre>

<p>First I will explain the first two lines. In Python, there are many different modules that you can utilize to achieve specific things. Think of them as apps that you use on your phone. You have apps for calendars, contacts, games, social media, etc. Just like apps, we don&rsquo;t really need to know how exactly modules works, just how to use them to get what we want. In this case, we use modules to get information about the time and to use the web browser on the computer.</p>

<pre><code class="python">import time
import webbrowser</code></pre>

<p>Next, I initialize some variables. Think of this as giving something a name. For example, I am 22 years old as of writing this. This would be my age. In the code, I am declaring that the <code>break_duration</code> (how long to wait to open a web browser) is 10 seconds. The <code>break_num</code> determines how many breaks to take, which is 3. Lastly, the number of breaks taken so far, <code>break_count</code>, is 0.</p>

<pre><code class="python">break_duration = 10
break_num = 3
break_count = 0</code></pre>

<p>This line will print out a message to the console with the <code>print</code> function. Inside print, it uses a function from the <code>time</code> module that we imported earlier. The function we use is <code>ctime()</code>, which grabs the value of the current time.</p>

<pre><code class="python">print("This program started at: " + time.ctime())></code></pre>

<p>The last chunk of code is a <code>while</code> loop. Think of while loops as a set of instructions to repeat until a condition is met. I will break this down line by line.</p>

<pre><code class="python">while(break_count < break_num):

    time.sleep(break_duration)

    webbrowser.open("http://edelgrace.me/blog")

    break_count += 1</code></pre>

<p>The first line determines the condition. This loop will keep running as long as the number of breaks taken (<code>break_count</code>) is less than the number of breaks that should be taken (<code>break_num</code>, which is 3). When this condition is not met, the code inside the while loop will stop running.</p>

<pre><code class="python">while(break_count < break_num):</code></pre>

<p>Then we use the function <code>time.sleep()</code> to essentially wait for the number of seconds and essentially do nothing. From the official Python documentation, we can see that this function will accept numbers in terms of seconds, which is what we are using in <code>break_duration</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="python">time.sleep(break_duration)</code></pre>

<p>Once the 10 seconds has elapsed, the next line of code will run. This uses the <code>webbrowser.open()</code> function. It essentially does what it says: open a web browser. Here, we indicate which site to open. In my case, we open up my blog for a quick break. :)</p>

<pre><code class="python">webbrowser.open("http://edelgrace.me/blog")</code></pre>

<p>After that is all done, we have finished a break. Therefore, we increase the variable <code>break_num</code> by one to indicate that a break has been finished.</p>

<pre><code class="python">break_count += 1</code></pre>

<p>The code then goes back to the start of the while loop and checks the condition. <code>break_count</code> is now 0+1=1 which is still less than <code>break_num</code> (which is 3). This repeats two more times until <code>break_count</code> is 3 and then the condition fails and the while loop is skipped over. Since there is no more code after the while loop, the program ends.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of July, I&rsquo;ve been recording the highs and lows of the daily temperature through granny squares. The middle colour represents the low of the day and the outer colour represents the high of the day. The first three days of July were roughly the same but the fourth was a little bit cooler.</p>

<p>They say that Alberta is going to have a heat wave the next couple of days but I don&rsquo;t feel it yet. I went to the gym this morning and there was a nice cool breeze. I&rsquo;m sitting in my room right now and I&rsquo;m not sweating one bit (TMI, I sweat pretty easily). I wish it would stay like this until the end of summer but I truly do anticipate the weather kicking up a notch.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently trying to think about when I should start joining the squares. I&rsquo;m thinking maybe every weekend is when I&rsquo;ll take the time to do it. Looking at weaving all those ends makes me a little bit nervous too. Ah, oh well. I find that once I start weaving in ends, it&rsquo;s not so bad. Just getting started on weaving ends is where my mind goes, &ldquo;Maybe later&#8230;&ldquo;</p>

        <p>I am just starting to get into knitting as well and I decided to buy a relatively cheap set of bamboo knitting needles. I found this <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00QGI9ZPG">LIHAO Bamboo set on Amazon</a> for around $16.99 CAD. Included are 18 pairs of needles ranging from 2.0mm to 10.0mm. It also came with a knitting gauge which is super helpful!</p>

<p>From a quick look over, there are no obvious defects. The reviews say that they are perfect for beginners so we&rsquo;ll see! I&rsquo;m a bit worried in that most of the patterns I&rsquo;m seeing that are interesting call for circular needles but maybe I&rsquo;ll slowly work myself up to that first.</p>

<p>I also bought these Takumi Bamboo Needles. They&rsquo;re 5.0mm and around 10&#8243; long. They are very light and I did try doing a basic knit and purl stitch with them. Let me tell you, going from 12.0mm to 5.0mm needles is a big difference as a beginner!</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> There is spoilers for the entire anime and (presumably) manga. Mentions of mature themes such as sexual content is also included.</p>

<p>Now that classes have ended and I&rsquo;m unemployed, I am taking it a little bit slow with my free time. I recently started on working a new afghan square for the month of July and watching various movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime. I stumbled across <em>Kuzu no Honkai</em> and while the synopsis made me skeptical, I decided to give it a shot.</p>

<p><em>Kuzu no Honkai</em> is about two high schoolers. Mugi and Hanabi, who are in love with their teachers. It&rsquo;s obvious they have zero chance with their love interests because they are interested in each other. Instead, they use each other to fill the void that their teachers wouldn&rsquo;t be able to provide for them.</p>

<p>This made me think that it would be your stereotypical student-teacher love square anime. Somehow, the first episode hooked me in. I was caught off guard by how explicit Mugi and Hanabi&rsquo;s relationship is portrayed. One of their first scenes together is them making out passionately at the side of their school after witnessing their teachers flirting with each other.</p>

<p>The first thing that came to my mind was the similarity with the movie, <em>In the Mood for Love</em>, where the main characters, Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow, pretend to be each other&rsquo;s spouses because their spouses are cheating on them with each other. However, the similarities end there. Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow initially partake in this role play because they want to understand how an affair between their spouses could have possibly happened. Mugi and Hanabi just want to live in a little fantasy where their feelings are reciprocated by their love interests.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear to the both of them that they are using each other for their own selfish desires, giving each other what their teachers couldn&rsquo;t. In fact, it&rsquo;s mutually agreed upon. However, they aren&rsquo;t the only ones who are using others for their own benefit.</p>

<p>Mugi&rsquo;s object of affection, Akane, also uses others. Her identity is based upon being promiscuous and living off the desire of men and envy of women. Each fling she has makes her feel alive but they never really make an impact on her where it matters most. She uses these men to simply fulfill her own sense of worth and cement her role that she had made for herself. In the end, these men fill up a void in her but never to the brim.</p>

<p>Akane even goes to the length of playing with Hanabi&rsquo;s emotions through seducing Kanai, Hanabi&rsquo;s love interest. It&rsquo;s even revealed that Akane had been calculating towards this since the first episode.</p>

<p>Mugi isn&rsquo;t faultless either for he spends a day in a hotel with the woman he lost his virginity to. Since Hanabi is a virgin, he was not comfortable going any further with her. However, he was still craving that lust he has from their interactions and as a result, he turns to another woman. After that, he even accepts a date with a childhood friend that is desperately in love with him but who he doesn&rsquo;t care for on the same level.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Hanabi also strays from her relationship with Mugi when he starts being distant and denies consummating their relationship. She turns to her friend Ecchan and although Hanabi is mostly straight, she gives into her desires and sleeps with Ecchan. Her reasoning is that since her relationship with Mugi had no real meaning, that this too would have no meaning either. Although Hanabi doesn&rsquo;t see her love interest in Ecchan, she still uses Ecchan when she is craving the physical intimacy that Mugi doesn&rsquo;t give her.</p>

<p>The feeling is reciprocal between Hanabi and Ecchan. Ecchan knows in her heart that Hanabi would never return her feelings of love but she takes advantage of Hanabi&rsquo;s vulnerability to achieve her own selfish desires. In these moments between the two of them, Ecchan can pretend that their sexual relationship is a substitute for Hanabi loving her.</p>

<p>Ecchan isn&rsquo;t the only one Hanabi tries to fool around with. Hanabi attempts to seduce one of Akane&rsquo;s lovers in an attempt to mimic Akane but she ultimately fails. Hanabi mistakenly realizes that this is because Akane has such high self worth which makes people drawn to her.</p>

<p>In fact, this is something that all these characters have in common with each other. Affairs usually come out from a feeling of insecurity, which each of these characters suffer from. Akane is insecure in her own self worth and turns to others to determine and reaffirm it for her in the form of sexual attention. Hanabi, Mugi, and Ecchan use each other to satisfy their longings for others. They all seek external validation when they cannot validate themselves.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the only character in the series that realizes this before all of them (and even then, I&rsquo;m not quite sure the realization dawns upon them all), is Mugi&rsquo;s childhood friend Noriko. When she comes to terms that Mugi cannot reciprocate her feelings, she turns inward to herself and is determined to make her own self happy. The reason why this is so surprising is because her entire identity revolves around Mugi for pretty much her entire life. She is painted as a fragile doll who has had her share fair of manipulation but she still manages to move on with her life after rejection.</p>

<p>The line that Noriko says in the above picture: &ldquo;It means that the danish you get at the school store yourself can still taste good&rdquo; initially confused me. It could be because of the awkward and wordy translation but basically what Noriko is saying is that you could still find enjoyment in other things even when faced with rejection.</p>

<p>This serves as a counterpoint against Digibro&rsquo;s criticism in that these kids only seem to have their love lives going for them. I won&rsquo;t deny that it&rsquo;s true (Hanabi has no friends outside of the people she&rsquo;s sleeping with, Akane catches men partly out of boredom, and Mugi and Ecchan don&rsquo;t seem to do much either). However, this is <em>exactly why</em> their love lives became such a big deal and why it felt like the world was ending to them. They had nothing else sustaining them other than their relationships. Their quest for external validation was fruitless and they never felt any more whole than when they began. In the end, Hanabi did seem to come to this conclusion to her own after becoming involved in school activities and talking to more girls in her class, but I&rsquo;m unsure if the rest of the cast did.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this anime. The animation was gorgeous, I appreciated the voice acting, and I liked how the ending was a tad bit unconventional, even if a little bit ridiculous (yeah, I&rsquo;m looking at you Kanai). That said, this anime isn&rsquo;t for everyone. It can be dramatic to the extreme, not relatable for everyone, and the sex scenes might be a tad too much for some. I&rsquo;m a highly sympathetic person but also empathetic towards some of these characters. For me, it was a good experience that I felt like I needed. <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>!</p>

        <p>Last week was the end of final exams and on my last exam, I decided to take a well deserved day out. In celebration of Canada Day, Tim Hortons was bringing back Roll Up the Rim for a time. I&rsquo;m trying to cut down on my coffee but I decided to get at least one cup, just to try my luck. Turns out that my luck isn&rsquo;t that so great.</p>

<p>Michaels was also celebrating Canada Day a little bit early. They were giving out generous coupons for a couple of days and the end of the season meant tons of clearances on yarn.</p>

<p>I managed to grab some discontinued Loops &amp; Threads Zigzag yarn to practice my knitting with. I ended up knitting a ball. It turned out to be not that great but I see it as a learning experience.</p>

<p>After my little shopping trip I met up with Y and we went to the cat cafe that recently opened up in town. The place itself is gorgeous. The cat room was separated from the cafe. Kind of a small place but rather good when you consider what the space is used for. There were only a couple of cats there and they were all pretty lazy and hungry the whole time. Some of the cats were feeling a little playful and pounced on the feather toys. It was disappointing a bit but it was also nice being around a lot of cats.</p>

<p>Look at these kitties just sleeping and eating!</p>

<p>Overall, it was a nice day. I got to spend time with people I value, got to indulge in my hobby for a bit, and was surrounded by cats! Honestly, that&rsquo;s the dream.</p>
