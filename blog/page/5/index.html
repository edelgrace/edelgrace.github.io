<p>Not even close.</p>

<p>Some things that make as happy or happier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eating really good food</li>
<li>Having a meaningful conversation with a friend</li>
<li>Sitting in the field in my father&rsquo;s homeland looking up a starry sky</li>
<li>Listening to a good song in the window seat of a train watching the city pass by</li>
<li>Playing a video game and being absorbed in a virtual world</li>
<li>Falling asleep to the sound of rain</li>
<li>Singing along to my favourite songs</li>
<li>Watching a good TV series that can make me sob</li>
<li>Walking along the river on a sunny day</li>
<li>Going to a concert</li>
<li>Playing with really cute babies</li>
<li>Dog spotting around the city</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on and on. Sitting down with a good book is definitely on that list but it&rsquo;s not the only thing.</p>

        <p>When I turned 22 I made a bucket list of things to accomplish by the time I&rsquo;m 25. Right now I&rsquo;m 23 years old. There is a year and a half until I am 25. Let&rsquo;s see how I&rsquo;m progressing with my bucket list!</p>

<p><strong>1.Graduate from university:</strong> <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/goodbye-university/">Done!</a></p>

<p><strong>2. Move out:</strong> Still working on it! I need a full-time job first before that happens.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA:</strong> Slowly but surely. Every month I contribute a little bit to my TFSA account.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open an RRSP account:</strong> Not yet!</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full-time job in my field:</strong> Still looking! The market is tough. But I&rsquo;ve been getting more and more interviews which is a big plus.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year:</strong> A bit behind but I&rsquo;m still trying to read more often. I fell off reading a bit around March and haven&rsquo;t been able to get back on it since.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series:</strong> I restarted my playthrough because I forgot everything that had happened previously and party build was quite frankly not good.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG:</strong> I am seriously debating whether or not to continue with this. As far as I can tell, there are only three active TCGs at the moment: <a href="http://colors-tcg.eu/">Colors</a>, <a href="http://idolise.letstrade.cards/">Idolise</a>, and <a href="http://www.sakura.milkbaeri.net/">Sakura</a>. My plan was to make an Asian music TCG but there is a big overlap with Idolise, which is a K-pop TCG. Decisions, decisions&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project:</strong> Haven&rsquo;t done anything on this for a while&hellip; I need to re-evaluate where I am with this one.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website:</strong> Some progress on this one! I have the databases all set up and ready to go.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver&rsquo;s license:</strong> No progress. I am still super scared to drive.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of tech:</strong> Done! I made some friends with people who are not in Computer Science or anything IT related. Which is awesome!</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit:</strong> Some progress&hellip;? I fell off the gym wagon a bit and I&rsquo;m slowly trying to get back to it.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly:</strong> Not happening. I always forget to floss&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water:</strong> Some progress. I have a water bottle right next to me as I type this up.</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook:</strong> Some progress! I have been cooking a lot more things lately. The other day I made eggs benedict for breakfast. I&rsquo;ve been cooking chilli for dinner sometimes. I&rsquo;m going to try to make curry next time!</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family:</strong> I did it! Back in May, I went to New York City. I still haven&rsquo;t made that blog post yet. It will come, eventually. :)</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things:</strong> My clothes and books have been konmari&rsquo;d but I might need to do another pass&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time:</strong> I have a plan to get drunk eventually. It&rsquo;s on the horizon.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification:</strong> I gave up on this. Now I&rsquo;m not so sure if I want to get my CCNA after all. So&hellip; Done?</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights:</strong> This year for sure? Who knows if I&rsquo;m in the area by then.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression:</strong> Suddenly it got dark. I stopped going to my counselling sessions at the beginning of this year. I think I&rsquo;m generally doing better but it&rsquo;s definitely hard. I think I might need to rebrand my depression to &ldquo;low self-esteem issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationship:</strong> This won&rsquo;t happen until I can get a P.O. box again but I simply don&rsquo;t have the funds yet.</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert:</strong> <a href="https://edelgrace.me/blog/thoughts-on-alexisonfire-and-billy-talent">Done!</a></p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list:</strong> I think I&rsquo;m making progress? I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of movies lately but they are new releases. There&rsquo;s still a lot of movies that I need to see.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I accomplished four things since my last update and I renegotiated my priorities for one thing on my list. It&rsquo;s always good to take time to reflect on your goals and see if you&rsquo;re on track or if they still need to be a goal in the first place. Time for me to get start cracking on some plans!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hyperkinetic and relentlessly inventive, <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> is Haruki Murakami&rsquo;s deep dive into the very nature of consciousness.</p>

<p>Across two parallel narratives, Murakami draws readers into a mind-bending universe in which Lauren Bacall, Bob Dylan, a split-brained data processor, a deranged scientist, his shockingly undemure granddaughter, and various thugs, librarians, and subterranean monsters collide to a dazzling effect. What emerges is a novel that is at once hilariously funny and a deeply serious meditation on the nature and uses of the mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This novel alternates between two worlds. There is the &ldquo;Hard-Boiled Wonderland&rdquo; and &ldquo;The End of the World.&rdquo; The former takes place in reality, where the main character is racing against time to prevent &ldquo;The End of the World.&rdquo; Interestingly enough, the end of the world takes place in a single mystical village where people&rsquo;s memories of their past life do not exist. It is a utopia where everyone is assigned a task to do until the end of time.</p>

<p>After reading this novel, I came to the conclusion that I read too much Murakami. There is something similar across many of his protagonists that I just can&rsquo;t pinpoint. It&rsquo;s nothing too general like the fact that they are all men with strange thoughts about sex and women (although a lot of them do have that in common). Maybe I&rsquo;m just projecting but it seems like a large number of his protagonists are rather&hellip; Simple. Maybe even boring. They never think too strongly or feel too strongly. It seems like things are just simply happening to them and they are just bringing us along for the ride.</p>

<p>Which is why I breezed through the &ldquo;Hard-Boiled Wonderland&rdquo; chapters and absorbed &ldquo;The End of the World&rdquo; chapters as much as I could. The protagonist in &ldquo;Hard-Boiled Wonderland&rdquo; is pretty much the stereotypical Murakami leading man. In &ldquo;the End of the World,&rdquo; the protagonist is largely the same but also different.</p>

<p>There seems to be a real danger that the protagonist is trying his best to prevent. He does not want to lose his mind as he remembers it. Despite being really dull and drab in the real world, the importance of having emotions and memories is a great driving force for the protagonist. After falling in love with the emotionless librarian in the village, he is motivated to cling to his mind.</p>

<p>I was also pulled in by the fantasy aspects of &ldquo;The End of the World.&rdquo; The little village of people in an immortal land is just really interesting. I really wanted to uncover the mysteries of this world. The revelation in the novel was a bit of a disappointment but I enjoyed travelling and discovering the characters in this world.</p>

<p>However, being pulled back into reality is disappointing. While there was a real sense of urgency that I appreciated (really, I just wanted it to be over), I didn&rsquo;t feel the weight of the risk as much as the risk of never leaving &ldquo;the End of the World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really seem to make my mind up about this novel. I think this might be one of the better Murakami books but it still isn&rsquo;t great. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t reread this book, like I would say, <em>Norweigan Wood</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever had a bookish, nocturnal dream? If so, please share the story. If not, have you ever had a daydream related to books? If so, please tell us about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strangely enough, I can&rsquo;t think of any bookish dreams. When I dream, they are usually patchwork of my own memories (isn&rsquo;t every dream). Depending on my mental state, I can have either really great dreams that are basically my wants being visualized in a dream or the complete opposite of the world ending by some apocalyptic event.</p>

<p>Even though I try to picture scenes when I read books (and the really good books can make me picture things really vividly), I feel like they aren&rsquo;t concrete enough for that imagery in my head to appear in my dreams.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve probably had dreams about me being in libraries. Probably when I was younger when I libraries were more of a constant in my life. I still go to the library these days too, but I&rsquo;m usually not focused on the books. I like to sit at the desk in the library and apply for jobs or concentrate on a side project or learn something. Sometimes I do browse around for books. Unfortunately, the library stacks at my local library don&rsquo;t leave a strong impression. I still think about my elementary school&rsquo;s library fondly. The tall wooden shelves filled to the brim with books is a comforting memory.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is not a concert review and this post contains swearing</p>

<p>One of the things on my <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/25-before-25/">25 before 25 bucket list</a> was to go see a concert. The last concert I went to when I made my bucket list was the Japanese band <em>Lix</em> at an anime convention back in 2012 (but that slipped my mind when I wrote it and I said the last concert I went to was a <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/my-chemical-romance-in-concert/">My Chemical Romance concert</a>). Technically I already fulfilled this earlier in the year when I saw a video game cover band at the same anime convention but for some reason I don&rsquo;t really count that as a real concert.</p>

<p>However, this month I saw a bunch of concerts thanks to the Calgary Stampede&rsquo;s Coca-Cola Stage. Every year my city hosts a stage where musicians perform at for 10 days. Usually I skip out on it because I don&rsquo;t like any of the musicians that attend. However, this year they came out with the news that the bands Alexisonfire and Billy Talent were coming and I knew that I just had to go.</p>

<h2 id="alexisonfire">Alexisonfire</h2>

<p>I watched a lot of <em>Much Music</em> on TV as a kid, which is essentially Canada&rsquo;s equivalent of MTV. What I really liked about <em>Much Music</em> was that they featured a lot of Canadian artists and a lot of bands. I&rsquo;ve always been a rocker at heart and I was so glad that they were diverse and played bands alongside the more mainstream pop musicians. Now that I think about it, the mid/late 2000&rsquo;s seemed like a better time for bands but that&rsquo;s beside the point.</p>

<p>Every week there would be a countdown of that week&rsquo;s hits. Back in 2006, I distinctly remember watching Alexisonfire climbing the charts all the way up to number one with their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPcds3jOhRQ"><em>This Could be Anywhere in the World</em></a>. I tried to listen to their previous works but back then I had very little tolerance to screaming in songs and their newer songs were more melodic. Most of the songs that I liked by Alexisonfire was from their <em>Crisis</em> album.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2015 that I delved into their discography again. They somehow got on my recommended on YouTube and I was hit by nostalgia. My taste in music had definitely changed since 2006 and I found a new appreciation for both the screaming vocals and the clean vocals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of all the music I&rsquo;ve been listening to since the end of 2010 and you can really see that sudden 2015 spike. I was riding the Alexisonfire phase until about 2017. I think I would attribute the 2018 spike to the news that Alexisonfire was coming to my city, where I was just hyping myself up for my favourite songs and listening to more of their discography just in case they played any unfamiliar songs.</p>

<p>My friends and I ran up to the area where Alexisonfire was playing about an hour and a half before the concert started. I saw that they put up barriers pretty early. Initially I didn&rsquo;t know what the barriers were for but later I learned it was for keeping the mosh pit contained. So my friends and I were right up against the barrier before the crowd turned into the mosh pit section. We were fairly close to the stage but not quite enough for my short self to see past the sea of tall people.</p>

<p>That didn&rsquo;t matter too much to me. What I really came to hear was the music. I also really wanted to see George Petit (the screaming vocalist) in the flesh at least once.</p>

<p>They ended up playing a lot of my favourite songs (except for maybe two or three). They started off with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8nIv56qKhM"><em>Young Cardinals</em></a> which kicked things off really well. It was great whenever they handed off the singing to the crowd. It gave me goosebumps listening to everyone around me and barely myself singing along. It just got me hyped. Next, they did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgkMlEn8L2E"><em>Boiled Frogs</em></a>. This is one of my favourite singles from 2006.</p>

<p>One of George&rsquo;s strong points is hyping up the crowd. When they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6SK3CrVWko"><em>We Are the Sound</em></a> I screamed my heart out whenever George prompted the crowd to, &ldquo;repeat after me!&rdquo; Another example is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=993hs8m1J40"><em>Dog&rsquo;s Blood</em></a>, which isn&rsquo;t one of my favourite songs ever. I was reading people&rsquo;s comments about the concert after and one poster said at one point in the song, they learned over to their girlfriend and said to her, &ldquo;After this, George will say &lsquo;<em>Now fuck this place up</em>!&lsquo;&rdquo; He says that in every performance of <em>Dog&rsquo;s Blood</em> but I don&rsquo;t care, it&rsquo;s fucking hype anyway!</p>

<p>There were a couple of songs that they played that I wasn&rsquo;t too familiar with (<em>Crisis</em>, <em>Accept Crime</em>, <em>Drunks, Lovers, Sinners and Saints</em>) but those were still really great songs to just headbang and groove to.</p>

<p>Of course, they played <em>This Could Be Anywhere in the World</em> as their &ldquo;last&rdquo; song. It was absolutely amazing. That&rsquo;s hands down their most well-known song. The girl to my left was really quiet the entire concert but once this song started, she was just all into it. That&rsquo;s one of my favourite things about concerts: when everyone is just freaking out over really good songs by a really good band that they all love.</p>

<p>The encore was what got me the most though. Most notably, they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwXSwbX_NqI"><em>Pulmonary Archery</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ0Zncg7sLQ"><em>Accidents</em></a>. When I heard the opening riff of <em>Accidents</em>, I yelled &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; and threw my hand in the air. I don&rsquo;t know the lyrics to <em>Accidents</em> really well but I screamed my heart out to what I thought Dallas Green was singing. Right now I&rsquo;m listening to the song and just reliving it. I screamed &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s redefine&rdquo; so hard my throat started to hurt. That was the absolute highlight of the concert for me.</p>

<p>Even weeks later, I&rsquo;m still a little bit in a daze of seeing Alexisonfire live. I got to see George Petit&rsquo;s head pop a couple of times and saw him tear off his shirt. I saw Chris Steele briefly go across the stage deliriously. I witnessed a dude in a wheelchair crowd surfing. Wade McNeil yelled at some crowd surfer blocking the view of the stage and cemented the fact that he is probably the coolest and kindest dude in the band. It was just a whole lot of fun. I am still so extremely happy that I got to see them live.</p>

<h2 id="billy-talent">Billy Talent</h2>

<p>Billy Talent is a bit of a different story. At first I was a little bit hesitant to see Billy Talent because I&rsquo;m not a big Billy Talent fan. I also got into Billy Talent in 2006 so they still had a bit of a nostalgia factor to me. 2006 was when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv5kkI5X1QM">*Devil in a Midnight Mass</a> came out and I really liked that song. They came out with a lot of singles off their 2006 album <em>Billy Talent II</em> that I really liked. I also liked the singles off their previous self-titled <em>Billy Talent</em> album. However after that, Billy Talent fell off my radar and I just listened to those singles over and over again.</p>

<p>2006 was right around that middle school age and that was when I was probably at my edgiest. Billy Talent had a lot of relatable songs that are comparable to Linkin Park&rsquo;s songs in their hay day. That was a big reason why I was drawn to Billy Talent. I could emotionally connect to a lot of their songs.</p>

<p>You can see that in 2016 I only listened to two songs by Billy Talent. In 2016, Billy Talent came out with the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-3Ms3m34"><em>Afraid of Heights</em></a> and I decided to give it a listen. Evidently I didn&rsquo;t like it that much back then because I only listened to it once and to one other song from the album.</p>

<p>When I learned that Billy Talent was coming to Calgary, I decided to try to listen to more of their songs. I eventually grew to like <em>Afraid of Heights</em> and I rediscovered <strong>a lot</strong> of Billy Talent songs I used to love when I was younger.</p>

<p><strong>Compared to Alexisonfire</strong></p>

<p>For the first four years, I listened to just slightly more Billy Talent compared to Alexisonfire. I think this is because there were more songs I liked by Billy Talent. When it came to Alexisonfire, I only liked a couple of songs, maybe four at the most, but I played them a lot. Of course, 2015 changed how I listened to Alexisonfire.</p>

<p>2014 or 2015 was around when I started to use Spotify so I was listening less and less to my personal music library. I essentially rebuilt my music library from scratch through the Spotify catalogue. Billy Talent did not make the cut but Alexisonfire did.</p>

<p>Obviously, in 2018 pre and post-concert I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of Billy Talent. Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll be listening to Billy Talent more than Alexisonfire in the future.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much from the concert because I never saw myself as a big fan of Billy Talent. But I was <em>amazed</em> at how many songs I recognized at the concert. They played some of my favourite classics like <em>Devil in a Midnight Mass</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lc-mkZXPao"><em>The Ex</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPCMx8yS7c0"><em>Try Honesty</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8zR30qTd8Y"><em>River Below</em></a>. They also played some recent songs that I didn&rsquo;t really know but liked enough to headbang to.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNhPb_BPfLA"><em>This is How it Goes</em></a> is one of those songs that wasn&rsquo;t familiar with but when they played it, I just lost myself to the music. Later I found out this song was written after the drummer, Aaron Solowoniuk, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The song had a good amount of &ldquo;fuck it, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck anymore&rdquo; that resonated with me.</p>

<p>The encore was the real banger though. I can get why bands save the really good songs for the encore but damn. I am <em>so</em> happy they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2UktJtKpFw"><em>Red Flag</em></a>. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it but they did it! I screamed out the chorus every single time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg63uxYwN0"><em>Fallen Leaves</em></a> is another one of my favourites. I never saw it as a show closer but oh man, now I understand why they ended it with that song. It has a similar sentiment to Alexisonfire&rsquo;s <em>This Could be Anywhere in the World</em>, of being disgruntled about the place you currently live in and seeing nothing but corruption everywhere.</p>

<p>Ben, the vocalist for Billy Talent, made a really great effort to connect to the crowd. Like Alexisonfire, they commented about coming back to Calgary after so many years which was really nice to hear. Also similar to Alexisonfire, Ben stressed about being inclusive to everyone and had a spiel about loving everyone no matter their background.</p>

<p>Something that was pretty cool was that one of the sound technicians had a birthday that day and Ben passed a cake through the crowd from the front of the stage back to where the sound booth was. My friends and I watched the cake float through the crowd. One time the cake almost fell. I&rsquo;m glad the band trusted us with that cake.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an awesome concert. I screamed a lot more at that concert than the Alexisonfire concert, partly because Billy Talent songs are a lot more singable for someone who can&rsquo;t do screamo vocals. I feel a little unfair for comparing this concert to the Alexisonfire concert (one of my friends said he heard someone else talking about how &ldquo;Alexisonfire had way more people than this&rdquo;) especially when the two bands have the same touring drummer, Jordan Hastings. But these two bands were both prominent in my early life right around the same time. They really defined the Canadian rock landscape in the early/mid-2000&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s amazing that they can still draw huge crowds and are (in Billy Talent&rsquo;s case) making new music.</p>

<p>In the end, I enjoyed Billy Talent and Alexisonfire for different reasons. My junior high self would have loved seeing Billy Talent live. My current self is just so glad I got to see Alexisonfire. I am still grateful that I got to see both of them. I will hopefully never stop listening to these two bands. I think I will always be able to listen to my favourite songs and rock out to them.</p>
