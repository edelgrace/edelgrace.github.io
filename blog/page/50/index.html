        <p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was listening to an episode of a certain podcast yesterday, which was recorded around the time when Andy got a tumblr and started stirring the pot with the SJ fan community. Dylan was trying to steer away the conversation from using ableism terms and Barb told Dylan that he had &ldquo;So much to learn about the world.&rdquo; That made me legitimately angry and sad because I really love Barb but no, you also have a lot to learn too. I wish I could be that blissfully and purposefully ignorant of all the problematic things that are going on in this world.</li>
<li>Sometimes I wish there were &ldquo;readme for newbies&rdquo; version for 99% of the readme files on GitHub because I’m really not that great at reading documentation and most readme files assume that I already know something but I don&rsquo;t and I never know what it is that I should know because I don’t know it in the first place.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m watching FMA again because I still haven&rsquo;t watched Brotherhood. The only thing that might disappoint me about Brotherhood is that I think L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel isn’t on the soundtrack. Like FMA was THE reason why I listen to Japanese music today and I would be a whole different person if it wasn&rsquo;t for FMA and L&rsquo;Arc.<br />
Remember in media studies class I wrote an essay about FMA and my teacher read it out loud because she thought it was so good hahahaha good thing 90% of the class were my friends.</li>

<li><p>During one of my calculus lectures, we had just finished solving a problem and a girl asked my prof, &ldquo;What does this number mean?&rdquo; and my prof replied with, &ldquo;It means nothing. It’s just a number.&rdquo; The girl was getting all flustered but then my prof goes on to say, &ldquo;YOU are the ones who give it meaning. You are the chemists and computer scientists. I just give you the tools for you to use in your major.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To be honest, this is high school math in a nut shell. People go on about how high school math is useless because they&rsquo;ll never need to integrate a curve but of course math will be useless to you if you don’t apply it appropriately. Ok, most people probably won’t need to know how to find the gradient of a vector if you’re a plumber or a lawyer but math IS useful in many fields. The math you learn in high school builds a foundation of skills for you if you ever need to take higher math which WILL more than likely be used in a way that will be helpful to you.</p>

<p>I just really love this calc prof. I’ve had him twice and he&rsquo;s hands down one of my favourite profs at this university so far.</p></li>

<li><p>One time I went to park with my cousin who&rsquo;s 8 and I was pushing him on the swing and he practically yelled, &ldquo;Do one big ass push!!!&rdquo; Of course, a parent nearby just gave us the death stare and I didn’t say anything but I think I should have said something like, &ldquo;Cousin, watch your language!&rdquo; I’m going to be a horrible parent if I ever become one.</p></li>

        <p>I&rsquo;m now in my third year of university. That&rsquo;s an extremely scary thought for me, haha. High school seems like it was just yesterday (to be fair, it was only two years ago). Despite this being my third year, this is technically my middle year. I switched majors which added year to my degree. I&rsquo;ve already done two years and after I finish this year, I have two more years to go. So here I am: at the half way point.</p>

<p>The first week&hellip; Could have gone better, I guess? On the first day, I had a brutally long break in between my first and last class (4 hours!!) due to there being no tutorials in the first week. I also fell down the busiest staircase on campus. Okay, I didn&rsquo;t fall down the stairs as in actually going down the stairs but I fell down <strong>on</strong> the stairs. My legs felt like they were frozen and I couldn&rsquo;t move them so I sat there for a couple of minutes while one of my classmates stood by awkwardly. Yeah, that was embarassing. My legs still hurt from that&hellip; My calves kill me whenever I go up and down stairs!</p>

<p>My classes this year are okay, so far. I&rsquo;m taking an Arabic language class. I&rsquo;m pretty excited and completely nervous over learning a new language. I think the Arabic writing system is beautiful and I think it would be nice to learn some of the culture associated with Arabic as well. We didn&rsquo;t really start learning anything until Friday and to be honest, it was so intimidating! There are a couple of people in my class that already have some knowledge of Arabic and I feel like I&rsquo;m already behind! We were going over letter combinations, trying to pronounce them and we were going around the class. Some people said the word even before I had time to figure out what the first two letters sounded like! My confidence level seriously deflated, haha. But I&rsquo;ll give it until the end of the week before I decide if I want to stay in the class.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also in a first year statistics course and it&rsquo;s amusing seeing the freshman trying to figure things out on the first day. My professor has a super strong accent, which can be off-putting for some, but hopefully we&rsquo;ll just get used to it. To be honest, I think I&rsquo;m already used to it!</p>

<p>In one of my computer science courses, I have a professor that I&rsquo;ve previously had before. There&rsquo;s a lot of weird coincidences with this class! When I first took it with her, the course number was 231 and the section I was in was T05-1. Now, the course number is 331 and the section I&rsquo;m in is T01-5! If you follow my Twitter, you might have already seen me make this observation, haha.</p>

<p>This professor loves group work and she&rsquo;s pretty creative in constructing the course. We were given a survey of sorts to take while she took the results and put us in groups according to our answers. So far I like my group! They all seem very friendly and hard workers. I hate group work but sometimes it can be a blessing, I guess.</p>

<p>One of the good things that happened this week was that my friend gave me a little gift he brought from his trip to Hong Kong and the Philippines! He bought me a Mayday CD from Hong Kong. They&rsquo;re a super cool Taiwanese band and I&rsquo;m pretty much in love with the lead singer. It&rsquo;s a live concert/movie soundtrack CD. They&rsquo;re pretty good live except sometimes the vocalist gets really nasally. Other than that, I love it!</p>

<p>Before I finish this post, I have one more observation to make. Oh my goodness, the university is so crowded! I took Spring and Summer courses (June to August) and there weren&rsquo;t many people around then. I was so used to the university being a ghost town and now that I&rsquo;m back to the regular school year, it feels like there&rsquo;s too many people. I totally prefer Spring and Summer over Fall and Winter!</p>

<p>And with that I should probably get to sleep (8 AM classes with an ~1.5 hour commute does not make a happy camper). Let&rsquo;s hope for a good week!</p>

        <p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was mailing out letters one day and there&rsquo;s this guy at the mall who works at a knives store. He has a sweet mohawk. I was sitting nearby putting stamps on envelopes and an old lady asked him if she could touch his hair. It was kinda cute but at the same time I wonder if he was annoyed but he sounded really cheerful about it, so maybe not? It really made my day.</li>
<li>My biggest pet peeve in Assassin&rsquo;s Creed is when people dismiss Those Who Came Before as silly space time wizard ghosts. I can’t be the only one, right?? There much more than that! There&rsquo;s not really ghosts but holograms, in a way. Bits of their consciousness is stored as data. Think of it as a really complex AI.</li>
<li>In Mass Effect &ldquo;4&rdquo; I just want to talk more. Like, I want to learn more about different Alien cultures. I want to do nice stuff for random people, even if it’s just talking them through decisions and not going to the ends of the universe for them. For example, the little side mission with that one &ldquo;couple&rdquo; on the citadel who were debating whether or not they wanted to undergo gene therapy for the unborn child. I also want to eavesdrop on conversations. I want to hear mundane stuff like &ldquo;Did you hear about X in accounting? He’s getting married&hellip; To an ASARI.&rdquo; I want to hear game relevant stuff like &ldquo;I heard that if you go to this planet, you can get Y model of armor&rdquo; or &ldquo;there’s a rumour that Z is hiding in the W solar system.&rdquo; There are a lot of other things I want in ME4 but like&hellip; Dialogue choices!! I hope ME4 will be amazing, bioware please don’t let me down.</li>
<li>I took an ethics course and our prof was so hard on us when it came to the topic of eating meat. Every single argument we could come up with FOR eating meat, he tore them apart and exposed every single flaw in them. Then he gave his arguments AGAINST eating meat and they were so convincing and almost untouchable. I just CANNOT justify eating meat anymore but I still do it anyway. I just feel extremely guilty whenever I eat meat now.</li>
<li>When I was in elementary school I tried to make an Alyson Stoner guild on Neopets except I couldn’t say &ldquo;Alyson Stoner&rdquo; in the description because Neopets kept censoring me. It kept telling me I couldn’t use that word and at that point I was innocent enough to not know why her name was a bad word.</li>

        <p>I only have one link today, that&rsquo;s the blog <a href="http://altairandvega.net">Altair &amp; Vega</a>.</p>

<p>Altair &amp; Vega is an <em>extremely</em> insightful blog that delves deep into the narrative and art of many popular anime and manga titles. They have a group of multiple authors and while their posts aren&rsquo;t regular, when they do show up on my news feed, it&rsquo;s a great treat.</p>

<p>I forget how I originally got to this site. I probably stumbled upon it through the post on the anime Hyouka, <a href="http://altairandvega.net/2012/07/15/and-you-dont-doubt-your-own-satoshi-fukube-a-character-study/">&ldquo;And You Don&rsquo;t Doubt Your Own?&rdquo; Satoshi Fukube, A Character Study</a>. Despite the fact that it makes a very problematic and most likely false claim saying that Fukube is in love/obsessed with Oreki, it is an incredibly interesting read. Speculating on someone&rsquo;s sexuality is something that should never be okay. In most contexts, it implies the use of applying harmful stereotypes that only further perpetuates them. Thankfully, this article steers clear of this. Instead, it focuses on the behaviour of the characters in the relationship and how the medium portrays these behaviours.</p>

<p>The analysis of Fukube and Oreki&rsquo;s friendship is great in itself, but it&rsquo;s the conclusion that rubs me the wrong way. There seems to be a trend towards assuming that a deep and meaningful friendship suggests that one of the parties sees the other as more than &ldquo;just a friend.&rdquo; In reality, that is not the case. One can be in a shallow and superficial relationship and harbour romantic feelings towards the other person. However, I think the main culprit here is (other than the fact that people <em>love</em> their shipping<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-818" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-818">1</a></sup>) the fact that Oreki and Fukube are both middle school boys. Very rarely do we see friendships between two boys in media where the relationship scratches more than the surface. Two boys sharing their feelings on life and insecurities instead of playing basketball or doing laps around the neighbourhood? Nah, they must be gay.</p>

<p>While this accusation is pretty harsh, I don&rsquo;t necessarily accuse nor blame Altair &amp; Vega for it. In fact, I&rsquo;m extremely glad they wrote this article. As I said before, the analysis of their relationship is superb. They point out specific artistic choices that allude to a certain aspect to their characters I could have never come up with myself (mainly, the shot of Fukube shrouded in darkness while he and Oreki are discussing a &ldquo;rose coloured&rdquo; life blew my mind).</p>

<p>Another article I love to read over and over again is <a href="http://altairandvega.net/2013/01/10/paradise-kiss-and-the-art-of-self-deprecation/">Paradise Kiss and the Art of Self Deprecation</a>. Paradise Kiss is a manga and anime that is very near and dear to my heart. Across my many sites, I love to say that <a href="http://books.mazohyst.org/i-have-an-ai-yazawa-addiction/">Ai Yazawa is one of my favourite mangaka(s?)</a> in the entire industry and I love each and every one of her works. Yazawa has a talent for tapping into the teenaged girl psyche (which doesn&rsquo;t sound that hard but, ugh, she does it so well). I saw myself in Yukari and I sympathized with from start to finish. But like&hellip; <em>The Art of Self Deprecation.</em> This article nails it perfectly. Just read it for yourself.</p>

        <p><strong>Warning: Implied misogynistic content, alluding to the USBC shootings, and mentions of rape.</strong></p>

<p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I&rsquo;ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was listening to an episode of the Internet Box, which was recorded around the time when Andrew got a Tumblr and started stirring the pot with the social justice fan community. Dylon was trying to steer away the conversation from using ableism terms and Barbara told Dylon that he has &ldquo;So much to learn about the world.&rdquo; That made me legitimately angry and sad because I really love Barbara but no, Barbara there a couple of things you have a lot to learn too. I wish I could be that blissfully and purposefully ignorant of all the things that my friends and I do that are harmful. In the famous words of Burnie Burns, &ldquo;God dammit Barbara.&rdquo;</li>
<li>My prof asked who was going to watch Maleficent and then he asked if anyone was going to see it because of Angelina Jolie and I think I was the only one who put up their hand??? In a history of video games class filled with mostly males I am confused but also slightly pleased.</li>

<li><p>&ldquo;College is a time when everyone experiences things such as sex, and fun, and pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Idk, I hate how there are people who think this a guaranteed and mandatory and expected &ldquo;college experience.&rdquo; I mean I know &ldquo;fun&rdquo; is objective but I’m pretty sure in this context it means &ldquo;partying&rdquo; and &ldquo;clubbing&rdquo; but college isn’t just that, there are other ways of having fun too.</p>

<p>And god, this guy is just so… So full of it. This video makes me sick to my stomach. We don’t owe people our affections and we don’t &ldquo;deny&rdquo; anyone to a happy life. Wow I’m having a hard time of sympathizing with this guy (which I&rsquo;m not trying to do but he&rsquo;s trying to get us to do). He takes the friendzone to the extreme I can’t wrap my head around how there are people who actually think this way. It just sickens me that people died over this. this is not ok.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay this one is too long to put under a bullet point.</p>

<p>I honestly love Nintendo because they’ve been doing their own thing ever since they got into the video industry. Before no one really cared about bugs in their games but then Nintendo came along and demanded all of their programmers to go through rigorous testing. They controlled what games could or could not be released on their platform (preventing things like <em>Custer&rsquo;s Revenge</em> which was basically a rape simulator for the Atari 2600 made by a porn company). Because of this (and their good games of course) they single-handedly revived the video game industry in the 70s/80s (my prof would be disappointed reading this).</p>

<p>It kinda makes me sad to see them going on a downhill but they are honestly stuck in the old times and very much set in their traditional values and people thought it was unthinkable then, but it’s even more unthinkable now. Although you gotta hand it to them for sticking to their guns. Now I totally get why nintendo does the backward things they do.</p>

<p>And yeah this rant came about because I was totally listening to The Patch. Every week they talk about something that I’m learning in class. Last week they were talking about arcade games and this week they’re talking about Nintendo. I love hearing current &ldquo;news&rdquo; about the things I’m learning it makes things that much more interesting.</p>

<p>TL;DR I&rsquo;m not so surprised about nintendo’s “backwardness” anymore when that’s what they’ve been for the entirety of their existence and once (maybe more than once idk yet??) it actually worked out for them.</p>
