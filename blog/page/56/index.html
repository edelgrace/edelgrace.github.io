        <p>Okay I admittedly watch too many videos on YouTube when I should be doing school things but I really like looking for videos of U-KISS. I find it to be so embarrassing that I am a fan. I have to watch metal<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-210" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-210">1</a></sup> music videos afterwards to <strike>regain my manliness</strike> get rid of that sickly sweet aftertaste in my mouth that I get when I look, hear, or even think about at U-KISS. If you don&rsquo;t know who U-KISS are, keep it that way and bless your innocent soul.</p>

<p>If (god forbid) you want to know who they are anyway, U-KISS is a Korean boy group. If you still don&rsquo;t understand, they&rsquo;re kinda like (and I cringe when I say this) One Direction. They&rsquo;re essentially really cute boys who dance and sing and some times rap. Now, I&rsquo;m mostly not ashamed to admit that I like Korean pop but the only boy group I really listen to is Big Bang. They&rsquo;re bad ass. U-KISS? They&rsquo;re all bubblegum and fairies. That&rsquo;s the main reason why I&rsquo;m so embarrassed to be a Kiss Me<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-210" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-210">2</a></sup>. Fairies and stuff. :(</p>

<p>But seriously though. U-KISS.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>But actually, screw U-KISS right now because I just discovered (or rediscovered) some beautiful bands.</p>

<p>12012</p>

<p>UnsraW</p>

<p>Boris</p>

<p>SCREW</p>

<p>sadie</p>

<p>-OZ-</p>

<p>DEATHGAZE</p>

<p>There are too many good bands out there. :( How could I possibly even listen to all of them??</p>

<p><li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_1-210"></a>i.e. DIR EN GREY, Versailles, SCREW&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_1-210"></a>

        <p>The sun cleared up his eyes and I was instantly lost.</p>

<p>Even when his head turned towards mine</p>

<p>I could not and would not tear mine away from his.</p>

<p>That colour!</p>

<p>I had never experienced it before.</p>

<p>Warm and clear.</p>

<p>I could see forever in his eyes.</p>

<p>I could feel his disappointment</p>

<p>when he looked into mine: an endless dirt pit.</p>

<p>But he smiled at me then, a sweet crooked grin</p>

<p>accompanied by an equally sweet pair of crooked teeth.</p>

<p>A cat-like curl and a crooked grin.</p>

<p>I had never experienced these colours before.</p>

<p>I really wish I could be able to write poems! Poems are beautiful but like I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;m not a writer. Writers have an innate ability to know and feel words and I definitely do not have that. I tried guys, I tried<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-203" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-203">1</a></sup>. If you&rsquo;re wondering what this is about, it&rsquo;s about a random encounter I had while on campus in my freshman year. I hate how encounters on campus are random. Come back, mystery guy!</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m seriously fading in motivation. I just feel really down all of a sudden and all of the time. But then I remember AJ from U-KISS and I remember that he goes to Columbia and works his butt off (I hope). AJ, please give me inspiration!! And yeah, Eat Your Kimchi has officially converted me into a Kiss Me. I have mixed feelings. Be right back while I go blast some acid android and DIR EN GREY. Maybe with some Sadie and SCREW in the mix. I need more SCREW songs. And I have an album that I have yet to give a full listen through by DIR EN GREY. I&rsquo;m so behind in my music! I wish I had money to buy music. ;A; I need a job but I need good grades. Whaaaat is life?</p>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t really know what to write about in my blog right now. At first I was like &ldquo;post everyday!&rdquo; but when I got to it, I drew a blank. Not to mention, the 500 words requirement overwhelms me. What can I write about for 500 words??That&rsquo;s why I already missed more than four days of posting. A &ldquo;blog post idea&rdquo; list would be very hand right now. I gotta start writing down said ideas. So I resort to using fictional writing prompts for today&rsquo;s post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Write a scene that starts with the line, &ldquo;Short? SHORT?&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;Sarah Selecky Prompts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Short? SHORT?&rdquo; Daniel bellowed as he held his wallet in one hand and two crumpled bills in the other. &ldquo;The sign said it was only $0.99!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lips of the cashier&rsquo;s mouth tugged at the corners. &ldquo;The sign is for a different product. Many customers have already said the same thing. I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she shrugged and waved the burrito in the air. &ldquo;Do you have another way to pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daniel stared down at his two dollar bills. &ldquo;This is all the money I have,&rdquo; he mumbled. He looked back up at the cashier with pleading eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been walking on foot for days, I need food. Please. I&rsquo;ll take anything for two dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the cashier shook her head. The two stood there for a couple of moments, staring at each other before another customer coughed from behind Daniel.</p>

<p>He gave up. He stuffed his money back into his wallet. On the way out from the gas station, he glanced longingly at a bag of chips and lingered there for a second. The thought appeared in his mind but he pushed it out as soon as it came. He left the store empty handed and with an empty stomach.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m a victim of the 140 characters. Okay, sometimes I like to say things that are more than 140 characters but you know what I mean, yeah? Tumblr (not Twitter) has conditioned me to want to share my thoughts every time they pop into my head. Fortunately, I don&rsquo;t have Tumblr anymore. Unfortunately, I do have a Twitter. Fortunately, I don&rsquo;t want to use my Twitter<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-177" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-177">1</a></sup> too much because I have only six followers who probably don&rsquo;t care about me at all.</p>

<p>However, I do want to release my thoughts to the wild in some sort of fashion instead of keeping it trapped in my brain where it will be lost eventually. So, here they are.</p>

<ul>
<li>The PS4 came out just yesterday. My friend&rsquo;s friend went to a midnight launch and won a Vita. Lucky duck.</li>
<li>The only reason why I&rsquo;d ever get the PS4 is to play WATCH_DOGS and AC4. I swear I&rsquo;m not a Ubisoft fangirl.</li>
<li>Seriously though, console wars are really stupid. Just pick a console and play it. Who cares what other people buy??</li>
<li>I finished reading <em>Lolita</em> today. &ldquo;Lolita is quite possibly the most beautiful and twisted book I have ever read. Nabokov is a genius&hellip; I had to put down Lolita after barely reading a paragraph because it was too beautifully written for me to handle. Goosebumps everywhere.</li>
<li>I think Arryn<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-177" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-177">2</a></sup> is just an all around adorable girl. It&rsquo;s even more adorable how she fangirls over Miles<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-177" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-177">3</a></sup> on her Tumblr.</li>
<li>The layout for erzadel.net/blog has been tweaked slightly. The title and page/post headings are now centered. Also, fixed alignment with the footnotes and made them just a tad smaller.</li>
<li>Today we put up the Christmas tree. My brother refused to do it for half an hour because he was playing LoL. I wish he never started playing LoL. Now he doesn&rsquo;t want to do anything because if he leaves in the middle of a game, he&rsquo;ll get banned. Lame rules.</li>
<li>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about the new YouTube comment system is the fact that I can&rsquo;t reply to old comments.</li>
<li>I watched a little bit of Mike&rsquo;s MLP Season 3 stream&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t make it through. However, it was only because I was watching Joel and Adam play Cry of Fear.</li>
<li>Vera Wang is really pretty. I wish I would look that good when I&rsquo;m older.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been on a &ldquo;What Would You Do?&rdquo; binge on YouTube. :(</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I <em>completely</em> missed the last two posts entirely. I didn&rsquo;t even start a draft or anything! I&rsquo;m just really frustrated because this reading week has not be as busy as I would have liked it to be. I ended up watching an embarrassing amount of YouTube videos. I will try to list them all in somewhat order.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rose by Lee Hi<br />
This kid was 16 years old when she made this song. She is so talented for someone so young! I love her husky voice and jazzy/soulful sound. Honestly, she&rsquo;s super adorable too. She looks like a Lolita-type doll. So innocent and cherub-like!</li>
<li>Versailles guitar solos<br />
Thinking about roses and Lolitas made me think of Versailles. I went through a big Versailles phase for a couple of months. I love their symphonic power metal sound. Intense but beautiful!</li>
<li>Weird gothic metal<br />
How different is that from Versailles? Not much. I wanted to find some similar sounding bands to Versailles. For some reason, English-speaking symphonic bands sound silly to me?? I don&rsquo;t understand how I can take Japanese men in drag more seriously than typical English speaking metal heads. I think it might have to do with the vocalists being a bit more on the higher side with a country crooning sound to them.</li>
<li>Frank Sinatra Jr.<br />
He was such a babe when he was younger. Rawr. But no really, 19-year-old Junior? <em>Swoon.</em> He&rsquo;s sooo adorkable. That hair. Those lips. If I was born in that time I&rsquo;d want to be a groupie, no joke. I do have to say though that his voice was definitely better when he was younger.</li>
<li>Sandara Park in the Philippines<br />
I don&rsquo;t know how I got to the topic of Korean artists speaking different languages. Sandara Park (from Korean girl group 2NE1) lived in the Philippines for a while and actually had a career there so she can speak in English (with a thick but adorable Filipino accent) and in Tagalog as well. I just love watching her in the Philippines and speaking Tagalog because I feel like I relate to her even though I don&rsquo;t even speak Tagalog.</li>
<li>Documentaries of Romany people in Russia<br />
One of my OCs<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-173" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-173">1</a></sup> is half Romany and half Eurasian/Asian (I have yet to iron out the details) but I haven&rsquo;t done enough research to his Romany side. Much of his Romany side is stereotypes and cliches and I just felt like it was a poor description of him. So, research it is!</li>
<li>Documentaries about the Japan tsunami in 2011<br />
With the typhoon and earthquakes hitting close to home, I searched a video for the ground actually moving apart. I found a lot from Japan and one thing led to another. In particular, I watched a documentary called &ldquo;Children of the Tsunami.&rdquo; As you can tell, many tears were shed. This one girl wrote a diary about her fears of radiation since she was living so close to Fukushima. She read from it and talked about it with her dad by her side. She said that she didn&rsquo;t want to talk about her fears to her parents and that&rsquo;s why she wrote in her diary. The look on the father&rsquo;s face was just so painful I immediately teared up. So many of the kids who survived wanted to become people who would save lives and prevent such disasters from happening again. It was touching.</li>
<li>Who Do You Think You Are?<br />
There&rsquo;s this BBC show that features celebrities finding out more about their roots. I watched snippets of a lot of episodes but the only one I watched from beginning to end was the episode with J.K. Rowling in it. She&rsquo;s a gorgeous woman and I was immediately enraptured by her family&rsquo;s tale. I even became fond of her ancestors and it was just lovely to watch.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mixed&rdquo; People Testimonials<br />
Since my OC is mixed, I wanted to see if there are any half Romany people on YouTube. Not the case but there are a lot of other type of mixed people on YouTube! I have to admit too, a lot of mixed people are really attractive, especially half Asians. Cut pale girls with jet black hair? <em>Swoon.</em></li>
