        <div class="tags">
            <ul>
              
              <li><a href="/categories/internet">Internet</a></li>

        <p>I have been listening to &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; by Jeff &amp; Casey Lee Williams nonstop all day. I just love it. It makes me want to dance around and sing. It also makes me feel very warm and fuzzy inside. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve listened to a song that makes me that gushy. I just can&rsquo;t get over the funky discos vibe. Those guitar licks and the strings and Casey&rsquo;s voice&hellip; It&rsquo;s seriously too much to love!</p>

<p>On another note, man, I&rsquo;m already finding that writing a blog post everyday is hard. I don&rsquo;t have any topics! I guess I could do a reflection each day and record what happened explicitly. I&rsquo;ve always loved reading diaries that recounted events. In fact, that&rsquo;s mostly what I&rsquo;ve been defining a blog as: recounting my days.</p>

<p>This morning, I had to write a midterm in my Russian course. It was really brutal, I think. I wish I had studied a little bit more. I think I did okay but definitely not as good as I wanted. Fingers crossed that I passed!</p>

<p>For the next three hours (I have a three hour break between lectures) I worked on my thesis and outline on my Heart of a Dog paper. It was a painful three hours.</p>

<p>Then I had computer science lecture. I found myself falling asleep almost. I need more sleep. We learned more about GUIs and my mind just shut down. My TA walked over and told us that we didn&rsquo;t do so well on our last exercise. News I didn&rsquo;t want to hear. In the words of my fellow group member, &ldquo;We have to step up our game for next time!&rdquo; Ughh.</p>

<p>Bad news after bad news. I went to my ADS to go over my outline for a paper and I just complete missed the mark on everything. I&rsquo;m really struggling with the assignment and I feel like I&rsquo;m grasping at straws right now. I don&rsquo;t know how to read a book in order to do a literary critique. He said not to panic but I am totally panicking. He gave me a lot of good starting points but I still don&rsquo;t know where to go from there. Curse my mostly logical mind.</p>

<p>The bus route I take home stops at another university. Some people got on and it turns out two friends of high school got on as well! It was a pleasant surprise because I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone from outside of university in a very long time. Talking to someone on the bus for once was really nice. Ideally, I would have wanted to work on this blog post but it turns out that worked in my favour since I have more to talk about!</p>

<p>On the second bus home, I slipped on the wet floor and landed on my butt/black. My butt is slightly sore now and I scraped my elbow. It was embarrassing. Hopefully no one saw other than the bus driver. I like to sit near the front and don&rsquo;t look behind me to see if there are other people still on the bus.</p>

<p>By the time I got home, it was already way past dinner time. I ate and then it was already 8:30pm. Then my computer refused to turn on. So I just planned out my week and did some homework that I could do on my iPod. So much for no digital dependence tho semester. I swear I&rsquo;ll do better next time!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m listening to Hitomi no Junnin by L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel and having major L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel feels. I will go to bed as soon as I post this. Hopefully my thing will be ~500 words. There&rsquo;s no word count in the WordPress app. ;A;</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Two posts in a row about Rooster Teeth. No regrets. I&rsquo;ve been hanging around the Rooster Teeth website<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-102" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-102">1</a></sup> and just browsing around.</p>

<p>Now, Rooster Teeth has this original animated series called RWBY. Long story short, it&rsquo;s about a group of exceptional warrior youths training to fight against creatures and terrorist groups. Cool, I know. One of the major strengths of the series is it&rsquo;s soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. The producer of the series has stated that music is a big inspiration for his work and it totally shows. They did not cheap out on the music! It really shone in the trailers, with the trailers being basically short music videos. Each main character (<strong>R</strong>uby, <strong>W</strong>eiss, <strong>B</strong>lake, and <strong>Y</strong>ang) had their own trailer, with the music for each being distinctive and revealing some hints about their personality. I personally love each and everyone and my &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; largely depends on my mood. I will say that Weiss&rsquo; trailer (set to the song &ldquo;Mirror, Mirror ft. Casey Lee&rdquo; by Jeff Williams) is my favourite a lot of the times.</p>

<p>Enough about the trailers! The soundtrack in the series itself<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-102" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-102">2</a></sup> is great as well. The opening theme is pretty top. It has great energy and wonderful riffs. Combined with the actual video&hellip; It&rsquo;s pretty cool to watch. I even feel proud of RT producing something as cool as that<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-102" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-102">3</a></sup>. That kinda says a lot, I think.</p>

<p>However, with the Extra Life event wrapping up, the main composer decided to treat us for our generosity. He released one of the RWBY songs early: <strong>Gold</strong>. I&rsquo;m honestly super in love with it! It has a funky disco vibe. Lately I&rsquo;ve been grooving to Bruno Mars&rsquo; &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; and have been craving for similar sounding songs. Gold is reminiscent of that sound. The bass has a very cool melody. The strings just add to the atmosphere. Don&rsquo;t event get me started with the upbeat piano bits. I like it all! One of my favourite things is when it diverges back to the very typical &ldquo;Jeff Williams sound,&rdquo; a very warm and almost folk-like twang of a guitar. It&rsquo;s just an A+ song.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m slowly slipping in terms of school. I just don&rsquo;t feel motivation anymore. I just want everything to end. I keep telling myself that I won&rsquo;t be hirable if I&rsquo;m being like this but it&rsquo;s hard. I think I&rsquo;m losing focus again and it&rsquo;s scary because I want to stick to my goal but I keep on second guessing that goal. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself. I don&rsquo;t know what will happen to me in the future. I keep feeling like there&rsquo;s going to be an inevitable mishap and that I shouldn&rsquo;t try to put any effort in anyway if things are going to turn the way I think they are. It&rsquo;s going to sound weird but I think &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; kind of triggered these feelings in me. It&rsquo;s a great song but listening to those lyrics carefully, I strangely feel horribly empty and lost. I feel tears welling up in me when I listen to Casey&rsquo;s beautiful voice promising her everlasting loyalty. It&rsquo;s beautiful but at the same time, I can&rsquo;t help but think, I don&rsquo;t even have a friendship that closely resembles that. I&rsquo;m just being really weird right now. I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I need someone more than ever but I don&rsquo;t even know who to go to.</p>

<p>_Don&rsquo;t you worry about the dark</p>

<p>I will light up the night</p>

<p>With the love in my heart</p>

<p>I will burn like the sun</p>

<p>I will keep you safe and warm</p>

<p>Like the smell of a rose on a summer day</p>

<p>I will be there to take all your fears away</p>

<p>With a touch of my hand</p>

<p>I will turn your life to gold_</p>

        <p>November is NaNoWriMo<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-24" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-24">1</a></sup>. I <strong>know</strong> I will never be able to participate in NaNoWriMo. So I&rsquo;m going to do BloWriMo: Blog Writing Month (which was technically last month, oops). Really lame, I know, but writing everyday is doable but at the same time, challenging. I&rsquo;m aiming for at least 500 words everyday. Yesterday I only did around 440 words but that&rsquo;s because I did not know that I was doing this. I just came up with this five minutes ago. Thankfully (according to Google) I am not alone in this.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m watching the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjrOuLhO170">Rooster Teeth Extra Life</a> stream. They are participating in a 25 hour event where they play games and raise money while doing it. They started 8:00am Austin, Texas time and by 5:00pm they reached $50,000 USD! I would donate myself but I don&rsquo;t have a credit card. It&rsquo;s pretty entertaining. Basically a really long podcast except they just play games while talking. They rotate out with Rooster Teeth<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-24" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-24">3</a></sup> staff and I just love listening to them talk. It&rsquo;s even greater when they bring in staff that don&rsquo;t appear on camera because they are just as awesome as the staff that are in videos all the time.</p>

<p>As well as playing games on the Extra Life stream, they gave away headsets, controllers, and other goodies. At the same time they also accepted donations from selling posters at $10 each (over 10,000 sold so far at 9:00pm). At some milestones, they did &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; things. In the first picture in this post, you can see Ray sporting his surperhero suit. Below, you can see Michael<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-24" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-24">4</a></sup> eating 12 lava cakes. Spoiler alert: he did it. I wanted to throw up but he threw up after so same thing? Also, they answered a lot of questions from Twitter. They even answered one of my questions<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_5-24" id="back_ajs-fn-id_5-24">5</a></sup>: What&rsquo;s the best way to get started in the RT community? The answer was actually very helpful, by the way. Caiti<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_6-24" id="back_ajs-fn-id_6-24">6</a></sup> recommended signing up for the RT site and setting up your feed so that you can get real-time updates from all the users on the site, AKA the &ldquo;Everyone&rdquo; tab on the homepage. That way you can comment on whatever interests you and hopefully make friends by interacting with other people&rsquo;s content. I did not know about this and it absolutely blew my mind. Have yet to make any friends on the RT site using this method, yet. My time will come&hellip; One day. My big problem is that I don&rsquo;t frequent the site enough to do so. I don&rsquo;t have much time lurk around the site and comment. I&rsquo;ll have to get over that sooner or later.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before but I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of Rooster Teeth. Until recently, I would watch all of the videos that they release, including the ones on their <a href="http://youtube.com/letsplay">Let&rsquo;s Play channel</a> but lately, I&rsquo;ve been more selective. So many videos, so little time! In the words of Lindsay Tuggey, &ldquo;I could never watch all of these [cats] in one lifetime.&rdquo; I just find the gals and guys at Rooster Teeth so lovable. It would be really cool to go to RTX one day but for now&hellip; Yeah, that&rsquo;s not happening.</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s all pictures from here on out. I got tired of screen-capping at around 12:00pm Austin time. Also, @RyanTheTwit 2013 never forget. &lt;3</p>

        <p>There&rsquo;s nothing like starting a new website on the first day of a month, halfway through the semester, and with my very first responsive design.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited that I&rsquo;m (silently) opening this website but I also have this nagging feeling at the back of my mind. I need to close a few other chapters in my online life. I have two domains that I will be letting go. One is my current blog and the other was a failed project blog of mine. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m a huge domain junkie. I&rsquo;ve spent an embarrassing amount of money on domains. People have their shoes or their Filofaxes<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-14" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-14">1</a></sup> and I have my domains.</p>

<p>Actually, I was just watching an old episode of the Rooster Teeth<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-14" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-14">2</a></sup> podcast and Gus Sorola was saying how it was too easy for people to get a domain name and that they should restrict it more. I understand why he&rsquo;s saying that and I even agree a little but at the same time, I&rsquo;m one of those people he&rsquo;s talking about. You know, the ones that buy a domain but never really end up doing anything with it. I always intend to but somehow that always fall through the cracks. With this blog starting on the 1st of November, I feel like I should blog everyday now. Weird how that works.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started taking the bus to school instead of the train and because of that, posting everyday just might be possible. My commute is now an hour and a half<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-14" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-14">3</a></sup>, which leaves me plenty of time to muse on my day in the form of blogging. The downside is that I feel way more tired on a bus than I do on a train. I almost always fall asleep when I take the bus home. As a classmate of mine would say, #TheStruggle.</p>

<p>Ever since Tumblr came into my life, I feel the need to ironically use hash tags. Does that make me a hipster? #YOLO. #SWAG. #LOL. No really, I literally find myself in situations where I almost blurt &ldquo;hash tag YOLO.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t fit my personality at all either. Tumblr has also conditioned me to react in gifs or curse words in my mind. I&rsquo;m not a fan of this. Thankfully, I quit Tumblr for now but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I still have these tendencies.</p>

<p>Anyway, my sleeping schedule has not been working out this past week. I want to start sleeping before midnight and it&rsquo;s already half past <em>and</em> I plan on waking up early. I need sleep&hellip; Maybe that way I won&rsquo;t fall asleep on the bus when I should be writing blog posts.</p>

        <p>I am almost done my first month of my second year at university! It&rsquo;s been an interesting year leading up to now. I got into university, turned 18, hated engineering with a passion, sucked at engineering with a passion, went to the Philippines, switched majors (in a transition major right now until I can switch into computer science please don&rsquo;t ask me what it is), got a job as a cashier at Walmart over the summer (don&rsquo;t ask me about that either please), got my courses for this semester dropped, went to fix my schedule, found out it wasn&rsquo;t actually fixed and didn&rsquo;t find out until a few days into the first week, and went to go fix it yet again. So yeah, a quick summary of the last year.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m trying my best to keep ahead in my classes. I&rsquo;m only taking three right now; which is just barely enough to be called a full time student. For this semester I am taking an introductory course to Python, a Russian literature course, and a repeat of a math course that I passed but need a higher grade in to fulfill future prerequisites. My class schedule is pretty light so that&rsquo;s a big relief.</p>

<p><a href="/im-bad-for-the-environment-">Last post</a> I said that I&rsquo;m trying to go mostly paperless. It&rsquo;s going well so far. It sucks that my computer science course requires a computer (which is crazy, I know) and that my math course has online assignments, but hopefully that won&rsquo;t be a problem. I decided against buying a pretty (and pretty expensive) <a href="http://filofaxusa.com">Filofax</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using my page per day (PPD, as I&rsquo;ll refer to it as in the future) planner and I found that I have a lot to do each day. Unless I want to lug around a huge binder planner with me, there&rsquo;s no way I can fit all of it into a smaller sized Filofax. My At-A-Glance DayMinder is working well so far, and I love it. Plus, I can&rsquo;t get over the fact that it&rsquo;s such a lovely shade of orange.</p>

<div class="aligncenter">
  <div class="picture">
    <img src="http://e.bubblepopstar.net/blog/images/planner.png" alt="my planner" /><br />My "busiest" day to date.
  </div>
</div>

<p>I really love colour coding in my planner. Each course is a different colour not only in my planner but in my notes. I bought some <a href="http://zebrapen.com/products/pen/sarasa-se?c=28">Sarasa SE pens</a> at my campus bookstore. I really like the ink quality and how it looks on the page. I also love how it writes. It&rsquo;s not scratchy but oh so smooth. However, it&rsquo;s only been a month and the ink is running out fast! It could be because it&rsquo;s a gel pen and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s pretty much draining onto the page.They&rsquo;re expensive pens too, so I was hoping I would be using them for longer. Maybe I just write too much! Mental note to find nice coloured pens that don&rsquo;t run out so fast. Fat chance of that, but a girl can dream, right?</p>

<div class="aligncenter">
  <div class="picture">
    <img src="http://e.bubblepopstar.net/blog/images/pens.png" alt="pens" /><br />Not sure if you can see the ink levels but compare the green to the purple. This was taken after the first week of school.

<p>While I was going through my endless RSS feed of subscribed blogs (I haven&rsquo;t been keeping up lately, and have a ton of backlog oops), I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.paperlovestory.com/2013/08/preparing-for-university-creating.html">a post from Paper Lovestory</a> showing off Angela&rsquo;s weekly timetable. That post was made exactly a month ago so you can tell where I am in my blog backlog, haha. Angela has a whole lot of cool orangization ideas. I always drool over her expensive accessories (like her Filofaxes). It kinda makes me jealous but at the same time I feel good about the money I save, haha. Plus, the printables she makes can be easily adapted for non-Filofax use, which is great for me! Anyway, the timetable is so simple but it&rsquo;s so good. I took the initiative to do my own. Somewhat colour coded, of course.</p>

<div class="aligncenter">
  <div class="picture">
    <img src="http://e.bubblepopstar.net/blog/images/weekly-schedule.png" alt="pens" /><br />I really want to redo this because I totally think I screwed something up.

<p>Disclaimer: I realize I just linked dump and name dropped a lot of companies and blogs so I would just like to say that I compensated in mentioned these and any opinion written here is entirely my own.</p>
