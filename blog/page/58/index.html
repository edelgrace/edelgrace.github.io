<p>I have a new phone. It&rsquo;s a shiny smartphone, a Samsung Galaxy Ace II, I believe. It&rsquo;s pretty nice and does fancy things but it&rsquo;s hard to get used to as an avid iPod touch user. I have to say though, pretty much all of the Androids apps are way better and prettier than the iOS versions. Especially the WordPress app!</p>

<p>Exams. Ugh. So far they aren&rsquo;t doing so well. My productivity is at an all time low. Like no really, I have never been this unproductive ever. It&rsquo;s kind of scary, I&rsquo;m losing motivation and some of the things I used to like to do just aren&rsquo;t as fun anymore. I&rsquo;ll get through it though, I always do!</p>

        <p>I let Pure-Orenji.info go because of money issues. This is not the case here. I don&rsquo;t think anyone (except for maybe one or two people) followed Pure Orenji back when it was a blog. During that time I was going through a weird relationship thing. Also around that time I bought Brokenphrases.info. The name &ldquo;Brokenphrases&rdquo; was highly inspired by my (lack of) social skills and as much as I don&rsquo;t like to admit it, a poem written by the other person in said relationship.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost three years since I&rsquo;ve spoken to that person and we left on bitter terms. I should have gotten rid of Brokenphrases right there but I didn&rsquo;t because I was still clinging onto my feelings for that person. Even though it&rsquo;s been such a long time ago and I don&rsquo;t feel any bitterness anymore (more like awkwardness), I sometimes feel weird having Brokenphrases as a domain. It&rsquo;s pretty much like regularly wearing a shirt that someone you once hated gave you. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still on the fence about it. If I were to let this site go, I&rsquo;d buy another domain name or merge it with another one of my websites. Any thoughts?</p>

              <li><a href="/categories/life">Life</a></li>            
              
  
              
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve decided that <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/">Room 304</a> is now officially a book log/archive with minimal blog posts. This calls for a redesign that will emphasize the fact. Why the change? It was always my intention to have Room 304 solely as a book log. But as I heard about book blogging, I decided I would give it a chance. It overshadowed the logging aspect of the site, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like I wanted to update the site anymore. So yes, a &ldquo;new&rdquo; focus for Room 304!</p>

<p>That being said, the blogging part is <strong>not</strong> going away. However, it definitely will not be frequent. I&rsquo;ll just be posting the books I&rsquo;ve bought and/or borrowed from the library. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll do stuff like Follow Fridays (minus the following) and other memes like that but those will be even rarer. So yes. My library haul for the month!</p>

<p>I actually took these books out on the 9th. I&rsquo;ve neglected to post about it but better late than never! I&rsquo;m actually returning a few of them today. In fact, I&rsquo;ve finished reading all of the books except one. Mind you, 80% of the books are manga and/or are &ldquo;easy&rdquo; reads.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the list!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother: Stories of Loss and Love by Xinran</strong><br />
While I was doing my daily browsing of all the aisles in the library, I came across this little gem! I wanted to take it out before, but I felt like I had too many books on my plate. So I came back and got it now!</li>
<li><strong>Alcestis by Katharine Beutner</strong><br />
This caught my eye right away because I really love Greek myths. Especially anything to do with the Underworld. Hades you beast. And poor, sweet, dear, precious <del>fefeta</del> Persephone.</li>
<li><strong>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Forsaken by Oliver Bowden</strong><br />
As soon as I realized that the library actually had Assassin&rsquo;s Creed books, I had to grab them! I&rsquo;ve heard about this book among the fandom and a lot of people love it. Mostly because Haytham is in it? Seeing as how it&rsquo;s a journal of pretty much his entire life, I was intrigued. I also can&rsquo;t bear to miss any piece of canon media.</li>
<li><strong>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Renaissance by Oliver Bowden</strong><br />
Saw this one right next to Forsaken. No regrets.</li>
<li><strong>Kimi Ni Todoke (Volumes 1-7) by Karuho Shiina</strong><br />
This series has been on my to-read list for the looongest time. It&rsquo;s almost been over three years, actually! I&rsquo;ve put it off because it&rsquo;s licensed in English (I know, I&rsquo;m horrible). As soon as I saw several volumes starting from the very beginning, I grabbed them all.</li>
<li><strong>Cirque du Freak (Volumes 8-12) by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai</strong><br />
Okay, I&rsquo;ve been reading this series for around two years. These are the final volumes. I just have to finish what I started!</li>
<li><strong>The Limit (Volumes 1 &amp; 2) by Keiko Suenobu</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m a big fan of Keiko Suenobu. I&rsquo;ve read most of her series, <em>Life</em> and a couple of her works. I&rsquo;ve always had a soft spot for over dramatic high school kids. On a more serious note, Suenobu loves to focus on bullying and I just love the awareness she&rsquo;s trying to spread. She&rsquo;s always a good read!</li>
</ul>

        <p>I went to the library last Saturday! Quite fitting because it is reading week at university. I&rsquo;m probably the only one who takes the &ldquo;reading&rdquo; in reading week seriously&hellip; Anyway, here is my library haul this week in order of the books I remember first:</p>

<ul>
<li>French Milk by Lucy Knisley<br />
I&rsquo;m always a sucker for personal memoir-like graphic novels. The cover is just too charming to not want to read it!</li>
<li>Negima! (Volume 1) by Ken Akamatsu<br />
The name sounded familiar so I though, why not? I picked it up. Turns out Akamatsu is the mangaka for <em>Love Hina</em>. I predict boobs.</li>
<li>Pure by Timothy Mo<br />
Not going to lie, the cover is what did it for me. So pure.</li>
<li>I Shall Not Hate by Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish&rsquo;s<br />
Apparently this has been on my to read list for a while. I don&rsquo;t know how or why but it&rsquo;s been on there! So I finally decided to get it.</li>
<li>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle<br />
I&rsquo;ve been looking for a book I once read in elementary. This is a possible candidate for said book.</li>
<li>The Selector of Souls by Shauna Singh Baldwin<br />
My library was doing a blind date with a book thing. I thought it would be about tapestries. It&rsquo;s actually about India. Close enough.</li>
<li>Daughter of Xanadu by Dori Jones Yang<br />
Another one that&rsquo;s been on my to read list for a while.</li>
</ul>

<p>Books that I still need to add to the log:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moon Boy (Volume 4)</li>
<li>Moon Boy (Volume 5)</li>
<li>Josephine: A Life of the Empress</li>
<li>The Case for God</li>
<li>A whole load more of books&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently got back into reading online web comics&hellip; That was definitely not a good idea&hellip;</p>

<p>I quit Tumblr for Lent. It&rsquo;s only been a couple of days, and I&rsquo;ve accumulated so many Tumblr blog posts in my mind and it&rsquo;s kinda driving me crazy. So crazy to the point where a Tumblr and serious blog crossover is inevitable. Tumblr posts are mostly Twitter-like in nature, except ten times the sarcasm, ten times the ironic usage of poor grammar and spelling, and ten times that length. Not to mention the heavily fangirling where everyone assumes that everyone else knows what they&rsquo;re talking about, even if they&rsquo;re not in the fandom (I tried so hard to make this sentence make sense but this is all I got).</p>

<h4 id="ugh-no-wow-stop">Ugh no wow stop</h4>

<p>Attractive engineering guy is really attractive. I haven&rsquo;t seen him since like semester. Now I go to a different lecture for my statics course because my statics prof confuses me. I found out that attractive engineering guy was in the lecture and we&rsquo;ve been sitting together lately. It&rsquo;s nice. I love watching his mouth when he talks. One side of his mouth goes crooked. Really cute. Although he tends to mumble/speak really softly. Combined with the accent I&rsquo;m constantly saying &ldquo;Pardon? Oh goodness, sorry, I didn&rsquo;t hear that&hellip; What? Say that again? &hellip; Pardon?&rdquo; I also noticed that his hair seems to look lighter. I thought it was jet black (or really close to black) but now it looks like a warm and dark chestnut. I also feel stupid now, he got a B+ in the subject I did the worst in and said he wasn&rsquo;t smart. Brb crying in a corner now.</p>

<h4 id="jake-why">JAKE WHY</h4>

<p>Today the family and I were eating a nice, quiet dinner and then Homestuck got updated. I know this because my dad suddenly said, &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; It was the sound of my laptop blasting Cascade, the song my update checking software plays every time there&rsquo;s a new Homestuck update. I wanted to go turn it off but my mom was all, &ldquo;No! Stay at the dinner table, no one&rsquo;s supposed to leave until we&rsquo;re all done eating!&rdquo; So we spent the rest of the dinner awkwardly talking over Cascade while I was drowning in tons of Cascade related feels.</p>

<h4 id="holy-crap-that-upd8">HOLY CRAP, THAT UPD8</h4>

<p>KARKAT IS BACK. HOLY ADKHFJKLASDHFKLAJSHF. YES. BBY I MISS YOU. I MISS ALL THE TROLLS. VRISKA WHERE ARE YOUUUU.</p>

<p>WAIT IS HE TALKING INTO A LOBSTER.</p>

<p>(Note: This is a typical Tumblr post for me. Yeah. Tumblr culture is significantly different than the sophisticated blogosphere).</p>

<h4 id="i-m-srsly-so-stupid">I&rsquo;m srsly so stupid</h4>

<p>My chem lab partner is kinda cute, hahahahahaha</p>

<p>*flied out the window*</p>

<p>But I seriously ruined our lab experiment and I just. WHY??</p>

<h4 id="i-take-reading-week-seriously">I take reading week seriously</h4>

<p>I went to the library today and got some awesome possum books. I was delighted to see that my local library had the &ldquo;blind date with a book&rdquo; booth set up. So I picked one up. It was labelled as &ldquo;a wonderfully woven tapestry&rdquo; or something like that. At first I was like, OH GOD A BOOK ABOUT TAPESTRIES HOW HARD CORE IS THAT THIS BOOK SPEAKS TO ME. But it&rsquo;s actually a book about India. That&rsquo;s cool too, but I was disappointed. One day I&rsquo;m going to write a book about five little old ladies in a tapestry weaving club. Now <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> hard core. (I&rsquo;m not even joking I&rsquo;ve got the whole thing planned out).</p>

<h4 id="always-there">Always there</h4>

<p>To the man and his son who I never fail to see every Saturday sitting in front of the religious books whenever I go to Fish Creek,</p>

<p>I assume the worst. The public library is public after all. The first two times I saw you two sitting there, I thought nothing of it. But both times neither of you were looking at the books. This time you were just holding your son, both of you in your own world. I don&rsquo;t know your story. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re always here. But I hope that whatever happens in your life, it will only be good things.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-you-from">Where are you from?</h4>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> Where are you from?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Canada</p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> No like, where are you from?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Canada???</p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> NO. WHERE. ARE. YOU. FROM?</p>

<p>I got this question asked to me yesterday. Twice. I decided to not be sassy and just said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Filipino. I was born here.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s funny whenever people ask me that question. Kinda like how they assume everyone&rsquo;s an immigrant (which is technically true if you go far back enough and if you&rsquo;re not First Nations).</p>

<h4 id="those-midterms-gfdi">Those midterms gfdi</h4>

<p>I had two midterms today. Pretty sure I failed both of them. I&rsquo;m 100% sure I&rsquo;ll do better on the remaining midterms though because I actually know what&rsquo;s going on in those courses.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird how that after I write I write a hard test, I am filled with self loathing. Not just the &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;m so stupid why do I procrastinate I hate myself&rdquo; self loathing you&rsquo;d expect after an academic failure but the &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;m a horrible person like that one time I said a bad thing about that one person x years ago&rdquo; kind of self loathing. I don&rsquo;t understand how that works.</p>

<h4 id="can-t-wait-for-summer">Can&rsquo;t wait for summer!</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s official. We&rsquo;re going to the Philippines for the month of May! My mom just picked up the plane tickets a couple of days ago. I&rsquo;m super excited. I can&rsquo;t wait. I just need to get through this gosh darn awful semester first. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll happen&hellip;</p>
