        <p>I said before that I&rsquo;m finding it slightly hard to come up with blog topics. Therefore, I am creating a new feature for my blog: Just a Review. It&rsquo;s basically what it seems like: just a review of my day. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a <em>review</em> review but more like a summary. If I rated my days it would be very depressing to look at all the low scores<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-120" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-120">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So, from the beginning!</p>

<p>This morning I woke up. I have alarms on my iPod that go off at five minute intervals. I totally thought I had an alarm for 7:05 but when I finally came to, it was 7:13. It doesn&rsquo;t seem that disastrous at first but it is when I have to leave the house at 7:45! To my dismay I realized that my breakfast was to be porridge. It takes me forever to eat porridge! Although, I&rsquo;m proud to say that I downed that mofo in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>When I got to the station, I didn&rsquo;t get a seat on the bus like I usually do. Not getting a seat on the train isn&rsquo;t a big deal but it is on the bus. The train doesn&rsquo;t make huge turns that doesn&rsquo;t threaten to throw you on the person next to you. As soon as a good chunk of people got off the bus, I grabbed a seat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s getting late and unfortunately I have no time to write the restful this blog post!</p>

        <p>Moments like these, I question my desire to go to graduate school. I have a paper to write by Friday. I was told to basically start over and I&rsquo;m stuck. It&rsquo;s on a novel and we&rsquo;re supposed to pull out symbols for it and I&rsquo;m just drawing a blank. My prof started connecting some of them and I tried to follow suit but they&rsquo;re too far fetched. I&rsquo;m really frustrated and I don&rsquo;t know what to do! The thought of this paper is really freaking me out because I want to do good but I&rsquo;m not sure if I can. This is one thing I don&rsquo;t miss about high school: essays. I know computer science doesn&rsquo;t lack essays by any means but that&rsquo;s not the focus. Ugh, I just cannot write for the life of me!</p>

<p>When I was younger, I even wanted to be an author. I wanted to write and illustrate my own books. However, I could never finish anything I started. Also, I quickly began to realize that I do not have the talent to be an author. A lot of people say that writing a skill but a <em>great</em> author has talent that can never replace skill. You just can&rsquo;t learn how to bend and twist words into a sentence that takes people&rsquo;s breath away. You can try to copy but it just won&rsquo;t create the same effect. Some people just know how language works.</p>

<p>Another thing that great author&rsquo;s have is knowledge. They understand humanity and know how to tap into our very essence. They see the inner workings of our heart down to the very last blood vessel. Not only do they know the individual well, they also know society. They can critique it and suggest clever ways to remedy even the smallest of society&rsquo;s flaws. Don&rsquo;t even get me started about how well great authors do relationships. They know. They know everything about it.</p>

<p>I wish I was one of those people. I&rsquo;ve met people (okay, one person) who match my description perfectly. I&rsquo;ve given up on writing a long time ago but I didn&rsquo;t really start in the first place. This person has such a beautiful way with words that my jealousy is minuscule in comparison of the awe I feel when I&rsquo;m in this person&rsquo;s presence. It&rsquo;s like knowing that you are standing at the foot of a genius. Is this what people thought when they were in the presence of both Mayakovsky and Bulgakov at the same time?</p>

<p>Back to my original point, I really do think that someone either has it, or they don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re either born with it or were instilled with it at a very young age. Unfortunately, neither happened to me. At my age, it&rsquo;s too late to understand how to create masterpieces. A small part of me is hopeful, though. I wish writing was a skill that I could hone and one day, I&rsquo;ll know everything that makes a human, human.</p>

<p>On another note, I keep forgetting to do these blog posts until the very last minute. As I&rsquo;m writing this, it&rsquo;s nearly 11:30. I started writing at around 10:50. I think I mentioned this yesterday but it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to think of new content to write about. Most of the things I want to write include pictures. Pictures are too time consuming and don&rsquo;t fit into my schedule right now. I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;m hitting my 500 daily word count goal because the app does not keep track of it. It would be cool if the WordPress app did more with it. I&rsquo;d like to see a focus on the admin. I love the posting features but I&rsquo;d like to see more editing themes, adding plugins, changing settings, etc.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/loving-larcenciel/">Loving L’Arc~en~Ciel</a></h3>
        <h4>Nov 6, 2013 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/loving-larcenciel/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
        
        <div class="tags">
            <ul>
              
              <li><a href="/categories/music">Music</a></li>            
              
  
              
              <li><a href="/tags/larc~en~ciel">#l&#39;arc~en~ciel</a></li>
              
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>It&rsquo;s no secret to many people that L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is my favourite band. No, not one of my favourite bands, but my <strong><em>favourite</em></strong> band. Previously, my favourite band had been Green Day, from about grade four to junior high school. They were a great band for me at the time but they didn&rsquo;t have a timeless feel to them. After listening to L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel, I quickly dumped them.</p>

<p>When I was in junior high I even wrote an essay about how L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel had impacted my life. My teacher loved it and even read it out loud for the class. Thank gosh that was an elective class that comprised mostly of friends or acquaintances. I so wish I still had that essay!</p>

<p>Basically, my journey with L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel started, like for many people, with the anime Full Metal Alchemist. <em>Ready, Steady, Go!</em> was one of the opening theme songs to Full Metal Alchemist. I didn&rsquo;t like it as much, to be honest. The vocalist<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-111">1</a></sup> had a really low voice that I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of.</p>

<p>Then I watched Full Metal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shambala. I thought it was a great movie. The opening for the movie was <em>Link</em> and the ending was <em>Lost Heaven</em>. I loved those two songs so much after listening to them just once that I went ahead and downloaded most of L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel&rsquo;s discography. I fell in love with them and loved everything they did.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone in and out of being obsessed with L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel. These days I definitely do not listen to them as much as I used to but I still listen to them a lot. Every time I listen to one of their songs, I just feel this weird calm come over me and I feel immersed in the music. It&rsquo;s almost like I&rsquo;m falling in love with them all over again each time. Their songs just never seem to get old<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-111">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel songs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Forbidden Lover</strong><br />
By far my favourite song, ever. It just has a haunted and powerful sound. Utterly tragic and beautiful. Every member shines, even if I can&rsquo;t hear the bassist<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-111">3</a></sup> 90% of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Link</strong><br />
That song I talked about earlier? An oldie but a goodie. I used to get choked up listening to this song. Now? Not so much. Granted, I do feel a bit emotional when I listen to it. I think it&rsquo;s the nostalgia factor.</li>
<li><strong>Time Goes On</strong><br />
One of the really singable songs. I think this song just represents a really great era for the band. It&rsquo;s not hard core but not mellow either. I think Hyde&rsquo;s vocals really stand out in this one.</li>
<li><strong>All Dead</strong><br />
This song is older than I am<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-111">4</a></sup> but I find it to be a classic. In the band&rsquo;s beginning, their sound was <em>very</em> Spanish rock. I just fell in love with the guitar in this song. It gets in my head and it does this weird thing to my emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Niji</strong><br />
This is a classic song. Apparently most of their concerts end with this song and I can see why. It sounds like a plea or a very heartbroken goodbye. The vocals are very powerful and almost on the brink of screaming while still sounding beautiful. The song just jumps right in and you&rsquo;re immediately hit with these emotions.</li>
<li><strong>4th Avenue Cafe</strong><br />
One of those carefree songs that I really like! I alway want to jump or dance or just sing along whenever I listen to this. It just makes me so <em>happy</em>. At the same time, it also makes me emotional! It&rsquo;s just another one of those trademark L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel songs that you listen to and you just feel like, &ldquo;Without this song, L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel would not be L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel.&rdquo;</li>

        <h4>Nov 5, 2013 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/seriously-cant-get-over-gold/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

              <li><a href="/categories/internet">Internet</a></li>

        </div>

        <p>I have been listening to &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; by Jeff &amp; Casey Lee Williams nonstop all day. I just love it. It makes me want to dance around and sing. It also makes me feel very warm and fuzzy inside. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve listened to a song that makes me that gushy. I just can&rsquo;t get over the funky discos vibe. Those guitar licks and the strings and Casey&rsquo;s voice&hellip; It&rsquo;s seriously too much to love!</p>

<p>On another note, man, I&rsquo;m already finding that writing a blog post everyday is hard. I don&rsquo;t have any topics! I guess I could do a reflection each day and record what happened explicitly. I&rsquo;ve always loved reading diaries that recounted events. In fact, that&rsquo;s mostly what I&rsquo;ve been defining a blog as: recounting my days.</p>

<p>This morning, I had to write a midterm in my Russian course. It was really brutal, I think. I wish I had studied a little bit more. I think I did okay but definitely not as good as I wanted. Fingers crossed that I passed!</p>

<p>For the next three hours (I have a three hour break between lectures) I worked on my thesis and outline on my Heart of a Dog paper. It was a painful three hours.</p>

<p>Then I had computer science lecture. I found myself falling asleep almost. I need more sleep. We learned more about GUIs and my mind just shut down. My TA walked over and told us that we didn&rsquo;t do so well on our last exercise. News I didn&rsquo;t want to hear. In the words of my fellow group member, &ldquo;We have to step up our game for next time!&rdquo; Ughh.</p>

<p>Bad news after bad news. I went to my ADS to go over my outline for a paper and I just complete missed the mark on everything. I&rsquo;m really struggling with the assignment and I feel like I&rsquo;m grasping at straws right now. I don&rsquo;t know how to read a book in order to do a literary critique. He said not to panic but I am totally panicking. He gave me a lot of good starting points but I still don&rsquo;t know where to go from there. Curse my mostly logical mind.</p>

<p>The bus route I take home stops at another university. Some people got on and it turns out two friends of high school got on as well! It was a pleasant surprise because I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone from outside of university in a very long time. Talking to someone on the bus for once was really nice. Ideally, I would have wanted to work on this blog post but it turns out that worked in my favour since I have more to talk about!</p>

<p>On the second bus home, I slipped on the wet floor and landed on my butt/black. My butt is slightly sore now and I scraped my elbow. It was embarrassing. Hopefully no one saw other than the bus driver. I like to sit near the front and don&rsquo;t look behind me to see if there are other people still on the bus.</p>

<p>By the time I got home, it was already way past dinner time. I ate and then it was already 8:30pm. Then my computer refused to turn on. So I just planned out my week and did some homework that I could do on my iPod. So much for no digital dependence tho semester. I swear I&rsquo;ll do better next time!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m listening to Hitomi no Junnin by L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel and having major L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel feels. I will go to bed as soon as I post this. Hopefully my thing will be ~500 words. There&rsquo;s no word count in the WordPress app. ;A;</p>

        <p>Two posts in a row about Rooster Teeth. No regrets. I&rsquo;ve been hanging around the Rooster Teeth website<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-102" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-102">1</a></sup> and just browsing around.</p>

<p>Now, Rooster Teeth has this original animated series called RWBY. Long story short, it&rsquo;s about a group of exceptional warrior youths training to fight against creatures and terrorist groups. Cool, I know. One of the major strengths of the series is it&rsquo;s soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. The producer of the series has stated that music is a big inspiration for his work and it totally shows. They did not cheap out on the music! It really shone in the trailers, with the trailers being basically short music videos. Each main character (<strong>R</strong>uby, <strong>W</strong>eiss, <strong>B</strong>lake, and <strong>Y</strong>ang) had their own trailer, with the music for each being distinctive and revealing some hints about their personality. I personally love each and everyone and my &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; largely depends on my mood. I will say that Weiss&rsquo; trailer (set to the song &ldquo;Mirror, Mirror ft. Casey Lee&rdquo; by Jeff Williams) is my favourite a lot of the times.</p>

<p>Enough about the trailers! The soundtrack in the series itself<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-102" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-102">2</a></sup> is great as well. The opening theme is pretty top. It has great energy and wonderful riffs. Combined with the actual video&hellip; It&rsquo;s pretty cool to watch. I even feel proud of RT producing something as cool as that<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-102" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-102">3</a></sup>. That kinda says a lot, I think.</p>

<p>However, with the Extra Life event wrapping up, the main composer decided to treat us for our generosity. He released one of the RWBY songs early: <strong>Gold</strong>. I&rsquo;m honestly super in love with it! It has a funky disco vibe. Lately I&rsquo;ve been grooving to Bruno Mars&rsquo; &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; and have been craving for similar sounding songs. Gold is reminiscent of that sound. The bass has a very cool melody. The strings just add to the atmosphere. Don&rsquo;t event get me started with the upbeat piano bits. I like it all! One of my favourite things is when it diverges back to the very typical &ldquo;Jeff Williams sound,&rdquo; a very warm and almost folk-like twang of a guitar. It&rsquo;s just an A+ song.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m slowly slipping in terms of school. I just don&rsquo;t feel motivation anymore. I just want everything to end. I keep telling myself that I won&rsquo;t be hirable if I&rsquo;m being like this but it&rsquo;s hard. I think I&rsquo;m losing focus again and it&rsquo;s scary because I want to stick to my goal but I keep on second guessing that goal. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself. I don&rsquo;t know what will happen to me in the future. I keep feeling like there&rsquo;s going to be an inevitable mishap and that I shouldn&rsquo;t try to put any effort in anyway if things are going to turn the way I think they are. It&rsquo;s going to sound weird but I think &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; kind of triggered these feelings in me. It&rsquo;s a great song but listening to those lyrics carefully, I strangely feel horribly empty and lost. I feel tears welling up in me when I listen to Casey&rsquo;s beautiful voice promising her everlasting loyalty. It&rsquo;s beautiful but at the same time, I can&rsquo;t help but think, I don&rsquo;t even have a friendship that closely resembles that. I&rsquo;m just being really weird right now. I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I need someone more than ever but I don&rsquo;t even know who to go to.</p>

<p>_Don&rsquo;t you worry about the dark</p>

<p>I will light up the night</p>

<p>With the love in my heart</p>

<p>I will burn like the sun</p>

<p>I will keep you safe and warm</p>

<p>Like the smell of a rose on a summer day</p>

<p>I will be there to take all your fears away</p>

<p>With a touch of my hand</p>

<p>I will turn your life to gold_</p>
