        <p>So I started this post with me sitting in my office with Wheat Thins in hand, waiting for the Microsoft Press Conference to start via Twitch. The sound was clear, virtually no lag (unless I decided to open a gazillion tabs), and pretty good quality for just 360p. I never realized how huge E3 is. The venue for the Microsoft Press Conference is flipping huge. Seeing the crowd and the green glow absolutely sets the atmosphere. I can sense the anticipation in the room and golly am I excited! This is mostly a live blog and doesn&rsquo;t really offer any insights or anything, just things that jumped out at me. Also, I am game illiterate so my knowledge is basically null.</p>

<p>While watching this, typing this up, and making some tweets, I was also reading Rooster Teeth&rsquo;s live blog of the event. It&rsquo;s pretty hilarious, in a way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m liking that I&rsquo;m seeing gameplay. Not going to lie, MGS 5 looks like a cool game, even though I&rsquo;m not fond for these type of games.</p>

<p>A big shocker to me was the fact that they&rsquo;re releasing a new version of the Xbox 360. I find that&hellip; Weird. Especially a couple of months before the Xbox One coming out. I guess it&rsquo;s another way to rake in money.</p>

<p>Max and the Curse of Brotherhood is very cute platformer, seemingly tailored to younger gamers. Good to see that, there lacks good children games nowadays. Gotta grab them while they&rsquo;re young!</p>

<p>Now, Ryse: Son of Rome. A new franchise. A historical game, obviously taking place during the Roman times. Mostly a cinematic trailer, not sure if I&rsquo;m entirely sold yet. Scratch that, a live demo. You wouldn&rsquo;t even realize it IS gameplay, until the HUD comes on. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s very next gen. Just might get it. Hopefully it&rsquo;s not an Xbox One exclusive. I really like how if you want to step on someone, the button prompt is over the character&rsquo;s foot. That&rsquo;s a really cool detail. It looks awesome. And&hellip; It&rsquo;s exclusive to Xbox One.</p>

<p>Okay I don&rsquo;t like cars, but I like this car. Holy crap that McLaren P1 is so freaking sleek and sexy. I want that car.</p>

<p>The premise of this Quantam Break is almost deal breaking. I like this. Technology that can stop or stutter time? I love games like these. Too bad I think it&rsquo;s another exclusive game for the Xbox One.</p>

<p>And time went by really fast, I kinda glazed my eyes over the rest of the briefing, mostly because they were shooting games and I don&rsquo;t really find shooting games all that fun unless the story is ground breaking. I&rsquo;m picky about my character development. And I love conspiracy theories.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        

<p>While I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a huge gamer, I game enough to be excited about E3 that&rsquo;s starting tomorrow. There is a ton of stuff that are coming out that will hopefully be super crazy due to the next gen consoles that are coming this year. So, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eyes glued to the screen on over the next few days.</p>

<h3 id="ps4-console">PS4 Console</h3>

<p>They showed us the controller, they showed us the features, and they showed us the games. They haven&rsquo;t showed us the actual console. Contrary to the Xbox One reveal, the reveal for the PS4 was basically advertising for games. While I do think that not showing the console may give them some leverage over Microsoft in that they might be able to make some last minute tweaks, it&rsquo;s probably not significant if they showed it before or after the Xbox One. Still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I&rsquo;m super excited to see it!</p>

<h3 id="used-game-rental-and-trading-policies">Used Game, Rental, and Trading Policies</h3>

<p>Used games are awesome. When my cousin gives me games he thought he&rsquo;d like but didn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s even better. Mostly because overpriced games hurt my wallet. And because my family is always super late to an next gen consoles. For example, we bought a PS3 <strong>just last year</strong>. It&rsquo;ll be a couple of years until we get the PS4 and I&rsquo;m hoping a lot of used games will be available for us (the cheaper they are, the better).</p>

<h3 id="watch-dogs">WATCH_DOGS</h3>

<p>I hate to say that I love Ubisoft, but I love Ubisoft. Despite their endless pitfalls, they make games that I like. Watching the WATCH_DOGS segment at the PS4 reveal was mind blowing. I was hooked at the very second it started. I&rsquo;m a sucker for conspiracy theories, especial the &ldquo;one company that controls about 90% of the world but no one really knows it&rdquo; kind of conspiracies. The game itself looks awesome. It&rsquo;s reminiscent of Assassin&rsquo;s Creed and my fingers are crossed that maybe it might take place on the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed universe (which is not likely, since I&rsquo;m pretty sure UbiGabe shot that idea down).</p>

<h3 id="destiny">Destiny</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never gotten into Halo and probably never will but with this new IP, I might finally get a taste of the next and possibly biggest series to date. But before that happens, I need to see what it&rsquo;s all about and if it&rsquo;ll be a series at all.</p>

<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>

<p>Cinematic trailers and speeches are all fine and dandy but gameplay is where it&rsquo;s at. Gameplay is the deal breaker. It comes before everything else. I personally haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of gameplay from any of the upcoming games so I look forward to it!</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been in the Philippines for about five days now. We decided to take a family trip, because it&rsquo;s been way too long since we&rsquo;ve been here. It&rsquo;s been good for the most part. Except it&rsquo;s been an endless cycle of sleep, eat, sleep, eat, sleep with the rare outing. I thought I was going to lose weight here but I&rsquo;m actually gaining, haha.</p>

<p>So if you want to see my Tumblr-ized version of the first two days of my trip (because I&rsquo;m lazy and the heat makes me even lazier), here you go:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Holy shoes I have Internet. And I’m justifying my use of it because my brother is watching my cousin play CoD on the computer (boys are boys in any part of the world) and I have nothing else to do. ;_;</p>

<p>Yesterday I arrived in the Philippines. As soon as we stepped out of the plane, a wave of heat struck us. And I have to say, Noynoy International Airport is super friendly. You know that little link from the plane to the actual airport? There was staff literally lining the walls greeting us. “Welcome to the Philippines. Mabuhay. Welcome.” Pretty darn cool. While we were waiting for our baggage a swarm of people came to help us. They all want to get tipped, haha. But we ran out of pesos tipping just one person and my dad gave five dollar Canadian bills to the rest of them, haha.</p>

<p>The trip from the airport to my mom’s place is super long. Not really but it felt long to me. We left the airport around 10 in the morning and arrived around 6 or 7. I have to the say, I was awake for the majority of the ride and I only saw two stop lights. And they weren’t even in Manila. What I did see was a lot of campaign posters (it’s election time here) and tons of tricycles and jeeps passing us by. My uncle who came to get us likes to overtake cars and it kinda gives me a heart attack every time. He even did it in a “no overtaking zone” and I kinda freake out.</p>

<p>But yes we got to my mom’s place. Every one there is shorter than I am, except for my male cousins and uncles. The women are tiny. My Lola is so tiny and short and cute and wrinkly and toothless and awehh she’s so adorable. She squeezed my arm, said I was fat (in Tagalog ofc) and squeezed me tight. So cute. ;A; Anyway I went to bed after we ate. The rooms are super hot and super tiny so my mom, my Lola and I slept in one room and my brother and my dad in the other. My brother got the room with air conditioning. -__- But it’s cold-ish at night so I guess it’s okay.</p>

<p>I woke up this morning and it was really bright and I thought I slept in really late but it was actually like six in the morning. Welp.</p>

<p>After we ate breakfast (longanisa with rice, basically a sweet sausage) and took showers (it’s literally a small tiled room outdoors next to the chicken coop and the toilet that’s basically just a hole in the ground so it doesn’t really feel like you’re clean because it smells like shit everywhere) we went to the market, or palinki (idk how to spell that).</p>

<p>There’s so many people in the market!! So many stalls everywhere and people trying to get you to buy stuff. And flies. My brother and I followed our cousin while he was getting groceries and it was fun. He was talking to one of the vendors and as we were leaving he spoke to us in English and the vendor was like, “HOY THEY’RE ENGLISH SPEAKING.” It’s really hard not to speak English in public (we might robbed or something like that). But yes that was fun.</p>

<p>We got home and it was only 9. So we just lazed about, taking a nap, watching some TV, and now I’m sitting in a hot cramped room watching the boys play CoD. It’s now 3 in the afternoon.</p>

        <p>I let Pure-Orenji.info go because of money issues. This is not the case here. I don&rsquo;t think anyone (except for maybe one or two people) followed Pure Orenji back when it was a blog. During that time I was going through a weird relationship thing. Also around that time I bought Brokenphrases.info. The name &ldquo;Brokenphrases&rdquo; was highly inspired by my (lack of) social skills and as much as I don&rsquo;t like to admit it, a poem written by the other person in said relationship.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost three years since I&rsquo;ve spoken to that person and we left on bitter terms. I should have gotten rid of Brokenphrases right there but I didn&rsquo;t because I was still clinging onto my feelings for that person. Even though it&rsquo;s been such a long time ago and I don&rsquo;t feel any bitterness anymore (more like awkwardness), I sometimes feel weird having Brokenphrases as a domain. It&rsquo;s pretty much like regularly wearing a shirt that someone you once hated gave you. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still on the fence about it. If I were to let this site go, I&rsquo;d buy another domain name or merge it with another one of my websites. Any thoughts?</p>
