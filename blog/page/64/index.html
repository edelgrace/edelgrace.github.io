<p><strong>Suggested Reading</strong> is a weekly feature that runs every, you guessed it, Wednesday. In this feature, a website, blog, or article is showcased for further reading. One of the best things about the Internet is the ability to share. So why not take advantage of that and share some of my favourite things to read on the web? This week&rsquo;s SR is a multimedia blog hosted on Tumblr, <a href="http://thecommonlibrarian.tumblr.com/">The Common Librarian</a>. <span id="more-158"></span></p>

<p><strong>Straight from the blog:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m a thirty-year-old book nerd, doing a Masters in Library and Information Science in Dublin. If you’re a librarian, a student librarian, or a library enthusiast, do let me know so I can follow your blog.</p>

<p>My interests are varied. They include reading, thinking about reading, planning to read and buying and/or borrowing books. I also try to write a bit too. OK, so maybe not very varied. I also like drinking tea, eating gluten-free biscuits (only the nice ones) and playing with my cocker spaniel, Minerva.</p>

<p>I spend much too much time online. I indulge in a little* bit of fangirling. I have another blog in which I dabble in obsess over Potter, Downton Abbey, Sherlock, Doctor Who and other fandoms. If you’d like my URL, drop a note in my askbox.</p>

<ul>
<li>May be an incredible understatement.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I discovered this blog while browsing the &ldquo;MLIS&rdquo; tag on Tumblr. To be honest, I haven&rsquo;t officially followed her on Tumblr until now but I subscribed to her RSS feed ages ago and have been reading her posts that way. The Common Librarian is a wonderful read on all things librarian. One of my favourite things about this blog is that it&rsquo;s not all informative, but also quite personal. The multimedia posts, such as photos, videos, debates with other users, and links help with this (and they all relate to libraries and books!). While reading her blog, you can definitely tell that she has passion for what she does and that makes it enjoyable for the reader.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a nice personal blog about libraries, book, and general MLIS adventures, The Common Librarian might just be for you.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I asked The Common Librarian a question on Tumblr and she replied to me. :)</p>

<p><strong>If you could tell a random stranger about your profession in less than 50 words, what would you say?</strong></p>

<p>We are educators, information detectives, literacy advocates, fiction-pushers, knowledge protectors, eternal learners, public liaisons, budgeting wizards, managers, team-workers, magic facilitators, human search engines, nerds, geeks and readers. :)</p>

        </div>

        

<p>A new year, a new set of resolutions, probably another year where said resolutions are never fulfilled. But it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to at least dream, yeah? Usually most people do these resolution posts on the first day of the year, but I do mine second! No, I was busy with the opening of <a href="http://thelibrariancode.com">my new blog</a>, go check it out. On with the post!</p>

<h2 id="1-post-more">1. Post more</h2>

<p>I hate how this has to be a resolution, but yes, I want to post more. Mostly for my sanity and to make sure that the money I spend on domains are actually worth it (broke university student is broke, I need a job). Plus, I want to look back on my blogs and read my posts and reminisce because I like reminiscing.</p>

<h2 id="2-catch-up-on-my-book-log-at-least-a-little">2. Catch up on my book log, at least a little</h2>

<p>In my <a href="/getting-through-it/">last blog post</a>, one of my goals for the Christmas break was to catch on my book log, <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">Room 304</a>. My total goal for this year is to add 200 hundred more books to the database.</p>

<h2 id="3-spend-only-an-hour-per-week-on-tumblr">3. Spend only an hour per week on Tumblr</h2>

<p>Last week I spent 3 hours on Tumblr, which is AMAZING compared to my all time record of 12 hours of Tumblr during a <strong>school</strong> week. I&rsquo;m a bit ashamed of that statistic. I&rsquo;ve been trying to post less and browse less so hopefully that 3 hours will dwindle down to less than an hour soon! So far, it&rsquo;s Wednesday and I&rsquo;ve already spent 1 hour on Tumblr, but some of this week wasn&rsquo;t 2013 so I&rsquo;ll let that slide. But no more Tumblr for the rest of the week!</p>

<h2 id="4-don-t-gain-weight-lose-more-than-5-pounds">4. Don&rsquo;t gain weight/lose more than 5 pounds</h2>

<p>Most of my days are spent sitting around &ldquo;doing&rdquo; school work or trying to get ahead in programming languages. As you can guess, the pounds have been adding up. I&rsquo;m short so even gaining a pound shows (unfortunately). I want to stay the weight I am now, but if I start unintentionally losing weight (haha that&rsquo;s funny), I don&rsquo;t want to lose too much weight. Five pounds sounds like a good number.</p>

<h2 id="5-don-t-skip-any-lectures">5. Don&rsquo;t skip any lectures</h2>

<p>Last semester I spent a lot of time &ldquo;rearranging&rdquo; lecture time to work on labs or projects (ENGG 200/design was a pain in the butt) or studying for mid-terms. I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that but the temptation is too great. Especially when you find yourself sitting in a lecture that should have 200+ students but only 3 rows of seats are filled and the professor isn&rsquo;t making any sense.</p>

<h2 id="6-stop-doing-assignments-the-day-before">6. Stop doing assignments the day before</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m so guilty of doing this. Last semester a lot of my assignments were due either on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. As a result, a lot of procrastination was done. I need to get out of this habit and quick.</p>

<h2 id="8-be-productive-during-reading-week">8. Be productive during reading week</h2>

<p>Reading week is a &ldquo;week&rdquo;/period preceding examinations according to Wikipedia. Last semester, reading week came along and I was so pumped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do so much studying and do all of my homework!&rdquo; Did it happen? Nope.</p>

<h2 id="9-actually-finish-some-reading-challenges">9. Actually finish some reading challenges</h2>

<p>Click <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/2012-reading-challenges">here</a> and look at my pitiful attempt at all of those reading challenges. I want to read a lot of books in 2012 but nope, that didn&rsquo;t happen. I&rsquo;m only doing 2 challenges this year, the A-Z challenge and to read 100 books (manga and novels).</p>

<h2 id="10-make-something-for-github">10. Make something for GitHub</h2>

<p>I made a GitHub account but it&rsquo;s very empty and lonely. I need something to work on as a side project. I just want something <strong>there</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="11-keep-in-touch-with-my-spiritual-side">11. Keep in touch with my spiritual side</h2>

<p>In light of all of the crazy things going around me, I want to always keep in mind of the bigger (spiritual) picture. It&rsquo;s so easy to lose focus. Admittedly, I haven&rsquo;t been the most &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; person ever but I hope that will change.</p>

<h2 id="12-3-0-gpa-for-this-semester">12. 3.0 GPA for this semester</h2>

<p>If other people can do it, so can I! I&rsquo;m aiming for the 3.0. It will come. IT WILL. No longer shall I be dangerously tip toeing the line between passing and failing!</p>

<h2 id="13-get-a-summer-job">13. Get a summer job</h2>

<p>This is the most important one. I have no volunteer (unless altar serving counts) or work experience. How awful would that look if it stayed that way until I graduated? I need a summer job. Thank goodness summer is so long (four months, thank you so much). Hopefully I can actually find a job with my lack of experience&hellip;</p>

  </div>

<p>They say that one of the easiest ways to lose weight is to keep track of what you&rsquo;re eating. I&rsquo;ve decided to apply this to my own life in order to lose some weight. I&rsquo;m not talking about the physical kind of weight but the dead weight that everyone carries around and hinders them in some way. This blog, The Librarian Code, will help me to lose some of that dead weight.<span id="more-127"></span></p>

<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m an undergraduate at the University of Calgary, majoring in engineering. My hope is to get into software engineering in the fall. While at my university, the cut off GPA for software engineering is not high, I still want to be able to get good marks. So far, I&rsquo;m a C+/B- student and I want that to change. I know it&rsquo;s hard to get good marks in engineering. Despite that, after I finish with my degree and dabble in the video game industry (Ubisoft, here I come?), I want to go to the University of Alberta to pursue my MLIS (Masters of Library and Information Science) to become a &ldquo;real librarian&rdquo;. Grad school requires more than passing marks, of course. So yes, my marks and general &ldquo;career&rdquo; skills need to improve.</p>

<p>How exactly is blogging going to help with that? Well, let&rsquo;s go back to the diet analogy. The thing about food diaries is that listing everything you eat forces you to reflect on your eating habits. As you point out your flaws to yourself, you (should) feel more motivated to change. As you do change and eat healthier, less, more, etc. you also keep track of your progress. Watching yourself get better (once again, should) give you more incentive to continue and more confidence in yourself. This is the same for The Librarian Code.</p>

<p>That being said, there are four main things that I hope to accomplish with this blog:</p>

<ul>
<li>To reflect more deeply on my university experiences, especially the content.</li>
<li>To connect with fellow engineers and librarians, whether they be &ldquo;in the making&rdquo; like myself, or not.</li>
<li>To keep in the loop with the engineering and library world.</li>
<li>To display my projects and learn more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this will be as much of an adventure for you as it will be for me!</p>

<p>Christmas break is here and so is a new layout. It&rsquo;s not my own, but I was just enamored by it&rsquo;s simplicity. Enjoy! Whew, I finally made it through my very first semester in university. I must say, it was quite a ride. I&rsquo;m glad I got through it. Finals are behind me and now I can just relax. Even though I do want to take this time to chill out and slow down the pace, I also want to be productive. I know, I know. What is there to be productive for? School&rsquo;s done for the semester! I&rsquo;ve actually got a couple of things that I want to accomplish during the break. In fact, I&rsquo;ve actually done a couple of those things already.</p>

<h2 id="get-my-id">Get my ID</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have an ID yet, mainly because I haven&rsquo;t bothered getting my drivers permit. I&rsquo;m really far behind on that, maybe this summer I&rsquo;ll get it (I say that all summer, every summer). Not having an ID is quite concerning, considering that I&rsquo;ll be 18 before the year ends. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a clubbing or party person, but I don&rsquo;t want to be caught in a situation where I need an ID and I don&rsquo;t have it. Plus, I&rsquo;m pretty sure there has to be some law out there saying that I need to have one on my person at all times.</p>

<h2 id="renew-my-library-card">Renew my library card</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m definitely getting my library card renewed! After I get my ID, that is. Once I&rsquo;m legally an adult, I need photo ID to renew my library card. I can no longer rely on my parents to provide that information for me (sad face). Going along with the theme of libraries, I want to work at the library. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be at a public library but any library would be good. I wish I had pushed harder for working at a university library when there was an opening there. My parents didn&rsquo;t want me working during university but now I&rsquo;m going to try a bit harder to convince them otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="clean-out-all-of-my-e-mail-inboxes">Clean out all of my e-mail inboxes</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how or why I accumulate as much e-mail as I do. I have around five e-mail accounts, not including all of my admin@domain.com e-mails. Prior to deleting all the unimportant e-mails, each of my accounts had around 1,000 to 2,000 (unread) e-mails, not including the ones that I <strong>have</strong> read. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy. Plus there&rsquo;s all the folders that I had to go through to weed out things that are out of date, and such. Call me crazy or not, but I actually did this all of yesterday. Thank goodness for the &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; and &ldquo;filter&rdquo; functions in Hotmail and Gmail. Who knew that I had 300+ e-mails from Tumblr telling me &ldquo;x&rdquo; person followed me, liked this, reblogged that, asked this, and replied to that?</p>

<h2 id="forwarding-all-of-my-e-mail-to-one-account">Forwarding all of my e-mail to one account</h2>

<p>Having more than five accounts across multiple domains is tough to keep track out. I migrated all of my e-mails to one account on Gmail. Gmail&rsquo;s filters is awesome for sorting mail into different labels so I can know which e-mail came from where. Plus, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to forward mail too! The only thing I have to do left is to forward all of my university mail, but for some reason it isn&rsquo;t working. I&rsquo;ll have to work on that later.</p>

<h2 id="catch-up-at-least-a-little-bit-with-my-book-log">Catch up (at least a little bit) with my book log</h2>

<p>To those who don&rsquo;t know, I have a <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">book log</a>. I&rsquo;m seriously so far behind with it! On <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> I have just over 1,200 books on my profile. I have 52 books logged in my book log. If this was Tumblr, I&rsquo;d insert an obligatory *shrieks and flies into the sun* somewhere into this paragraph. I&rsquo;m hoping to at least get a hundred books into the database before the Christmas break is over.</p>

<h2 id="website-clean-up">Website clean up</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like taking out some time to do some website clean up. I have so many websites, and I really need to consolidate everything because quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t have time for all of them (not that I did in the first place, haha). I&rsquo;ve narrowed it down to two websites and two other websites that require very little maintenance. Right now I have around around eight or nine. Yeah, some of those got to go!</p>

<h2 id="hush-hush-project">Hush hush project</h2>

<p>One of the four websites that I&rsquo;m keeping will actually be a new website. That means I&rsquo;m letting go of five or six of my current websites. I don&rsquo;t want to say too much about the website now, but I can guarantee that it will be up on New Years!</p>

        <p>Two blog posts in a week?? Is this even possible? I&rsquo;m probably dreaming but it&rsquo;s happening. For real.</p>

<p>Whenever I first get on the computer, I find myself starting out pretty darn focused. I open up Blackboard, see what&rsquo;s new, check my falling grades, cry, start on my assignments, etc. Then suddenly it&rsquo;s 1 in the morning (I&rsquo;m exaggerating, the latest I&rsquo;ve started homework was like 10pm&hellip; Still pretty bad though). So yeah, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;1 in the morning.&rdquo; I have a couple assignments due in a couple of hours and all I&rsquo;ve done was look at fanart of grey kids with horns. My first thought whenever this happens is, &ldquo;Where did all of my time go??&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried tracking the usage of my time before. I used a program called RescueTime but it was too broad. It told me what programs I was using and a few select sites that I frequented but it wasn&rsquo;t enough! Then I downloaded <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timestats/ejifodhjoeeenihgfpjijjmpomaphmah">timeStats</a> last week for Chrome.</p>

<p>Okay, this is a beautiful plugin. It&rsquo;s really easy to use too! Install it and wait and see how much time you waste on YouTube.</p>

<p>But what I really love about this little thing is the categories option. Every single website you visit is stored and you categorize them into your own categories. I made three of them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Productive:</strong> The websites I want to be on. Such as my assignment websites and general uni stuff. Wolfram alpha may or may not be in this category&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>Potential time wasters:</strong> You know those sites that you go on with a purpose but then one hour later, you&rsquo;re still on said site without having fulfilled said purpose? Yeah, those sites.</li>
<li><strong>Time wasters:</strong> YouTube. Tumblr. Twitter. Facebook. Blogs. My blogs. My websites. Anything that can distract me for HOURS from my school work. Sadly, there are a lot of them&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Categories.png"><img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Categories-300x160.png" alt="Category breakdown" title="Categories" width="300" height="160" class="left" /></a></p>

<p>This plugin is really handy in that it displays the data clearly in pie charts and graphs. I&rsquo;m a sucker for pie charts and graphs. So let&rsquo;s look at my Internet usage in terms of these categories for the past week. Now these percentages probably don&rsquo;t mean anything to you so I&rsquo;ll quantify them even further. In other words, I&rsquo;ve spent 22:54 hours on time wasting sites, 11:17 hours on productive sites, and 6:30 hours on potential time wasting sites. I&rsquo;ve spent almost a day a week wasting my time. A day. For every productive hour, I spend two hours doing nothing. That&rsquo;s&hellip; Really discouraging. I mean I know I procrastinate a lot but I didn&rsquo;t know I procrastinated this much. The next burning question in my mind was, what sites do I spend most of my time on? And yes, timeStats gives you the answer to this too!</p>

<p><a href="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sites.png"><img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sites-300x156.png" alt="" title="Sites" width="300" height="156" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>Okay, well I already know the site I visit the most. <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. I spend an ungodly amount of my time on the damned website. A total of 11:50 hours this week. Microblogging is just so fast and easy. And most of all: addictive. All I&rsquo;m doing is looking at pictures people have shared with me and clicking a button to share it with other people. Probably the lowest form of &ldquo;blogging&rdquo; there ever is. But I do it anyway.</p>

<p>The second most visited site is a good one though, with a total of 4:42 hours. MathXL is my homework site for calculus. It&rsquo;s kinda sad that I&rsquo;ve spent 5 hours doing one assignment though. It was a fairly easy assignment too. I&rsquo;ve lost all faith in my calculus abilities&hellip; Not that I had much faith in them to begin with.</p>

<p>Google Docs is seriously SO HANDY for group projects that involve presentations and final reports. It&rsquo;s so much easier that way! <a href="http://mspaintadventures.com">MS Paint Adventures</a> is the website that hosts the web comic, Homestuck. Don&rsquo;t go there. There are over 7000 pages over silly shenanigans that are way too easily to get lost in. <a href="http://www.zachleat.com">Zachleat</a> has a useful alarm app that can play a YouTube video at full blast when it goes off. I use it a lot, apparently. More than I thought I ever did anyway. I also post a lot on the forums over at <a href="ubi.com">Ubi</a>. About the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed series. It&rsquo;s a good game, okay?? And the rest of the sites are pretty straightforward. Like Facebook, for example. It&rsquo;s evil.</p>

<p>So yes, my findings with this little plugin is this: I spend too much time doing irrelevant shi&hellip;take mushrooms on the Internet. But I&rsquo;m working on it! First off by limiting my Tumblr use. Although most of my attempts are like this:</p>

<p>Me: Go away Tumblr, I don&rsquo;t need you anymore. All you do is CAUSE ME PAIN.</p>

<p>Tumblr: Ok bye.</p>

<p>Me: Just kidding. I can&rsquo;t live without you. Never leave me. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?? COME BACK HERE!</p>

<p>Yeah okay I have finals to study for. Bye for now!</p>
