<p><strong>Listening to</strong>: MONSTER by BIGBANG</p>

<p><strong>Fave song atm</strong>: Scream by 2NE1</p>

<p><strong>Fave musician(s) atm</strong>: 2NE1 &amp; BIGBANG</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a coincidence, the song just came up on my iPod. Anyway, a couple days ago I finally decided that I would watch BIGBANG&rsquo;s new music video, MONSTER. I must admit, lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to more and more K-pop these days. I&rsquo;m just craving <strike>more new DIR EN GREY, however they are not inhuman and can&rsquo;t churn out albums out of their asses every day of the year.</strike> new music to listen to and K-pop is new to me so there we go. Also, I have a thing for GD and Seungri, shhh.</p>

<p>Anyway, so my thoughts on the music video.</p>

<p>The beginning actually pretty cool. The prison and the gun shots and the explosions was just so epic. I enjoyed the point of view shots. For some reason I was disappointed that it wasn&rsquo;t the view of actual monster but the band members. Although at the same time, I was just like ASDFGJKL BEAUTIFUL METAPHOR.</p>

<p>So the piano kicks in and my heart starts melting. It&rsquo;s just so melancholy and BEAUTIFULLL. Then I hear TOP&rsquo;s deep lull of a voice and I melt even more. And then I hear GD and I scream inside. But then Taeyang shows up and I&rsquo;m like, WHAT&rsquo;S UP WITH YOUR HAIR?</p>

<p>Seriously, I could not get over Taeyang&rsquo;s hair for most of the music video. It&rsquo;s just so ridiculous like&hellip; I just can&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t even know how to describe it. That&rsquo;s how out of this world it is. It&rsquo;s like he stepped out of a cheesy anime. I just couldn&rsquo;t take it seriously.</p>

<p>I just started and ended that last paragraph with seriously. Wow.</p>

<p>The chorus was pretty good. Considering what I can understand from it. And then Seungri&rsquo;s part. IDGI. Why does Seungri have two lines in every single?! Fantastic Baby. Bad Boy. Lollipop. Everything except Blue, where he sings the chorus (right? I don&rsquo;t even know sorry Seungri). Anyway, another post on why I love Seungri will be coming soon.</p>

<p>Despite all the crazy effects, real life anime GD kicking a statue, Daesung&rsquo;s metal booger, Taeyang&rsquo;s wtf hair, TOP&rsquo;s overall sexiness, and Seungri&rsquo;s two liner, I would say that the most memorable part of the music video is the end.</p>

<p>In the end, GD walks out of a bunker and it&rsquo;s snowing. He&rsquo;s looking around, looking like number 3 from Kids Next Door with his blonde mushroom hair. But then there&rsquo;s these beautiful strings that just pass through your ears and into your heart and the painful gut twisting lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m sick. I think I&rsquo;m sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every time I listen to this song, I&rsquo;m always waiting for the end. Ugh, too good.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I meant to post last on the 15th but I just couldn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I should blog. It just didn&rsquo;t feel right to do so. Even now, I&rsquo;m not so comfortable posting this but I just need to get it out, which is why it&rsquo;s private. Only three people have the password to my private posts so I guess it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>

<p>On the 15th I received a text from a friend asking about our mutual friend, T.</p>

<p>T&rsquo;s one of my closest guy friends whom I affectionly call Muffin. We went to the same junior high together and we both excelled at the extreme sport of procrastination. I told Muffin everything about life. I trusted him with all my secrets. However, within the past year I haven&rsquo;t really talked to him that much. We&rsquo;d see each other in the halls and say a quick &ldquo;Hi how are you?&rdquo; and go on to our classes. Sometimes there was a hug. Him ruffling my hair. Poking each others sides. The usual friendship shenanigans.</p>

<p>So my friend asked if I had talked to Muffin lately and to check his Facebook page. I said no and proceeded to look at his wall on Facebook. There was a single post that I saw right away. It was a RIP message from his sister. At first I couldn&rsquo;t really believe it. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s a practical joke or something.&rdquo; But as people started commenting and more wall posts began to appear, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t a joke. Somehow, I had a small shred of hope that maybe, just maybe, it was a joke after all.</p>

<p>Still, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep right away that night. I cried and prayed that this wasn&rsquo;t real. When I walked into the band room for practice this morning, I felt like throwing up. His sister, M, is in band and plays the flute, just like me. She&rsquo;s the sweetest girl I know and she&rsquo;s always smiling. So when I saw her crying, I was filled with dread. It wasn&rsquo;t a joke. T&rsquo;s really gone.</p>

<p>Me and my friend A didn&rsquo;t say anything but we went over and hugged her. I tried to keep myself from crying because it would just be selfish of me. It was so hard, especially when M started shaking in my arms as she sobbed. The only thought in my head was, &ldquo;T, why did you leave her behind, this sweet little girl who just loves you to death? What happened to make you leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, I didn&rsquo;t really know what happened exactly but I had a vague feeling. I still don&rsquo;t like to say it because it just makes me shiver all over.</p>

<p>First period comes and goes and then it&rsquo;s time for second period. While my teacher was explaining every single meaning of every single sentence and word and punctuation mark of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, another teacher walks in and gives her a sheet of paper. A troubled looked crossed over my teacher&rsquo;s face and she sighed. I clenched my jaw and buried my head into my book.</p>

<p>Half an hour passes and my principal&rsquo;s voice comes onto the intercom, &ldquo;Please excuse this interruption. Teachers please read out the handout you just received. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We learned that over the weekend that T.W. passed away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ground my teeth so that my mouth wouldn&rsquo;t wobble or let out a cry. It was official. Really official this time. I spent the rest of the period trying not to cry. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that Muffin was gone.</p>

<p>After that the week went well actually. I tried not to think about it during the day, and it worked. I said my prayers for him every night.</p>

<p>Friday was the funeral.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to a funeral so I was scared. I was bit late but I managed to see two of my friends who I stood next to the whole time. It was crowded. I kind of expected it. Muffin has a lot friends. He was just so outgoing and cheerful and kind that all kinds of people flocked to him. So we literally stood a few inches away from the entrance where tons of over people where standing as well for the whole time.</p>

<p>Muffin&rsquo;s friend, appropriately nicknamed Cupcake, made a speech. It was wonderful. So many memories flooded into my mind at the time. I giggled at some of the hilarious teenage shenanigans and cried at the parts when it seemed like Cupcake couldn&rsquo;t hold it together. But he did and I never felt so proud for him. This is cheesy, but I was filled with love for some reason.</p>

<p>As it came to a close, I had a sudden urge to see his face. One last time. But I was in the back and I couldn&rsquo;t make it to see him in time. Maybe it was better if I didn&rsquo;t. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have handled it.</p>

<p>When they brought out the coffin, all the emotions I held in that past week burst out of me. I sobbed into my friend&rsquo;s shoulder as I watched as his best friend since the age of seven carried the coffin into the hearse. As I watched as his father quietly sobbed in his arm as the other men held him. As I saw his sister turn her head away and cry out loud. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Was that really Muffin in that coffin? What was his expression? And as silly as this sounds, was it really him? I was filled with immense sorrow and anger at that moment. Anger at myself, anger at him, anger towards whatever had caused this&hellip; I still kind of am but now it&rsquo;s considerably less.</p>

<p>After the hearse drove away, I made me way to say my condolences. All I could say was &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while&rdquo; and I hugged Cupcake for the longest time. I suddenly realized how long it was since I talked to him and how long it was since I told anyone any of my secrets. Then I went to hug Muffin&rsquo;s sister. It was a quick one. I don&rsquo;t know her that well. She looked at me and with the bravest and strongest face I have ever seen she said, &ldquo;If you want anything of Tai&rsquo;s, let me know.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s another topic entirely.</p>

<p>I lingered around. Hugged. Cried. Said good byes. I left feeling better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit unsettled. The halls seem emptier. I miss him. But little by little, I&rsquo;m getting used to it. I&rsquo;m not sure about his family though, especially his sister. They must have it so hard. I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine it. For now, I&rsquo;m going to pray for him and his family. I hope he can hear my prayers.</p>

        <p>Lent is over. I haven&rsquo;t visited Room 304 or Goodreads in over 40 days. Geez, I have a lot of catching up to do. I did read over those 40 days but definitely not a lot. I&rsquo;ve been swamped with school work and going to sleep at midnight every night doesn&rsquo;t leave much time for reading.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve resorted to audiobooks. Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;lazy way of reading&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve been craving some sort of world that I can delve into and just absorb. Lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to audiobooks while doing homework or when I have a free period in class. Somehow I can manage listening perfectly to an audiobook and manage to do calculus questions (and get them right) at the same time.</p>

<p>So far my favourite audiobook is <em>Seriously&hellip; I&rsquo;m Kidding</em> written and narrated by Ellen Degeneres. Usually I&rsquo;m quite weary about celebrities writing books but whew, this one was just so entertaining! Yeah, it&rsquo;s full of laughs but what else do you expect from a comedian? Ellen is just a ball of excitement and fun. Plus, hearing her narrate her own words really made it lively. However, I do want to read the printed version some time soon.</p>

<p>But yeah, I have quite a lot of catching up to do. I wasted my whole Easter Break trying to do homework and I&rsquo;m kicking my butt over it. I said I would do my homework in two days so I can have free time for the rest of the week but that didn&rsquo;t happen. So now I have 130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, couple of questions of calculus, a chapter&rsquo;s worth work of physics, and a workbook in social to do.</p>

<p>After I do all that, hopefully I can update my reading list. Here&rsquo;s what I have so far:</p>

        <p>Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was&hellip; Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &ldquo;play all&rdquo; function so that was interesting. It&rsquo;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. I actually started writing blog posts that I intended to post for later.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s new with my life? Absolutely nothing. I&rsquo;m really getting my butt kicked in everything schoool related. Not literally. But that&rsquo;s not new, I&rsquo;m always getting my butt kicked! I just need to pick up the pace and spring break seems like the greatest oppurtunity to catch up and get on my study horse again.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my little to-do list for the break:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Study for a calculus test.</p></li>

<li><p>Trig review questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Physics homework from last week.</p></li>

<li><p>Activity guide on democracy.</p></li>

<li><p>130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start and finish reading <em>Heart of Darkness</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start reading <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah. I think there&rsquo;s more actually but the most daunting task is those questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I&rsquo;m currently avoiding it but sooner or later I have to do it. I guess looking at that list is motivation in itself. Also, I want to get this done and over with so I have the rest of the break to do whatever I want (sitting at the computer, watching TV, playing video games, and more, haha) instead of doing everything I want first and then staying up until 3 in the morning the day before I go back to school.</p>

<p>On another note, today is my mother&rsquo;s birthday today! She&rsquo;s 53 today. It&rsquo;s interesting how we (we as in teenagers, which I know doesn&rsquo;t apply to all of you out there) get so caught up in our own lives and our growing up but we don&rsquo;t really notice our parent(s)/guardian(s) growing older. Suddenly I notice the wrinkles, the knobby hands, the slightly bent back, and the strands of grey hair. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m starting to appreciate my mom a whole lot more. Happy birthday mom!</p>

        <p>Tomorrow marks the beginning of Lent. Last year I gave up Tumblr for Lent. This year I&rsquo;m giving up using the Internet (minus school things). So for the next 40 days I won&rsquo;t be posting, commenting, reading, e-mailing, Twittering, Facebooking or anything that has to do with the Internet. My poor Neopets are going to starve to almost death (that&rsquo;s the the first thought that came to my mind, how sad). I&rsquo;m not sure if I can do it but hopefully I can. I enjoy testing my discipline but I always feel frustrated when I&rsquo;m tempted. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I got my diploma results back. In my province, anyone taking grade twelve courses have to take diplomas, which are basically just final exams.</p>

<p>So the mail came and I stared at the envelope. I opened it in a frenzy and just held the piece of paper. I was scared to open it. When I did, I let out a sigh of relief. I got 86% on my math diploma, well above the 75% I was expecting. My overall mark for math went down 1% which I&rsquo;m thoroughly grateful for. Now chemistry is a whole different story. My mark dropped 6 whole percentages which kinda sucked but I did better than the 70% I thought I would get. I got a 78% which is decent considering <strike>how much I studied</strike> the lack of studying I did (16 hours including diploma prep).</p>

<p>Yeah. A lot my friends did amazingly well, which I&rsquo;m kind of jealous about. Like in the 90s range! Guhh, I wish I studied harder, especially for chemistry. At least I still meet the requirements for engineering which is my main goal, as many of you already know.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s it for today. Goodnight!</p>
