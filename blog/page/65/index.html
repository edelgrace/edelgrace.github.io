        <p>I meant to post last on the 15th but I just couldn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I should blog. It just didn&rsquo;t feel right to do so. Even now, I&rsquo;m not so comfortable posting this but I just need to get it out, which is why it&rsquo;s private. Only three people have the password to my private posts so I guess it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>

<p>On the 15th I received a text from a friend asking about our mutual friend, T.</p>

<p>T&rsquo;s one of my closest guy friends whom I affectionly call Muffin. We went to the same junior high together and we both excelled at the extreme sport of procrastination. I told Muffin everything about life. I trusted him with all my secrets. However, within the past year I haven&rsquo;t really talked to him that much. We&rsquo;d see each other in the halls and say a quick &ldquo;Hi how are you?&rdquo; and go on to our classes. Sometimes there was a hug. Him ruffling my hair. Poking each others sides. The usual friendship shenanigans.</p>

<p>So my friend asked if I had talked to Muffin lately and to check his Facebook page. I said no and proceeded to look at his wall on Facebook. There was a single post that I saw right away. It was a RIP message from his sister. At first I couldn&rsquo;t really believe it. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s a practical joke or something.&rdquo; But as people started commenting and more wall posts began to appear, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t a joke. Somehow, I had a small shred of hope that maybe, just maybe, it was a joke after all.</p>

<p>Still, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep right away that night. I cried and prayed that this wasn&rsquo;t real. When I walked into the band room for practice this morning, I felt like throwing up. His sister, M, is in band and plays the flute, just like me. She&rsquo;s the sweetest girl I know and she&rsquo;s always smiling. So when I saw her crying, I was filled with dread. It wasn&rsquo;t a joke. T&rsquo;s really gone.</p>

<p>Me and my friend A didn&rsquo;t say anything but we went over and hugged her. I tried to keep myself from crying because it would just be selfish of me. It was so hard, especially when M started shaking in my arms as she sobbed. The only thought in my head was, &ldquo;T, why did you leave her behind, this sweet little girl who just loves you to death? What happened to make you leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, I didn&rsquo;t really know what happened exactly but I had a vague feeling. I still don&rsquo;t like to say it because it just makes me shiver all over.</p>

<p>First period comes and goes and then it&rsquo;s time for second period. While my teacher was explaining every single meaning of every single sentence and word and punctuation mark of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, another teacher walks in and gives her a sheet of paper. A troubled looked crossed over my teacher&rsquo;s face and she sighed. I clenched my jaw and buried my head into my book.</p>

<p>Half an hour passes and my principal&rsquo;s voice comes onto the intercom, &ldquo;Please excuse this interruption. Teachers please read out the handout you just received. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We learned that over the weekend that T.W. passed away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ground my teeth so that my mouth wouldn&rsquo;t wobble or let out a cry. It was official. Really official this time. I spent the rest of the period trying not to cry. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that Muffin was gone.</p>

<p>After that the week went well actually. I tried not to think about it during the day, and it worked. I said my prayers for him every night.</p>

<p>Friday was the funeral.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to a funeral so I was scared. I was bit late but I managed to see two of my friends who I stood next to the whole time. It was crowded. I kind of expected it. Muffin has a lot friends. He was just so outgoing and cheerful and kind that all kinds of people flocked to him. So we literally stood a few inches away from the entrance where tons of over people where standing as well for the whole time.</p>

<p>Muffin&rsquo;s friend, appropriately nicknamed Cupcake, made a speech. It was wonderful. So many memories flooded into my mind at the time. I giggled at some of the hilarious teenage shenanigans and cried at the parts when it seemed like Cupcake couldn&rsquo;t hold it together. But he did and I never felt so proud for him. This is cheesy, but I was filled with love for some reason.</p>

<p>As it came to a close, I had a sudden urge to see his face. One last time. But I was in the back and I couldn&rsquo;t make it to see him in time. Maybe it was better if I didn&rsquo;t. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have handled it.</p>

<p>When they brought out the coffin, all the emotions I held in that past week burst out of me. I sobbed into my friend&rsquo;s shoulder as I watched as his best friend since the age of seven carried the coffin into the hearse. As I watched as his father quietly sobbed in his arm as the other men held him. As I saw his sister turn her head away and cry out loud. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Was that really Muffin in that coffin? What was his expression? And as silly as this sounds, was it really him? I was filled with immense sorrow and anger at that moment. Anger at myself, anger at him, anger towards whatever had caused this&hellip; I still kind of am but now it&rsquo;s considerably less.</p>

<p>After the hearse drove away, I made me way to say my condolences. All I could say was &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while&rdquo; and I hugged Cupcake for the longest time. I suddenly realized how long it was since I talked to him and how long it was since I told anyone any of my secrets. Then I went to hug Muffin&rsquo;s sister. It was a quick one. I don&rsquo;t know her that well. She looked at me and with the bravest and strongest face I have ever seen she said, &ldquo;If you want anything of Tai&rsquo;s, let me know.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s another topic entirely.</p>

<p>I lingered around. Hugged. Cried. Said good byes. I left feeling better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit unsettled. The halls seem emptier. I miss him. But little by little, I&rsquo;m getting used to it. I&rsquo;m not sure about his family though, especially his sister. They must have it so hard. I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine it. For now, I&rsquo;m going to pray for him and his family. I hope he can hear my prayers.</p>

        <p>Lent is over. I haven&rsquo;t visited Room 304 or Goodreads in over 40 days. Geez, I have a lot of catching up to do. I did read over those 40 days but definitely not a lot. I&rsquo;ve been swamped with school work and going to sleep at midnight every night doesn&rsquo;t leave much time for reading.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve resorted to audiobooks. Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;lazy way of reading&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve been craving some sort of world that I can delve into and just absorb. Lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to audiobooks while doing homework or when I have a free period in class. Somehow I can manage listening perfectly to an audiobook and manage to do calculus questions (and get them right) at the same time.</p>

<p>So far my favourite audiobook is <em>Seriously&hellip; I&rsquo;m Kidding</em> written and narrated by Ellen Degeneres. Usually I&rsquo;m quite weary about celebrities writing books but whew, this one was just so entertaining! Yeah, it&rsquo;s full of laughs but what else do you expect from a comedian? Ellen is just a ball of excitement and fun. Plus, hearing her narrate her own words really made it lively. However, I do want to read the printed version some time soon.</p>

<p>But yeah, I have quite a lot of catching up to do. I wasted my whole Easter Break trying to do homework and I&rsquo;m kicking my butt over it. I said I would do my homework in two days so I can have free time for the rest of the week but that didn&rsquo;t happen. So now I have 130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, couple of questions of calculus, a chapter&rsquo;s worth work of physics, and a workbook in social to do.</p>

<p>After I do all that, hopefully I can update my reading list. Here&rsquo;s what I have so far:</p>

        <p>Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was&hellip; Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &ldquo;play all&rdquo; function so that was interesting. It&rsquo;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. I actually started writing blog posts that I intended to post for later.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s new with my life? Absolutely nothing. I&rsquo;m really getting my butt kicked in everything schoool related. Not literally. But that&rsquo;s not new, I&rsquo;m always getting my butt kicked! I just need to pick up the pace and spring break seems like the greatest oppurtunity to catch up and get on my study horse again.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my little to-do list for the break:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Study for a calculus test.</p></li>

<li><p>Trig review questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Physics homework from last week.</p></li>

<li><p>Activity guide on democracy.</p></li>

<li><p>130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start and finish reading <em>Heart of Darkness</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start reading <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah. I think there&rsquo;s more actually but the most daunting task is those questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I&rsquo;m currently avoiding it but sooner or later I have to do it. I guess looking at that list is motivation in itself. Also, I want to get this done and over with so I have the rest of the break to do whatever I want (sitting at the computer, watching TV, playing video games, and more, haha) instead of doing everything I want first and then staying up until 3 in the morning the day before I go back to school.</p>

<p>On another note, today is my mother&rsquo;s birthday today! She&rsquo;s 53 today. It&rsquo;s interesting how we (we as in teenagers, which I know doesn&rsquo;t apply to all of you out there) get so caught up in our own lives and our growing up but we don&rsquo;t really notice our parent(s)/guardian(s) growing older. Suddenly I notice the wrinkles, the knobby hands, the slightly bent back, and the strands of grey hair. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m starting to appreciate my mom a whole lot more. Happy birthday mom!</p>

        <p>Tomorrow marks the beginning of Lent. Last year I gave up Tumblr for Lent. This year I&rsquo;m giving up using the Internet (minus school things). So for the next 40 days I won&rsquo;t be posting, commenting, reading, e-mailing, Twittering, Facebooking or anything that has to do with the Internet. My poor Neopets are going to starve to almost death (that&rsquo;s the the first thought that came to my mind, how sad). I&rsquo;m not sure if I can do it but hopefully I can. I enjoy testing my discipline but I always feel frustrated when I&rsquo;m tempted. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I got my diploma results back. In my province, anyone taking grade twelve courses have to take diplomas, which are basically just final exams.</p>

<p>So the mail came and I stared at the envelope. I opened it in a frenzy and just held the piece of paper. I was scared to open it. When I did, I let out a sigh of relief. I got 86% on my math diploma, well above the 75% I was expecting. My overall mark for math went down 1% which I&rsquo;m thoroughly grateful for. Now chemistry is a whole different story. My mark dropped 6 whole percentages which kinda sucked but I did better than the 70% I thought I would get. I got a 78% which is decent considering <strike>how much I studied</strike> the lack of studying I did (16 hours including diploma prep).</p>

<p>Yeah. A lot my friends did amazingly well, which I&rsquo;m kind of jealous about. Like in the 90s range! Guhh, I wish I studied harder, especially for chemistry. At least I still meet the requirements for engineering which is my main goal, as many of you already know.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s it for today. Goodnight!</p>

    <strong>Follow Friday</strong> is a weekly book meme hosted by <a href="http://parajunkee.com/">Parajunkee</a> and <a href="http://www.alisoncanread.com/">Alison Can Read</a>. In this meme, us bloggers are asked a question to which we respond to by posting on our blogs. Other bloggers can see our answers, comment, and follow!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This week's question is: <strong>What’s the most unique character name you’ve come across?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the spin-off novel of the popular manga and anime series of Death Note, <em>Death Note: Another Note</em> by NISIOSIN, there are a whole load of crazy names. Beyond Birthday, Believe Bridesmaid, Quarter Queen, and Backyard Bottomslash are some of them. They are ridiculous yet unique. The names are mostly plot devices and because it's an English translation, they needed to make up names that would make the story make sense in English. Still doesn't take away from the fact that it's ridiculous.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If we're talking about characters in general, there's this one character from the video game series <em>Assassin's Creed</em> who has the name Altair. It's pronounced like "Al-tie-air" which is pretty cool. There's also a character named Ezio. Cool names if you ask me.
