        <p>These past two months or so have been great for new music. G-Dragon&rsquo;s comeback and news of Coheed and Cambria&rsquo;s new album. So many good things are happening! Lately, there has been three songs that I&rsquo;ve been playing over and over again.</p>

<div class="left">
  <div class="picture" style="width:322px;">
    <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9mm9c6ufp1qarjfpo1_500.gif"><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9mm9c6ufp1qarjfpo1_500.gif" width="322" height="184" alt="That XX" /></a><br />A gif made by <a href="http://vitadolce-moderato.tumblr.com/">vitadolce-moderato</a>.
  </div>
</div>

<p>The first one worth mentioning is G-Dragon&rsquo;s new ballad, <strong><a href="http://musical.brokenphrases.info/2012/09/three-songs-ive-been-playing-on-repeat/www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHQNYvaZnnY">That XX</a></strong>. For those who don&rsquo;t know, G-Dragon is a South Korean artist part of the boy group BIG BANG. I loved <strong>That XX</strong> the moment I saw a gif of it on Tumblr. As soon as I did see the gif, I went straight to YouTube. I was not expecting a ballad from G-Dragon, to be honest. His last single release was <strong>One of a Kind</strong> and just by reading the title, you can tell immediately that it was one of those obnoxious arrogant songs that artists like to create these days.</p>

<p><strong>That XX</strong> strongly contrasts <strong>One of a Kind</strong>. It&rsquo;s mostly just G-Dragon&rsquo;s sweet voice singing accompanied by an acoustic guitar. Definitely not a song to dance wildly to at parties. It&rsquo;s really bittersweet, telling the tale of a love triangle. G-Dragon just sounds so sincere in his singing and vulnerable, I love it. The lyrics are extremely relatable, however, nothing too heart wrenching.</p>

<p>Next up is a cover by YouTube user, Joel (<a href="http://youtube.com/Jbry2k8">Jbry2k8</a>), of the song <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZf4G0FGiNs">Smile</a></strong> originally by the Japanese band Monkey Majik. Just a bit of background on Monkey Majik, they&rsquo;re a Japanese-Canadian band. Two members are brothers and hail from Canada, and the other two (or three?) are Japanese. Fun fact, Blaise Plant (the bassist) went to Alberta for university, at University of Lethbridge. I&rsquo;m still wondering why people from Ontario would go all the way to Alberta for university, and to U of L at that. I have a two friends who go there actually but still. U of L? Well, I won&rsquo;t judge too much.</p>

<p>Back to the song, this is wonderful. A bit pitchy at times, but still wonderful. I&rsquo;m absolutely in love with Joel&rsquo;s voice. He has sort of a raspy down to earth tone that is just so, <em>wow</em>. The song just fits his voice perfectly as well. It almost seems as if it was made for him. <strong>Smile</strong> is another acoustic song, sung entirely in English. The lyrics are beautiful and they really resonate with me. It kinda inspires me in a way. I just love the chorus. <em>I caught a bolt of lightning, put it in my pocket as a good luck charm. And then I started thinking, maybe this piece of fire will protect me from harm.</em> Is that not beautiful? Although, I wish some of the mixing was done better. There are some times when Joel&rsquo;s voice is louder than other times and it slightly annoys me but eh.</p>

<p>Last and certainly not least is Coheed and Cambria&rsquo;s new song, <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRoN4_kG6XM">Domino the Destitute</a></strong>. Oh. My. Gulay. This song is easily my favourite song of the year (so far anyway, as I&rsquo;m still waiting for DIR EN GREY&rsquo;S new single, RINKAKU, to be released this December). I&rsquo;ve almost forgotten how much I love Coheed and Cambria. My friend made me a huge fan of them like two or three years ago. And oh goodness, there is no Coheed song that I do not LOVE. For instance, their album <em>Good Apollo I</em> (shortened of course) is a godsend. I love every single song on the album. I sing along to them every time. They&rsquo;re just that good.</p>

<p>This song. Oh, this song. <strong>Domino the Destitute</strong> is wonderful. It&rsquo;s around 8 minutes long and you wouldn&rsquo;t tell at all. The lead singer, Claudio Sanchez, is an amazing song writer and vocalist. His range is absolutely beautiful and oh I cannot even begin to describe my love for this song. There&rsquo;s an intense sound to it, it&rsquo;s just perfect in all aspects. The guitar work is pretty amazing and me oh my, nothing is out of place. Nothing. Clean, sharp, beautiful. So catchy, so amazing. I swear I&rsquo;m not a Coheed fangirl, I am far from it. It gets better every time I listen to it. Ugh. Just take my word for it when I say it&rsquo;s a great song.</p>

        <p>Today was my first day of orientation week! While it was fun, I found that it was lacking a bit somehow. I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to see how it&rsquo;ll pan out for the rest of the week. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be better than today.</p>

<p>It was hectic. I left the house at 7:24 got on the train around 7:40 and got there around 8:20. I was early but apparently too early. No one was there. Like hardly anyone! I wandered over to the engineering building after being semi-lost and thankfully (after a few minutes) orientation leaders began to show up.</p>

<p>Deanne (a girl who posted on the group page a lot) and I were the first ones from our group there. Our leader came soon-ish though. His name Hasheem or something but he said we could just call him &ldquo;H.&rdquo; Dylan quickly came soon after.</p>

<p>After the majority of our group showed up, we learned our engineering chant for the pep rally, we&rsquo;re given orange shirts (orange for engineers apparently), did some ice breaker games, and went off to the Oval. Lots of people. Lots. Of. People. Arts has a ton of people in it, I was surprised. Poor Kinesiology though. Maybe less than ten rows of them.</p>

<p>The rally involved lots of screaming but engineers are seriously lacking the spirit LIKE COME ON!</p>

<p>The whole pep rally was pretty cool though.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Tomorrow I start university. Thank goodness for Labour day. I&rsquo;ve never really understood what Labour day is. All I know is that it delays school by one more day and that&rsquo;s all I need to know to be thankful for it. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not at all that excited to be honest. Technically, classes don&rsquo;t start until next week so that&rsquo;s delayed even further.</p>

<p>This week is all orientation. Basically, just having fun and getting to know the campus and mingling with other potential classmates. It&rsquo;s all really well organized, from what I&rsquo;ve seen so far. You have to register and everything and you get put into groups based on what you&rsquo;re taking. Thankfully, I know one other person in my group. However, that&rsquo;s also a bad thing in a way. I&rsquo;m more likely to cling and not socialize at all if I know someone else. We&rsquo;ll have to see about that.</p>

<p>So this week&rsquo;s events include tours, games, sport events, going to IKEA (yeah, IKEA, I&rsquo;m not kidding), and more. There&rsquo;s a lot to do this week, I&rsquo;m somewhat overwhelmed but somewhat excited. Excited because it sounds extremely fun and overwhelmed because ugh, people.</p>

<p>This summer I&rsquo;ve been staying at home like a boring person. I haven&rsquo;t interacted with my friends since Stampede week and that was the first week of July. It&rsquo;s the first week of September. I&rsquo;m so accustomed to being cooped up into my room. I might get shocked by being surrounded by a scarily large amount of people (3243 people and counting to be exact). I&rsquo;m nervous. I get such weird anxiety around people. Last Saturday I was freaking out over picking up my textbooks. It went smoothly but I was shaking a little bit. Hopefully that won&rsquo;t happen at all this week.</p>

<p>So yes, my last day of freedom. I&rsquo;m going to spend it on Tumblr and talking to people on Facebook. Well, at least that&rsquo;s the plan. What do I even do on my last day of freedom? All I know is that I&rsquo;m going to bed super duper early because transit sucks&hellip;</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>These summer months has been filled with e-mails from my university and just me chatting on the Internet. As September is coming closer everyday, I&rsquo;m getting pretty excited, nervous, and really bummed out. This morning, I received an e-mail listing all of the things I should get done before school starts. Most of them are finished, but there are three major things that I can&rsquo;t actually do just yet.</p>

<p><strong>My picture ID</strong></p>

<p>I have to submit a picture of myself online for ID card, ONEcard is what my university calls. The only problem is that our only camera (that&rsquo;s not the camera on my iPod) was stolen when my dad went to the Philippines. I&rsquo;m really regretting that. My graduation pictures were on that camera and I forgot to transfer those pictures onto my computer. Good thing I managed to print some of them off but they&rsquo;re really low quality.</p>

<p><strong>UPASS</strong></p>

<p>One of the perks of my university is that we pay a small fee for a semster&rsquo;s worth of transit use. Seeing as I don&rsquo;t drive yet, I need this because I&rsquo;ll be taking the train. They say you can get your UPASS stickers now but you need a ONEcard to put the UPASS sticker on. And I don&rsquo;t have one because I don&rsquo;t have a camera. Ah, what a dilemma!</p>

<p><strong>Textbooks</strong></p>

<p>Textbook lists are finally out and I viewed all my textbooks for this semester, and the total comes around to $450. At first I was like, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not that bad!&rdquo; but then I realized that&rsquo;s only one semester. I want to buy books as soon as possible but I&rsquo;m not sure if I should go secondhand or if I should even buy all of them. I have to wait a couple of hours anyway because I don&rsquo;t have a credit card.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I went shopping for school supplies a couple of days ago. It doesn&rsquo;t look like a lot on paper, but it actually is a lot, as I&rsquo;m sure most of you will know. So here&rsquo;s what I got:</p>

<ul>
<li>A crap load of pens, pencils, erasers, and highlighters</li>
<li>Sticky notes and sticky page flag thingies</li>
<li>A binder</li>
<li>An expandable file folder (a suggestion from <a href="http://fadedout.com">Kim</a> in this <a href="http://fadedout.com/2012/04/13/tips-for-success-in-school/">article</a>)</li>
<li>A planner agenda thingy</li>
<li>A couple of notebooks</li>
</ul>

<p>So while all of that is happening, I&rsquo;m talking to my Internet friends. One of my friends is a math genius. He&rsquo;s going to Oxford for goodness sakes. He was showing me some of the tests he took and I realized that I really don&rsquo;t remember anything I learned last semester. Differentiate? Gradient? Tangent lines? I&rsquo;m thinking that I need to brush up on my calculus and all around math skills before I go back to university. Like&hellip; It looks quite manageable but my mind is drawing a blank right now. I should probably go hit the books&hellip;</p>

</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finally been officially accepted into the engineering program at my local university!! I&rsquo;m super crazy excited for university. I can&rsquo;t wait to start a new clean slate. New school supplies (I admit, I enjoy this part the most), new subjects, new campus, new professors, new schedule, new everything. Speaking of schedules, I&rsquo;ve had my schedule done since May but I was hesitant to post it, seeing as I wasn&rsquo;t 100% sure I was going to be accepted. I didn&rsquo;t personally do my schedule though. Prospective engineers are a special bunch, apparently it&rsquo;s too confusing if we make our schedules, so the department puts us into &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; with predetermined schedules. That means, I have the same schedule as a couple of other students as well. I kind of feel sorry for those students, because I feel like the schedule I have is horribly balanced. I&rsquo;m not too sure if that&rsquo;s the norm, though. It probably is. My Thursdays are killer in my first semester. And in my second semester, I don&rsquo;t have any lectures or labs every second Monday. I should be happy about this development but I feel like I&rsquo;m going to be screwed by it later on&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  In another news, I'm currently watching DIR EN GREY's 24 Hour Special Program on Niconico (or is it Nico Nico?). Currently it's at 14 hours and 52 minutes. I definitely did not stay to watch the whole thing, but I sure want to watch the rest of the 10 hours. So, I'm going to try to pull an all nighter. Will it happen? Probably not. Currently, the song that's playing is Dead Tree. Ugh, the sound of the bass in this song is seriously gratifying. I'd rather not go more into my Diru adventures, so I'll end it here. Although, you can probably go see some of my Diru woohoo over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/erzadel&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;my Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Why would you even want to do that though?
