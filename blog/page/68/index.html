        <p>Today, my high school hosted a blood donation centre. I wanted to donate blood because, well, it&rsquo;s for a good cause, right? I drank tons of water the day of and the day before so in my morning classes I was going to the washroom a whole lot. So, I went to donate blood during lunch time. I filled out a form, got a drop of blood tested for my iron level, answered some questions (sexual history, travelling, and any other things that could influence whether or not my blood is good to donate or not).</p>

<p>So I got all that done and went on to the dreaded donating chair. It looked like some kind of torture device, haha! The woman who prepared me was a sweet Filipino lady. When she told me to look away, and I felt the needle pierce through my skin, then I heard a &ldquo;oh no.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s never a good thing to hear when there&rsquo;s needles involved. Thankfully, she just missed my vein. That also meant that I couldn&rsquo;t donate blood. &ldquo;Next time!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sorry to poke you for nothing!&rdquo; I guess the only good thing was the fact that I missed part of my social class!</p>

<p>When I arrived I heard my social teacher complaining about how donating blood was sucking the life out of his class&hellip; Haha. Too true! We were awfully dead silent and unresponsive. Which really contrasted to my next period class where we had a work period and everyone was jumping around and yelling.</p>

<p>My day was kind of okay I guess. Now I&rsquo;m dead tired and my arm kind of hurts. Well, I did get free pizza and two juice boxes!</p>

        <p>January was a mostly boring month. Filled with studying, tears, gaming, eating, sleeping, more tears, and a bit more studying. The only exciting day was yesterday, which was the first day of the semester. The last semester of high school. Oh, the end is near.</p>

<p>One of my the girls in my section told me that there was band practice the morning of the first day of semester. I went to school at seven and&hellip; No band practice. There were people there but not my crowd. Now, we have cubby holes in the band room. We usually leave our stuff on the floor but now we have cubby holes which is kind of inconvenient since they&rsquo;re upstairs. I kinda wish they didn&rsquo;t make them but at the same time, the band room always looks like a hurricane swept through. Plus, it&rsquo;s a safety hazard!</p>

<p>Anyway, my new schedule for this semester is calculus first period, English second, social third, and then physics last. It&rsquo;s a bit heavy (for high school anyway). I&rsquo;m already drowning in homework! Ah, well I better get used to it if I&rsquo;m doing engineering in university.</p>

<p>Today in English, my teacher started throwing deadlines at us and I was feeling overwhelmed already. Then she showed us exemplar essays&hellip; Oh goodness, my writing is nowhere near that level! I have a lot of work to do this semester. :S I think English is the course I&rsquo;m most worried about.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m going to try my best to post as much as I can. Most of them will be school related as that is the only thing I know right now, and the only thing I will know for the rest of the semester!</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Technically this is the second trip to the library this year but this is the first post about it.</p>

<p>Right after I finished my chemistry diploma exam on Thursday, my dad drove me to the library. I felt at home, how sad, haha. Usually I go upstairs to the teen section, but oh ho, not this time! I went straight to the adult comics section. I&rsquo;m quite the rebel, I know. I mostly check to see if they have the last volume of <em>Mushishi</em> by Yuki Urushibara. They never do, but gah, I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>

<p>After that check, I go straight to see if there any books I haven&rsquo;t read in the P and M section to get my fix of Jodi Picoult and Haruki Murakami. Then I quickly scan the bookshelves to see if there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s on my to-read list. After that, I head up to the teens section. I scan the shelves again and then carefully inspect the comic book shelves. I&rsquo;ve pretty much read all the comics I want to read in the section but you never know.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my library list for that day. I&rsquo;m trying to lessen my loads as not to make it so intimidating to get through. And so I can minimalize the amount of books I return unread. I hate doing that&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/series/moon-boy">Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)</a> by Lee Young-You</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve read a some of this series and has been curious ever since then. I saw most of the volumes on the shelves but told myself to only get the first three instead of the first seven.</li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/cirque-du-freak-volume-7/">Cirque du Freak (Volume 7)</a> by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai</strong></p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s not a series I&rsquo;m extremely devoted to, it throws in some variety into my reading.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/perfect-match/">Perfect Match</a> by Jodi Picoult</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on a quest to read every single Jodi Picoult book there is.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/poster-boy/">Poster Boy</a> by Dede Crane</strong></p>

<p>The summary intrigued me, as I&rsquo;m always a sucker for books that deal with illnesses and the such.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Truth About Delilah Blue by Tish Cohen</strong></p>

<p>This has been on my to-read list for a while. I first saw it on display at Wal-Mart. I&rsquo;ve taken it out before but it was returned untouched.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami</strong></p>

<p>Another book I took out but returned it unfinished. I did start it but alas, I ran out of renewals on it. I&rsquo;m a new reader of Murakami&rsquo;s and have only read one of his works but I thoroughly enjoyed it and have heard great reviews for this book.</p></li>
</ul>

        <p>Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&rsquo;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong. I&rsquo;m hoping for the best. But I&rsquo;m still worried! My stomach hurts just thinking about it! Thankfully I don&rsquo;t have to go to school until Tuesday. Even then, it seems like not a long time.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I wrote my chemistry, I went to the library and stayed there for a good hour. I took out eight books. <em>Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)</em> by Lee Young-You, <em>Cirque Du Freak (Volume 7)</em> by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai, <em>Perfect Match</em> by Jodi Picoult, <em>Poster Boy</em> by Dede Crane, <em>The Truth About Delilah Blue</em> by Tish Cohen, and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami. You can read more about why I got those books <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/at-the-library-1/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Later on in the evening, I went to a youth group meeting at my parish. It was my first time there (and the first youth group meeting in a year) but I knew everyone there so I didn&rsquo;t really have to worry about social interactions and such. There was a lot of discussion going on, which was quite enjoyable I think. I&rsquo;m not much of a talker so I just listened. I left with a lot to think about, actually. The theme of that meeting was basically being aware of what&rsquo;s happening in the world. Of course, being young adults, we got off topic quite a couple of times but each topic was just as meaningful as the first. I&rsquo;m hoping to go regularly if time permits.</p>

<p>So, a couple days ago I finally transferred my domains from Go Daddy to Namecheap. Why? Because of the constant complaints I always hear about them, the poor customer service, and of course, SOPA. Yes, I do know that Go Daddy no longer supports SOPA and that SOPA is less likely to exist but the fact that they said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t support SOPA anymore&rdquo; right after Wikipedia and thousands more said they were going to move all of their domains from Go Daddy doesn&rsquo;t make them trustworthy in my eyes. It&rsquo;s quite apparent that they only made that statement because of all of the money and potential customers they lost. Good bye Go Daddy and good riddance!</p>

        <p>Most people&rsquo;s first post of the year is on the first, but no, I&rsquo;m unique and I&rsquo;ll have mine six days later. I&rsquo;ve been busy studying and working on <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">Room 304</a>. I&rsquo;m actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&rsquo;t study at all and now I&rsquo;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had quite a fun day. Firstly, went to Wal-Mart and bought <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> for our shiny new PS3 that we got over Christmas. Actually, I made the choice to buy it and not my brother. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to play that game ever since I had the demo on my iPod. Needless to say, when I got home I was glued to the TV screen and the controller for the rest of the day.</p>

<div align="center">
  <a href="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/448740e3.jpg"><img src="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/448740e3.jpg" alt="Assassin's Creed" width="50%" /></a>
</div>

<p>After that, we went to the library. I love the library. I could spend all day in there if the family weren&rsquo;t rushing every single time we go. I got four books and a CD.</p>

<div align="center">
  <a href="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/01482cc4.jpg"><img src="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/01482cc4.jpg" alt="books" width="50%" /></a>
</div>

<p>I nearly flipped out when I looked at the CD. <em>DIR EN GREY &#8211; DUM SPIRO SPERO</em>. Okay, if you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m a <strong>huge</strong> DIR EN GREY fan. They&rsquo;re a Japanese band so buying their music is really expensive (shipping costs, the horror) so I rarely buy anything of theirs. I&rsquo;ve been waiting to listen to this album for the longest time and I refused to download it anywhere. Now I can listen to it without feeling that guilty, because it&rsquo;s from the library. I&rsquo;m still going to buy it eventually though.</p>

<p>The thing about the library is that it&rsquo;s right next to the mall. Where did we go next? The mall. I don&rsquo;t like shopping for clothes but I need clothes so I had to buy clothes. That part was boring.</p>

<p>Like I said before, we got home and I spent the rest of the day playing <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em>. It&rsquo;s such a good game&hellip; I want the other Assassin&rsquo;s Creed games. Expect they&rsquo;re so expensive! Another time I guess.</p>
