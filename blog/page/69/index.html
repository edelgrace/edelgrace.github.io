<p>Okay, I love Hyde. I always have. There&rsquo;s something about him that I just can&rsquo;t ignore. However, I just wish I could bring back the Roentgen era. Variety is good and experimenting is all well and nice but&hellip; Roentgen. I miss you.</p>

<p>VAMPS was an iffy time for me. I was fully into L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel and obsessing over everything Laruku related. When VAMPS came out with <em>Love Addict</em> I was excited. &ldquo;OMG HYDE HAS A SOLO PROJECT AND THE MUSIC IS SO SEXY OMG.&rdquo; Yeah&hellip;</p>

<p>But at the same time I was disappointed. I found myself saying, &ldquo;What is this noise? Is Hyde going through a mid-life crisis? What is going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought I could brush it off but then my concerns started showing up in Laruku.</p>

<p>Kiss came out.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Kiss was a great album. I like Kiss. There are good songs on there. However, it&rsquo;s just so different. At least, that&rsquo;s what I thought at the time. Looking back on it now, there are some atmospheric tracks on it that I was wanting.</p>

<p>But. It strayed from what I was expecting and I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much.</p>

<p>I want Hyde to go back to the Roentgen days. The songs back then were just so poetic and beautiful and just created an amazing place in my mind whenever I listened to them.</p>

<p>I understand that bands grow and change but I don&rsquo;t want them going in that direction. I&rsquo;d love to see them evolve into more complicated and poetic lyrics with fancy and creative riffs. Not stadium bubblegum pop. I just&hellip; No.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll sit here and listen to forbidden lover on repeat and weep. <strike>Forbidden lover was such a long time ago omg I can&rsquo;t comprehend that.</strike></p>

<p>THIS SONG. THIS SOOOONG. By far one of my favourite Versailles song to exist, ever.</p></li>

<li><p>Bright Red Garden by ViViD</p>

<li><p>Hoshi no Ame by ViViD</p>

<p>My all time favourite song by this band. I love it. And this song live is actually soooo good.</p></li>

<li><p>Trail of Tears by ViViD</p>

<p>Another good song by ViViD. Kinda similar to Hoshi no Ame but not really.</p></li>

<li><p>Be Strong by Yazumi Kana</p>

<p>A feel good, let&rsquo;s pump up kind of song. Heard from the PSP.</p></li>

<li><p>Mister (Japanese cover) by Zessei Bijin!</p>

<p>This group is an online YouTube cover group. They specialize in super cute girl groups. This song is just soooo cute. I love the chorus. Catchy. And every time I watch the music video. Those dance moves. I am entranced by Kana&rsquo;s hips. Also. Tonkhai totally shines in this song. Love it!</p></li>

<li><p>Scream (cover) by Zessei Bijin!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s such a shame, a lot of their songs don&rsquo;t start out that great but get better as it goes on. Hence all the dislikes on this song. I love Tonkhai&rsquo;s CL part. A bit low though. The opposite of a falsetto? Hehe. Beibei stole the show though. Almost better than the original. <strike>If only Minnie sang on tune a bit more but her voice is cute so it&rsquo;s forgivable.</strike></p></li>

<li><p>Ugly (Japanese cover) by Zessei Bijin!</p>

<p>Another song that doesn&rsquo;t start that great. But the rest of the parts are perfect. Perfect. Beibei nails it. The chorus is okay though. Someone&rsquo;s releases are annoying.</p></li>

<li><p>Scream by 2NE1</p>

<p>The real deal. THE REEEAL DEAL. I love Minzy&rsquo;s rapping. Pretty dece. And CL. GUURL stop being so attractive. My only qualm about this song is Dara&rsquo;s part. It&rsquo;s a bit weird and out of place. :/ I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it. But she sings it well just&hellip; Yeah. Bom&rsquo;s part. Bom I love you. I love youuu. Also. Girl crush on Minzy. She&rsquo;s so attractive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fave musician(s) atm</strong>: 2NE1 &amp; BIGBANG</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a coincidence, the song just came up on my iPod. Anyway, a couple days ago I finally decided that I would watch BIGBANG&rsquo;s new music video, MONSTER. I must admit, lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to more and more K-pop these days. I&rsquo;m just craving <strike>more new DIR EN GREY, however they are not inhuman and can&rsquo;t churn out albums out of their asses every day of the year.</strike> new music to listen to and K-pop is new to me so there we go. Also, I have a thing for GD and Seungri, shhh.</p>

<p>Anyway, so my thoughts on the music video.</p>

<p>The beginning actually pretty cool. The prison and the gun shots and the explosions was just so epic. I enjoyed the point of view shots. For some reason I was disappointed that it wasn&rsquo;t the view of actual monster but the band members. Although at the same time, I was just like ASDFGJKL BEAUTIFUL METAPHOR.</p>

<p>So the piano kicks in and my heart starts melting. It&rsquo;s just so melancholy and BEAUTIFULLL. Then I hear TOP&rsquo;s deep lull of a voice and I melt even more. And then I hear GD and I scream inside. But then Taeyang shows up and I&rsquo;m like, WHAT&rsquo;S UP WITH YOUR HAIR?</p>

<p>Seriously, I could not get over Taeyang&rsquo;s hair for most of the music video. It&rsquo;s just so ridiculous like&hellip; I just can&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t even know how to describe it. That&rsquo;s how out of this world it is. It&rsquo;s like he stepped out of a cheesy anime. I just couldn&rsquo;t take it seriously.</p>

<p>I just started and ended that last paragraph with seriously. Wow.</p>

<p>The chorus was pretty good. Considering what I can understand from it. And then Seungri&rsquo;s part. IDGI. Why does Seungri have two lines in every single?! Fantastic Baby. Bad Boy. Lollipop. Everything except Blue, where he sings the chorus (right? I don&rsquo;t even know sorry Seungri). Anyway, another post on why I love Seungri will be coming soon.</p>

<p>Despite all the crazy effects, real life anime GD kicking a statue, Daesung&rsquo;s metal booger, Taeyang&rsquo;s wtf hair, TOP&rsquo;s overall sexiness, and Seungri&rsquo;s two liner, I would say that the most memorable part of the music video is the end.</p>

<p>In the end, GD walks out of a bunker and it&rsquo;s snowing. He&rsquo;s looking around, looking like number 3 from Kids Next Door with his blonde mushroom hair. But then there&rsquo;s these beautiful strings that just pass through your ears and into your heart and the painful gut twisting lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m sick. I think I&rsquo;m sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every time I listen to this song, I&rsquo;m always waiting for the end. Ugh, too good.</p>

        </div>

        <p>I meant to post last on the 15th but I just couldn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I should blog. It just didn&rsquo;t feel right to do so. Even now, I&rsquo;m not so comfortable posting this but I just need to get it out, which is why it&rsquo;s private. Only three people have the password to my private posts so I guess it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>

<p>On the 15th I received a text from a friend asking about our mutual friend, T.</p>

<p>T&rsquo;s one of my closest guy friends whom I affectionly call Muffin. We went to the same junior high together and we both excelled at the extreme sport of procrastination. I told Muffin everything about life. I trusted him with all my secrets. However, within the past year I haven&rsquo;t really talked to him that much. We&rsquo;d see each other in the halls and say a quick &ldquo;Hi how are you?&rdquo; and go on to our classes. Sometimes there was a hug. Him ruffling my hair. Poking each others sides. The usual friendship shenanigans.</p>

<p>So my friend asked if I had talked to Muffin lately and to check his Facebook page. I said no and proceeded to look at his wall on Facebook. There was a single post that I saw right away. It was a RIP message from his sister. At first I couldn&rsquo;t really believe it. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s a practical joke or something.&rdquo; But as people started commenting and more wall posts began to appear, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t a joke. Somehow, I had a small shred of hope that maybe, just maybe, it was a joke after all.</p>

<p>Still, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep right away that night. I cried and prayed that this wasn&rsquo;t real. When I walked into the band room for practice this morning, I felt like throwing up. His sister, M, is in band and plays the flute, just like me. She&rsquo;s the sweetest girl I know and she&rsquo;s always smiling. So when I saw her crying, I was filled with dread. It wasn&rsquo;t a joke. T&rsquo;s really gone.</p>

<p>Me and my friend A didn&rsquo;t say anything but we went over and hugged her. I tried to keep myself from crying because it would just be selfish of me. It was so hard, especially when M started shaking in my arms as she sobbed. The only thought in my head was, &ldquo;T, why did you leave her behind, this sweet little girl who just loves you to death? What happened to make you leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, I didn&rsquo;t really know what happened exactly but I had a vague feeling. I still don&rsquo;t like to say it because it just makes me shiver all over.</p>

<p>First period comes and goes and then it&rsquo;s time for second period. While my teacher was explaining every single meaning of every single sentence and word and punctuation mark of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, another teacher walks in and gives her a sheet of paper. A troubled looked crossed over my teacher&rsquo;s face and she sighed. I clenched my jaw and buried my head into my book.</p>

<p>Half an hour passes and my principal&rsquo;s voice comes onto the intercom, &ldquo;Please excuse this interruption. Teachers please read out the handout you just received. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We learned that over the weekend that T.W. passed away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ground my teeth so that my mouth wouldn&rsquo;t wobble or let out a cry. It was official. Really official this time. I spent the rest of the period trying not to cry. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that Muffin was gone.</p>

<p>After that the week went well actually. I tried not to think about it during the day, and it worked. I said my prayers for him every night.</p>

<p>Friday was the funeral.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to a funeral so I was scared. I was bit late but I managed to see two of my friends who I stood next to the whole time. It was crowded. I kind of expected it. Muffin has a lot friends. He was just so outgoing and cheerful and kind that all kinds of people flocked to him. So we literally stood a few inches away from the entrance where tons of over people where standing as well for the whole time.</p>

<p>Muffin&rsquo;s friend, appropriately nicknamed Cupcake, made a speech. It was wonderful. So many memories flooded into my mind at the time. I giggled at some of the hilarious teenage shenanigans and cried at the parts when it seemed like Cupcake couldn&rsquo;t hold it together. But he did and I never felt so proud for him. This is cheesy, but I was filled with love for some reason.</p>

<p>As it came to a close, I had a sudden urge to see his face. One last time. But I was in the back and I couldn&rsquo;t make it to see him in time. Maybe it was better if I didn&rsquo;t. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have handled it.</p>

<p>When they brought out the coffin, all the emotions I held in that past week burst out of me. I sobbed into my friend&rsquo;s shoulder as I watched as his best friend since the age of seven carried the coffin into the hearse. As I watched as his father quietly sobbed in his arm as the other men held him. As I saw his sister turn her head away and cry out loud. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Was that really Muffin in that coffin? What was his expression? And as silly as this sounds, was it really him? I was filled with immense sorrow and anger at that moment. Anger at myself, anger at him, anger towards whatever had caused this&hellip; I still kind of am but now it&rsquo;s considerably less.</p>

<p>After the hearse drove away, I made me way to say my condolences. All I could say was &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while&rdquo; and I hugged Cupcake for the longest time. I suddenly realized how long it was since I talked to him and how long it was since I told anyone any of my secrets. Then I went to hug Muffin&rsquo;s sister. It was a quick one. I don&rsquo;t know her that well. She looked at me and with the bravest and strongest face I have ever seen she said, &ldquo;If you want anything of Tai&rsquo;s, let me know.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s another topic entirely.</p>

<p>I lingered around. Hugged. Cried. Said good byes. I left feeling better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit unsettled. The halls seem emptier. I miss him. But little by little, I&rsquo;m getting used to it. I&rsquo;m not sure about his family though, especially his sister. They must have it so hard. I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine it. For now, I&rsquo;m going to pray for him and his family. I hope he can hear my prayers.</p>

        <p>Lent is over. I haven&rsquo;t visited Room 304 or Goodreads in over 40 days. Geez, I have a lot of catching up to do. I did read over those 40 days but definitely not a lot. I&rsquo;ve been swamped with school work and going to sleep at midnight every night doesn&rsquo;t leave much time for reading.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve resorted to audiobooks. Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;lazy way of reading&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve been craving some sort of world that I can delve into and just absorb. Lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to audiobooks while doing homework or when I have a free period in class. Somehow I can manage listening perfectly to an audiobook and manage to do calculus questions (and get them right) at the same time.</p>

<p>So far my favourite audiobook is <em>Seriously&hellip; I&rsquo;m Kidding</em> written and narrated by Ellen Degeneres. Usually I&rsquo;m quite weary about celebrities writing books but whew, this one was just so entertaining! Yeah, it&rsquo;s full of laughs but what else do you expect from a comedian? Ellen is just a ball of excitement and fun. Plus, hearing her narrate her own words really made it lively. However, I do want to read the printed version some time soon.</p>

<p>But yeah, I have quite a lot of catching up to do. I wasted my whole Easter Break trying to do homework and I&rsquo;m kicking my butt over it. I said I would do my homework in two days so I can have free time for the rest of the week but that didn&rsquo;t happen. So now I have 130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, couple of questions of calculus, a chapter&rsquo;s worth work of physics, and a workbook in social to do.</p>

<p>After I do all that, hopefully I can update my reading list. Here&rsquo;s what I have so far:</p>

<p>Dec 12 2011 &#8211; Started Tomodachi</p>

<p>Dec 23 2011 &#8211; Finished Akuma 2</p>

<p>Dec 26 2011 &#8211; Finished</p>

<p>Dec 26 2011 &#8211; Finished Akuma 8 (?)</p>

<p>Dec 27 2011 &#8211; Started</p>
