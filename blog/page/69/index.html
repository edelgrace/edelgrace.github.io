        <p>This morning was a great morning! Most band practices aren&rsquo;t that exciting but this one was pretty good. We played the opener and the second song of the show. In marching band, the members run around a football field making pretty shapes while playing their instruments. Those 11 minutes of organized chaos is what we call a show. At my highschool we have a marching band. I&rsquo;m in band but I don&rsquo;t march because of money and time issues. Back to the point. We played the first two songs of the show. It was absolutely beautiful.</p>

<p>The first song has a wonderful melody. It&rsquo;s a version of some song that&rsquo;s commonly played at weddings (not the wedding march, haha) but the name escapes me at the moment. At the beginning, we play these chords and WOW do we play it good. I got goosebumps, no joke. The crescendos were just so impressive. It was one of those you had to be there moments.</p>

<p>The second song is completely different from the first. It was fast, chaotic, and full of disorder. I love it. The contrast was startling but it was just so musical. After playing for a bit, our band instructor started describing what they would be doing on the field during the songs. I&rsquo;m not even marching the show but I was extremely excited for some reason. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how the show will turn out in the summer.</p>

<p>I wrote a physics test on Tuesday. A miracle must have happened because I got my test back today and I got an 85% on it. I was sure I failed because I did not have any confidence at all while writing it. I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m not writing the final exam for physics 20.</p>

<p>This weekend, I plan to study for all my subjects. Today is my lazy day because I believe everyone deserves a lazy day.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is finally December!</p>

<p>The first day of December was okay. In math I got my last unit test back. 91%! But then I got my quiz back. 64%! My marks have such variety, don&rsquo;t they? I felt like my math teacher was giving me disappointed looks all through class because I did so bad on this quiz. This unit we&rsquo;re doing, permutations and combinations, is really weird for me. I get the answers right in my homework but I&rsquo;m not getting it. I understand what to do but I just don&rsquo;t get it. I&rsquo;m not used to thinking like this. It&rsquo;s stuff like probablity. I was never good at probablity. I prefer formulas that are concrete and don&rsquo;t require much thinking. Ugh, I hate this unit. I said that to my friend with such force and venom in my voice, I think I scared him or made him think I was a freak. Well, I&rsquo;ll just do super amazing on the unit test and then my math teacher will replace the mark. But I hate looking at that 64%&hellip;</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much about today except for the math thing, haha. In spare I just do homework, physics is such a bore, and chemistry isn&rsquo;t something where many exciting things happen. Actually, that last bit was a lie. My chemistry teacher has such a sweet personality. Her jokes are plentiful. Although it&rsquo;s not enough to energize me and keep me awake. I&rsquo;ve never fallen asleep in any class but I&rsquo;ve been close to, especially last period (which is chemistry for this semester).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no drama right now, which is always a plus. Although my friend&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend is getting deported back to his home country (which is the reason why they broke up) which is dramatic but not really. It&rsquo;s quite saddening because they were such a cute couple.</p>

<p>Oh, and I must mention that I opened my very first fanlisting!</p>

<p>If you are a fan of index cards, please don&rsquo;t hesistate to join. ^^ I also applied for a Yukihiro Awaji fanlisting today. I love him so much, he&rsquo;s one of my favourite musicians! Forever my bias.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s all for today. I am once again trying to post as much as I can. I predict many posts with little to no comments as I don&rsquo;t have enough time for blogwalking but I will reply to any comments I receive asap. :D</p>

        <p>Last Wednesday, the marching band (with a few concert bandies) hosted a workshop for the junior highs in the Catholic School District. It was mostly a ploy to get junior high kids to join marching band if and/or when they come to our school. Sadly, concert band wasn&rsquo;t emphasized in any way (I&rsquo;m part of concert and apparently I&rsquo;m inferior to marching band kids HAH I beg to differ). It was fun regardless. There was over 300 kids in total. At the end of the workshop, we all played together as one mass band. It was loud. My little brother is in junior high right now and he went to the invitational. I was so proud to see him play and such. I dote on him too much but I can&rsquo;t help it.</p>

<p>Wow, tomorrow is December! I actually can&rsquo;t believe it. Over the weekend we put up the Christmas tree. I&rsquo;m ready for a nice long break (<strike>that will be spent studying orz</strike>)! My birthday is in 31 days, not including today. The only bad thing about having a birthday near the end of the year is that you&rsquo;re one of the youngest people in your grade. One of my friends in my grade is already 19 (when she moved to Canada from the Philippines, she went down a grade because of language problems but still). And Christmas is in 25 days. To be honest, I&rsquo;m mostly excited to do the Advent Calendar on Neopets, haha.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to sign off. It may only be 10 PM but I am dead tired.</p>

        <h4>Nov 22, 2011 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/it-smells-like-highschool/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Last week we got our yearbooks from last year. I dislike the fact that they give it out in the new school year since not all of those who graduated can come back and sign the yearbooks of those who were left behind. But I guess it takes a while to get all of the pictures, design each of the pages, send it to the company, physically make it, and then ship it back to us. Still, I wish they give it earlier.</p>

<p>Anyway, my TA (my homeroom teacher) were giving out the yearbooks and she smelled each one of them saying, &ldquo;It smells like highschool.&rdquo; When a couple of us laughed at her, she said, &ldquo;No really! Ten years later from now, you&rsquo;ll take it off your shelf, and think that it smells like high school.&rdquo; Not many of us were convinced.</p>

<p>Does high school have a smell? When I think about it, the only smell I can think of is the jock hallway smell. Sweat and stinky uniforms. Yuck. I know people in high school who have a distinct smell but it doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone smells like that. I don&rsquo;t even know. Did your high school have a distinct smell?</p>

<p>On another note, diplomas are coming up soon. Okay, in 63 days, but I&rsquo;m going to start studying now. I think the Alberta government basically screws us over with the diplomas. We&rsquo;re one of the only provinces in the country who have diplomas and if a province does have diplomas, it&rsquo;s not worth 50% of their mark like ours.</p>

<p>Some people in the government try to justify it by saying it forces kids to study. There are people who never study at all and do great. There are people who study their butts off for weeks and don&rsquo;t pass. It doesn&rsquo;t help us at all. It&rsquo;s too much stress, especially since it contributes to the marks that universities and colleges look at. Not all universities in the world acknowledge the fact that we have diplomas that can seriously skew our marks (except for Saskatchewan but who wants to go there?). I think it&rsquo;s good to have high expectations but sometimes it&rsquo;s too high for most people to achieve.</p>

<p>As you can tell, I really hate diplomas.</p>

        <p>I never finished the DIR EN GREY meme. I’ll finish it sooner or later. I haven’t posted in a while either. Oh no! Well, better late than never.</p>

<p>I rediscovered this podcast I downloaded when I just started listening to Japanese and Korean music. All Rock and No Talk by xxthrowdownxx I think it was. So yeah, I was listening to volume 12 and came across a pleasant gem.</p>

<p><em>Stand By Me</em> by The Brilliant Green. The Brilliant Green is a pop rock band fronted by Tomoko Kawase. Tomoko Kawase is most known for (or so I would think) her solo project, Tommy February6 or Tommy Heavenly6.</p>

<p>The first time I listened to her would either be in the Nana OST or in the podcast all those years ago.</p>

<p>When I was in love with L’Arc~en~Ciel, I used to go on a forum called Dive to Blue. There they shared many music and this one album featured Tetsu69, the bassist of the band. This album was a Nana tribute. Also on the album was Skye Sweetman and Tommy February6. I don’t remember what song Tommy sang. <em>Hey Bad Boy</em>? Or was that the song on the podcast? I’ll have to check. Either way, that was my first song by her.</p>

<p>Just recently, I rediscovered her though the anime <em>Paradise Kiss</em> (from the creator of <em>Nana</em>). She sang the opening which was <em>Lonely in Gorgeous</em>. The song ran shivers down my spine. It was sultry, catchy, reminiscent of 80s pop, and the lyrics were practically made for the anime. Yeah, I listened to that for a long while.</p>

<p>But I <strong>rere</strong>discovered her like yesterday or so through the podcast. The Brilliant Green. The song <em>Stand By Me</em> is amazing. Tomoko’s voice is absolutely heavenly. It’s so pure. I love it.</p>

<p>So I searched for more Tomoko. <em>Magic in Your Eyes</em> was the one that stood out the most from my findings. I’ve listened to it before but it never stuck to me until now. The very first few seconds aren’t that amazing but filled with wonderful Engrish. “Come on darling close your eyes.” The bridge or chorus isn’t that great either. “Call in, if you’re my boyfriend x1000.” But the verses were absolutely HEAVENLY.</p>
