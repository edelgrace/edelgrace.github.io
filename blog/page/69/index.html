        <p>Yesterday was my birthday. Yay birthdays! I&rsquo;m now the golden age of 17 (this means I have to change all my ages on my websites, ack)! I kinda don&rsquo;t feel any different (no one ever does, am I right?), not to mention that 17 is a weird number. I guess it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s odd. But 21 and 23 aren&rsquo;t that weird of numbers either. I guess 17 is weird because it&rsquo;s that age that&rsquo;s in between. I&rsquo;m a teen but almost a legal adult. Oh, that&rsquo;s a scary thought.</p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday was a great day! It&rsquo;s far from one of the best birthdays ever but it was still loads of fun.</p>

<p>In the morning we woke up extra early to go to the weekday mass as church. After mass Father made the congregation sing happy birthday to me. It was embarrassing. Like, what do you do other than stand there awkwardly with a ridiculous grin on your face while people sing to you? I sure don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>After that we went home for a bit and then headed out for the mall. I invited a couple of friends for lunch and a movie. We watched the new Sherlock Holmes movie. I wanted to watch The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo but it&rsquo;s 18A. One of my frieds is already 18 so she could have bought the tickets for us but I didn&rsquo;t want her to. Good thing though because Sherlock Holmes is a great movie! Oh goodness, I loved it so much. Maybe even more than the first one. It had just the right mix of action, comedy, and wonderful deductions. Although I would have liked Sherlock to deduce more as he spent more screen time punching people or shooting a gun. Still, his antics were just golden.</p>

<p>I went home after the movie and fell asleep on my brother as he played on his shiny new PS3 since I was tired. I drooled a bit, haha. Then I was rudely awoken by him when our first visitors rang the doorbell. As more people came we started to eat. It was yummy dinner. Classic Filipino dishes and spaghetti. Although the spaghetti was quite dry, but shh, don&rsquo;t tell my mom that.</p>

<p>Overall it was a great day. I still can&rsquo;t get over the movie though. It&rsquo;s like when I watched Inception. Yeah, Inception. Don&rsquo;t judge me, I love that movie.</p>

        <p>Yesterday was my last day of school. It was pretty pointless as it was a half day and each class was half an hour long. We also had band practice in the morning! Thankfully it was cut short because the band teachers had to go carol with the other teachers at the front of the school. They actually sounded pretty good. I was expecting horrible off key belting and such but no. I&rsquo;m guessing they just picked the teachers who can actually sing well. Yes, I thought it was a reasonably good start for the day.</p>

<p>Then I had spare which, frankly, was extremely boring. Math was a bit better. We played &ldquo;Mind Trap&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s basically riddles and such. When I was in grade ten, I got some Mind Trap riddle cards from my Secret Santa at band. My favourite one was &ldquo;If A&rsquo;s peacock laid an egg in B&rsquo;s backyard in Philadelphia in 1932 during the Great Depression, who would be the rightful owner of the egg?&rdquo; The answer is the peahen because peacocks are males and can&rsquo;t lay eggs. Yeah, I know, weird. I love riddles like those but sometimes the answers are just make me want to scream, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My second highlight of the day was watching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters">Mythbusters</a> Christmas special. I love the Mythbusters. They&rsquo;re like Bill Nye the Science Guy but on steroids. The Christmas special was actually pretty cool. Adam and Jamie made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldberg Machine</a> out of Christmas objects and such. And then Kari, Grant, and Tory were seeing if (accidentally) dropping frozen turkeys on your pets could be lethal. Ah, &lsquo;twas a good episode.</p>

<p>I think this will be my last post of the year as my holidays will be extremely busy. Family outings, studying for exams, working on my websites, vegging out, etc etc. Typical holidays, haha. Have a great Christmas everyone! Take care and be safe!</p>

<p>EDIT [DEC 25, 2011]</p>

<p>Merry Christmas everybody! Christmas day was a good day. I got a new iPod Touch because mine broke recently. I&rsquo;m seriously super thankful. It&rsquo;s so pretty and shiny and (eek) expensive. That means more blog posts, more procrastination, and more caution, yes?</p>

<p>Today we went to the early morning mass. We had to altarserve for the mass. There was only 3 of us! I think we pulled it off nicely though. Unlike last night where I made a billon mistakes. Ugh, that was kind of embarassing. The priest even got super mad at me. Opps. My parents thought it was a nice mass though. Haha, sure.</p>

<p>Well, the end of the year draws near. I&rsquo;m starting my studying tomorrow. Doing nothing for the last three days only makes me more stressed. Merry Christmas again!</p>

        <p>Whoot~ I got 94% on my chem test! However, I wrote a physics test today and I just know that didn&rsquo;t go very well. I have a math test tomorrow so as soon as I finish writing this post, I&rsquo;m going to go study.</p>

<p>Last year around this time, I set a goal for myself: read 100 books before 2011 ends. I&rsquo;m an avid manga reader and I can finish one volume of manga in an hour so a week into the challenge I found that I was already a quarter of the way through the challenge (keep in mind this was during winter break, haha). So I increased my goal to 500 books. That went along nicely&hellip; Until summer came. During the summer, I read very little. Maybe 5 physical books at the most. It&rsquo;s now December and I&rsquo;ve only read 348 books out of the 500 books. I really want to accomplish my goal but that&rsquo;s impossible if I want to actually study over the winter holidays because well, my future depends on it. I&rsquo;m thinking to change my goal to 400+ books but it feels like I would be cheating the challenge. I am very tempted to do it&hellip;</p>

<p>I took part in many other book challenges this year as well. Such as a colour coded challenge (reading a book with every colour of the rainbow in the title), manga challenge (I exceeded my goal of 100, of course), 1st in a series challenge (I&rsquo;ve read 10 out of my goal of 20 since I last updated it), and off the shelf (read 30 books that you have but haven&rsquo;t touched, I&rsquo;ve only gotten 7 out of 30 although there are some books which I no longer own on that list).</p>

<p>What are the most memorable books of the year so far? Easy peasy!</p>

        This manga series is incomplete but I've ready everything that is currently available to English readers. It is full of angst. To those who don't like angst, it may seem like it's unnecessarily angsty but I beg to differ. There can never be too much angst! It's not so much like your typical love story. The characters are extremely hard headed and you never know what they might do. There's always surprises about them that keeps you guessing and wanting to know more. Yeah, I stayed up until 3 in the morning reading this and bawling my eyes out (quietly though as not to wake the parents). </td> </tr> </table>

      &lt;strong&gt;Everything I have read by Ai Yazawa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have ranted on too much about Ai Yazawa's amazing skills as a mangaka (comic book artist). If you really want to read it, you can see it &lt;a href=&quot;http://room304.brokenphrases.info/updates/2011/06/i-have-an-ai-yazawa-addiction/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

          &lt;strong&gt;Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men takes us into the lives of George and Lennie, two farm workers set out to find their way to a new life. In true Steinbeck form, this short novel explores both loyalty and the transient nature of mankind. (Summary from &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodreads.com&quot;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

          &lt;p&gt;
            I read this book for English and I loved it. I read a review for the book once and the reader said, &quot;This book made me realize that the human mind's need for companionship is frighteningly scary&quot; or something along those lines. I agree wholeheartedly. To those who have not read this book (it's short and not that time consuming!), I highly recommend you read it. &lt;/td&gt;

        <p>This morning was a great morning! Most band practices aren&rsquo;t that exciting but this one was pretty good. We played the opener and the second song of the show. In marching band, the members run around a football field making pretty shapes while playing their instruments. Those 11 minutes of organized chaos is what we call a show. At my highschool we have a marching band. I&rsquo;m in band but I don&rsquo;t march because of money and time issues. Back to the point. We played the first two songs of the show. It was absolutely beautiful.</p>

<p>The first song has a wonderful melody. It&rsquo;s a version of some song that&rsquo;s commonly played at weddings (not the wedding march, haha) but the name escapes me at the moment. At the beginning, we play these chords and WOW do we play it good. I got goosebumps, no joke. The crescendos were just so impressive. It was one of those you had to be there moments.</p>

<p>The second song is completely different from the first. It was fast, chaotic, and full of disorder. I love it. The contrast was startling but it was just so musical. After playing for a bit, our band instructor started describing what they would be doing on the field during the songs. I&rsquo;m not even marching the show but I was extremely excited for some reason. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how the show will turn out in the summer.</p>

<p>I wrote a physics test on Tuesday. A miracle must have happened because I got my test back today and I got an 85% on it. I was sure I failed because I did not have any confidence at all while writing it. I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m not writing the final exam for physics 20.</p>

<p>This weekend, I plan to study for all my subjects. Today is my lazy day because I believe everyone deserves a lazy day.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is finally December!</p>

<p>The first day of December was okay. In math I got my last unit test back. 91%! But then I got my quiz back. 64%! My marks have such variety, don&rsquo;t they? I felt like my math teacher was giving me disappointed looks all through class because I did so bad on this quiz. This unit we&rsquo;re doing, permutations and combinations, is really weird for me. I get the answers right in my homework but I&rsquo;m not getting it. I understand what to do but I just don&rsquo;t get it. I&rsquo;m not used to thinking like this. It&rsquo;s stuff like probablity. I was never good at probablity. I prefer formulas that are concrete and don&rsquo;t require much thinking. Ugh, I hate this unit. I said that to my friend with such force and venom in my voice, I think I scared him or made him think I was a freak. Well, I&rsquo;ll just do super amazing on the unit test and then my math teacher will replace the mark. But I hate looking at that 64%&hellip;</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much about today except for the math thing, haha. In spare I just do homework, physics is such a bore, and chemistry isn&rsquo;t something where many exciting things happen. Actually, that last bit was a lie. My chemistry teacher has such a sweet personality. Her jokes are plentiful. Although it&rsquo;s not enough to energize me and keep me awake. I&rsquo;ve never fallen asleep in any class but I&rsquo;ve been close to, especially last period (which is chemistry for this semester).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no drama right now, which is always a plus. Although my friend&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend is getting deported back to his home country (which is the reason why they broke up) which is dramatic but not really. It&rsquo;s quite saddening because they were such a cute couple.</p>

<p>Oh, and I must mention that I opened my very first fanlisting!</p>

<p>If you are a fan of index cards, please don&rsquo;t hesistate to join. ^^ I also applied for a Yukihiro Awaji fanlisting today. I love him so much, he&rsquo;s one of my favourite musicians! Forever my bias.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s all for today. I am once again trying to post as much as I can. I predict many posts with little to no comments as I don&rsquo;t have enough time for blogwalking but I will reply to any comments I receive asap. :D</p>
