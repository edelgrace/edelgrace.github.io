<blockquote>
<p>How do you organize your blog in terms of what is in your side bar? Do you have categories and defined sections in your side bar?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the moment, my side bar is laid out by links to my favourite bloggers, categories, monthly archives, and recent comments. I don&rsquo;t like to clutter my side bar with too much, especially images, so it&rsquo;s mostly all text. I love minimalist designs.</p>

        <p>Since I recently took up crochet, I have also been itching to start learning how to knit as well. I figure it would be advantageous to take up both of the more well known fiber art hobbies. So I signed up for lessons at one of my local yarn stores.</p>

<p>The store itself is very cozy and quaint. It&rsquo;s literally a small house filled to the brim with yarn. The people at the front desk are extremely nice and while I was waiting for class to start, they offered me some tea.</p>

<p>The classes take place in the basement which can be hard for people who have trouble going up or down stairs. However, the room is small and cozy (looks like it could fit five or six people at most) and a perfectly intimate setting for holding a class for knitting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they are moving locations this summer so who knows (I don&rsquo;t) what the new store will look like. Hopefully it still retains it&rsquo;s small store charm.</p>

<p>The instructor Brenda, was incredibly patient and extremely knowledgeable. She goes through teaching us like a breeze. Her instructions were easy to follow however I am a total hands-on learner. I need to do it with someone coaching me and as soon as I see it happen, I can get it!</p>

<p>The style of knitting that Brenda taught us was English style. I had never known there were different styles of knitting. I was a little surprised at how much arms are involved but I have taken a look at some YouTube videos of English style knitters and some have perfected the style to a tee without the large arm movements. I&rsquo;m still learning!</p>

<p>In the class we are working towards making a ribbed cowl with Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick yarn. I chose the Blossom colour as it was fairly light and according to Brenda, it would look great on me with my skin tone.</p>

<p>So far, the pattern starts with a 16 loop cast on and alternating knit and purl stitches. Here are the first few rows on my first attempt.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve actually started and restarted several times since because I&rsquo;m a huge perfectionist. However feel like I&rsquo;m slowly getting the hang of it now. I can&rsquo;t wait until I finish up my very first knitted FO!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To many readers, who have perhaps known Frankenstein only at second hand, the original may well come as a surprise. When Mary Shelley began it, she was only eighteen, though she was already Shelley&rsquo;s mistress and Byron&rsquo;s friend. In her preface she explains how she and Shelley spent part of a wet summer with Byron in Switzerland, amusing themselves by reading and writing ghost stories. Her contribution was Frankenstein, a story about a student of natural philosophy who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from bones he has collected in charnel-houses. The story is not a study of the macabre, as such, but rather a study of how man uses his power, through science, to manipulate and pervert his own destiny, and this makes it a profoundly disturbing book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shelley is a lot like her mother. They both love characters who talk and talk and talk.</p>

<p>Honestly, I did not expect most of what happened in this book. Everyone &ldquo;knows&rdquo; the Frankenstein story: mad scientist raises the undead in a creepy laboratory in the mountains during a thunderstorm. It usually seems to end there. Some variations, Frankenstein actually makes a &ldquo;female&rdquo; version and, usually, the female doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with its male counterpart.</p>

<p>However, I learned that Frankenstein is much more than that. It&rsquo;s a lot more gruesome and morbid than I thought it would be. I wouldn&rsquo;t really classify it as horrifying in any way. Honestly, I was a bit bored by many parts of it. I sympathized with Frankenstein&rsquo;s creation when he told his tale but it was still hard for me to picture him as anything but human.</p>

<p>I will say that I enjoyed how Shelley utilized the unreliable narrator. I can&rsquo;t believe sitting down with someone while they recounted a story as long as this.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I read it and got it out of the way but I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the book itself. I don&rsquo;t want to say &ldquo;it was okay&rdquo; AKA 2 stars because that implies there was something good about the book. Not to say there&rsquo;s anything bad but it just wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p>

        <p>I tried to cook more during the month of May. Partly because my mother was out of the country and then cooking was left to us but also because I&rsquo;m trying my best to learn how to cook. Unfortunately, most of what I cooked was pretty simple but I still managed to cook some things. I didn&rsquo;t take pictures of everything I cooked, although I totally should have.</p>

<p><strong>Honey Garlic Chicken Wings</strong></p>

<p><em>I tried so hard and got so far but in the end, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</em></p>

<p>Jokes aside, I put a lot of time into making these chicken wings. I floured them, fried them, made the sauce, and cooked them again. It tasted horrible. My brother reassured me they were tasty and he ate most of them but I know a good honey garlic wing when I taste one. The sugar got burnt and I put way too much soy sauce. Oh well, you can&rsquo;t win all the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WIN_20170508_17_05_59_Pro.png?resize=537%2C419" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><strong>Mac and Cheese from scratch</strong></p>

<p>I had tried to make mac and cheese from scratch once before. It was not great. This time around, it was absolutely delicious! We used Swiss cheese which wasn&rsquo;t ideal (my brother is on a low sodium diet) but it still tasted great. The cheese turned out nice and creamy as well. Would definitely make again!</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170507_122718.jpg?resize=663%2C373" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p><strong>Chili Wrap</strong></p>

<p>I made chili and wrapped it up in a tortilla. Not a lot of brain power needed for this little meal but I was pleased with the results. I may have under-cooked the beans a bit. Next time I know I need to cook them for longer!</p>

<p>If you could have lunch with any living authors and/or book bloggers, who would you choose and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh man, the living restriction is a tough one. If language wasn&rsquo;t a barrier, I would definitely have lunch with Haruki Murakami. Although I have mixed feelings on his work, I feel like it would be pretty nice to sit down with him and chat over a cup of tea overlooking Tokyo (I&rsquo;m assuming he lives in Tokyo) in some little cafe. I&rsquo;d probably just let him talk about his views on life, his running, his portrayal of women in his novels, and so on.</p>

<p>If language is a barrier, I just might have to sit down and have a chat with Lucy Kinsley. If you are unfamiliar with Lucy, she is an artist with a couple of graphic novels under her belt. I will admit I have a little admiration crush on Lucy. She seems like a fun-loving quirky woman and she would probably know the best hidden place to have lunch at.</p>
