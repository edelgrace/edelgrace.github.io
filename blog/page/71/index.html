<p>I love WordPress. It&rsquo;s the best content management system for me and extremely flexible. Anything is possible in WordPress. However, lately I&rsquo;ve been noticing a lack in the number of blogs from undergrads and grads alike. I searched high and low on WordpPess, Blogger, etc. Then I remembered: Tumblr. Not surprisingly, the student blogging community is thriving on Tumblr. <span id="more-271"></span></p>

<p>Tumblr is less of a blogging platform, but more of a social media website. I can see why younger people prefer blogging on Tumblr rather than more complex platforms like WordPress. Upon browsing the librarian community on Tumblr, I was dumbstruck. So this is where all of the blogging librarians, potential librarians, and library lovers hang out!</p>

<p>Although I do love Tumblr, I was disappointed. I already spend enough time on Tumblr as it is! I&rsquo;ve been tracking my website usage since December and at one point <a href="http://brokenphrases.info/procrastination-nation/">I spent almost 12 hours on Tumblr in a week</a>. I&rsquo;ve been making progress since then, but I don&rsquo;t want to back to my Tumblr time sucking days.</p>

<p>While trying to find a way to sync the blogs I follow on Tumblr to my Google Reader account (the answer is <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, by the way), I had another revelation: I can post my WordPress posts to Tumblr automatically! Yeah, it kinda sucks out the interactivity with the community but it&rsquo;s the closest I can get without the temptation of spending 4 hours on Tumblr.</p>

<p>But I am faced with another dilemma: I need to post way more. The heart of Tumblr is reblogging. It&rsquo;s so easy to reblog as many things as you want in a short period of time. Content sharers are able to produce more posts than content creators, unless you are both of course. It&rsquo;s also a really personal medium as well (I&rsquo;ve read many TMI posts about, uh, womanly issues on Tumblr). I want approach The Librarian Code more professionally, so don&rsquo;t expect any TMI posts from me.</p>

<p>So yes, I have made the almost switch to Tumblr. Expect more from me, hopefully. :)</p>

<p>I have a hard time reading textbooks. I can&rsquo;t read blocks of text. Yes, regular old books are blocks of text but textbooks aren&rsquo;t meant to be read the same way regular books are; they&rsquo;re meant to be skimmed. Even so, I still have trouble. Maybe it&rsquo;s only the university level textbooks that are causing me trouble. but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they should be any less readable. <span id="more-236"></span></p>

<p>The focus of textbooks are not readability, unfortunately. However, there are some small things that textbooks can do to increase what readability they do have. These little points can also help with the readability for general typography, especially on the web.</p>

<h3 id="headers-headers-headers">Headers, headers, headers</h3>

<p>Usually chapters are split into sections. For example chapter 4 would have sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc. That&rsquo;s not enough for me. The &ldquo;best&rdquo; textbooks I&rsquo;ve read further delve at least two more sub-sections than this. Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to see one or two headers a page. Splitting text into chunks makes it easier to skim and easier on the eyes. Using different colours, reasonable margins, and heavier font weighting of the headers add even more to the readability.</p>

<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>

<p>I love lists. I love reading lists, I love making lists, and I learn well with lists. My notes are usually one huge list. Bullets are great for scanning. Soooo good for scanning. And when they&rsquo;re combined with headers, it&rsquo;s automatically a double combo.</p>

<h3 id="pictures">Pictures</h3>

<p>This is a no brainer. I&rsquo;m such a visual learner. I love pictures (if they&rsquo;re useful). I like pictures in the side margins, in the middle of the page, anywhere as long as it gives my brain a break from all of that text!</p>

<h3 id="bigger-text-and-greater-line-height">Bigger text and greater line-height</h3>

<p>I know textbook companies want to minimize the amount of money they spend making textbooks and that students want to spend less money on textbooks, but small fonts are so hard to read, especially when lines and lines of text are basically touching each other. If textbook companies did go this route, it might just force them to cut out all of the &ldquo;fluff&rdquo; and &ldquo;fillers&rdquo; in their textbooks. The less fluff, the better (unless you like fluff).</p>

<p>Now these are just things that I myself would like to see in textbooks. There are some great textbooks out there, and &ldquo;great&rdquo; is subjective and in some cases, textbooks don&rsquo;t need great readability. But the reality is, most textbook companies don&rsquo;t care. They write textbook companies for the boards and their approval, not for the students. Such is life in a capitalistic society.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested Reading</strong> is a weekly feature that runs every, you guessed it, Wednesday. In this feature, a website, blog, or article is showcased for further reading. One of the best things about the Internet is the ability to share. So why not take advantage of that and share some of my favourite things to read on the web? This weekâ€™s SR is a website that features e-books for download, <a href="http://thelibrariancode.com/suggested-reading-project-gutenberg/gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a>.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not a fan of e-books. I like keeping it traditional with the non-digital. However, I&rsquo;m a fan of free books. Project Gutenberg is just that.<span id="more-202"></span></p>

<p><strong>Straight from the website (links removed):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Project Gutenberg offers over 40,000 free ebooks: choose among free epub books, free kindle books, download them or read them online.</p>

<p>We carry high quality ebooks: All our ebooks were previously published by bona fide publishers. We digitized and diligently proofread them with the help of thousands of volunteers.</p>

<p>No fee or registration is required, but if you find Project Gutenberg useful, we kindly ask you to donate a small amount so we can buy and digitize more books. Other ways to help include digitizing more books, recording audio books, or reporting errors.</p>

<p>Over 100,000 free ebooks are available through our Partners, Affiliates and Resourc</p>

<p>es.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re worrying if this is legal: relax! The books that Project Gutenberg release are public domain, AKA those really old classics that you&rsquo;ve been meaning to read but just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to doing so yet. What makes it better is that you can bring those classics wherever you can go (not that you couldn&rsquo;t do that with regular ol&rsquo; books) but you can have dozens of those thick volumes on you without having to drag a bag across the floor. Another to be honest, that&rsquo;s the only thing I like about e-books.</p>

<p>Getting around Project Gutenberg can be a bit confusing (at least, I found it a bit confusing at first). You can sort through the books by title, author, language, and category. There is a large selection so expect lots of free words, and with good quality too!</p>

<p>While an awesome resource for books, the design and layout of the website unfortunately needs to be revamped (can&rsquo;t help the wannabe designer in me). What I find interesting is the use of the fancy book script font logo and their newer, more modern logo throughout the site. It&rsquo;s really a poor attempt at branding. Stick to one logo, and use that logo only! But, I guess this site can get away with it.</p>

<p>&hellip; Is getting an adult library card. I&rsquo;m not even joking. I detested the teen library card. It was too &ldquo;hip&rdquo; for me. So I rather like my simplistic and pretty white adult library card. The bad thing is that I have to memorize a new card number. Although the number for my new card has bits and pieces of my address and home phone number so I reckon it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>

<p>And so I made my first library haul of the year with my shiny new library card! It took me an hour because I was pressed for time and with the fact that I probably won&rsquo;t have too much time for reading. I finished one of them in a jiffy though.<span id="more-210"></span></p>

<p>These pictures are pretty shoddy, mostly due to the fact that I took them with my only camera at the moment, my iPod. In case you can&rsquo;t read the titles in the pictures, here are the books I took out:</p>

<ul>
<li>At a Crossroads by Kate T. Williamson</li>
<li>The Twelve Kingdoms: Sea of Wind by Fuyumi Ono</li>
<li>The Case for God by Karen Armstong</li>
<li>Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life by Karen Armstrong</li>
<li>A Short History of Myth by Karen Armstrong</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can tell, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Karen Armstrong. I&rsquo;ve read her memoir, &ldquo;Through the Narrow Gate,&rdquo; and watched her prize winning TED talk, &ldquo;The Charter for Compassion&rdquo; and loved both of them. Armstrong is clearly an eloquent, intelligent, and passionate woman, and I cannot begin to explain how much I admire her for it. I can&rsquo;t wait to dig into my first reads of 2013!</p>

<p>I &#8216;m starting my reading with &ldquo;The Case for God&rdquo; by Karen Armstrong first (for now), mostly because I don&rsquo;t want to find myself two days before the due date and finding myself just starting it. Although on second thought I just might read the shorter ones first, but I&rsquo;ll see what happens. Once I get into reading any of Armstrong&rsquo;s work, I can&rsquo;t seem to put them down.</p>

        <p>As a Catholic, I&rsquo;m always working towards understanding my faith, living my faith, properly representing my faith, and lately: being in harmony with those who do not share my faith. A couple of years ago, I was an ignorant little brat, believing myself better than others who didn&rsquo;t actually identify as Catholic despite going to a Catholic school. That mentality quickly faded away once high school began but that didn&rsquo;t mean that I became &ldquo;any less Catholic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried my best to keep a delicate balance between my more secular values and my, well, not so secular values. It&rsquo;s hard. I still try to do this today. More often than not, my secular values seem to dominate over everything else but I still have this longing to grow in my faith and fully live it out.</p>

<p>Earlier on this semester, the campus bookstore was having a hallway sale. It was my break time, I had nothing better to do and the prices seemed cheap enough, so I went ahead and browsed for around half an hour. There were a couple of books that intrigued me but there was one book that kept me coming back to it. &ldquo;Through the Narrow Gate: Life In and Out of the Convent&rdquo; by Karen Armstrong.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This book is a memoir of Armstrong&rsquo;s first 20 or so years of her life. In this journey we see her as a child, a young teenaged girl, a nun, and then back to a child. Despite the fact that the back of the book advertised the author&rsquo;s falling out Catholicism and/or the convent, I bought it anyway. It was a great read and I completely fell in love with Ms. Armstrong&rsquo;s writing.</p>

<p>Recently, I downloaded Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;iTunes U&rdquo; app for my iPod, hoping to find some interesting stuff about engineering and/or librarianship. I was quickly thrown off track with TED talks. Quickly browsing through some of their &ldquo;courses&rdquo; I decided to download &ldquo;Understanding Islam.&rdquo; One of my favourite videos in this course is &ldquo;The Charter for Compassion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I saw Armstrong&rsquo;s face appeared on the screen, I did not know it was her but I did know that she looked familiar. As she did her little intro and started talking in her English accent (in <em>Through the Narrow Gate</em> she mentions going to Oxford), I noticed her immediately.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;The Charter for Compassion&rdquo; Ms. Armstrong first talks about her fascination with Islam. She notes the similarities or the references Islam has with Christianity. Here comes the zinger: Ms. Armstrong then suggests that all religions expresses tolerance towards each other and therefore, she is launching. a &ldquo;charter for compassion&rdquo; that is devoted to uniting people of all faiths. It will promote true compassion towards the other and just being a decent human being.</p>

<p>Ms. Armstrong&rsquo;s vision is beautiful. Unfortunately, it is not realistic <strong><em>but we can come close to it.</em></strong> If only the whole world could look upon other religions with the same curiosity and respect that she does.</p>

<p>If you are interested in signing this charter, you can go <a href="http://charterforcompassion.org">here</a>. If you want to watch Ms. Armstrong speak for herself, click <a href="http://www.ted.com/themes/the_charter_for_compassion.html">here</a>.</p>
