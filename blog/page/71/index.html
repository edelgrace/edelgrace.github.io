        <p>Two blog posts in a week?? Is this even possible? I&rsquo;m probably dreaming but it&rsquo;s happening. For real.</p>

<p>Whenever I first get on the computer, I find myself starting out pretty darn focused. I open up Blackboard, see what&rsquo;s new, check my falling grades, cry, start on my assignments, etc. Then suddenly it&rsquo;s 1 in the morning (I&rsquo;m exaggerating, the latest I&rsquo;ve started homework was like 10pm&hellip; Still pretty bad though). So yeah, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;1 in the morning.&rdquo; I have a couple assignments due in a couple of hours and all I&rsquo;ve done was look at fanart of grey kids with horns. My first thought whenever this happens is, &ldquo;Where did all of my time go??&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried tracking the usage of my time before. I used a program called RescueTime but it was too broad. It told me what programs I was using and a few select sites that I frequented but it wasn&rsquo;t enough! Then I downloaded <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timestats/ejifodhjoeeenihgfpjijjmpomaphmah">timeStats</a> last week for Chrome.</p>

<p>Okay, this is a beautiful plugin. It&rsquo;s really easy to use too! Install it and wait and see how much time you waste on YouTube.</p>

<p>But what I really love about this little thing is the categories option. Every single website you visit is stored and you categorize them into your own categories. I made three of them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Productive:</strong> The websites I want to be on. Such as my assignment websites and general uni stuff. Wolfram alpha may or may not be in this category&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>Potential time wasters:</strong> You know those sites that you go on with a purpose but then one hour later, you&rsquo;re still on said site without having fulfilled said purpose? Yeah, those sites.</li>
<li><strong>Time wasters:</strong> YouTube. Tumblr. Twitter. Facebook. Blogs. My blogs. My websites. Anything that can distract me for HOURS from my school work. Sadly, there are a lot of them&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Categories.png"><img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Categories-300x160.png" alt="Category breakdown" title="Categories" width="300" height="160" class="left" /></a></p>

<p>This plugin is really handy in that it displays the data clearly in pie charts and graphs. I&rsquo;m a sucker for pie charts and graphs. So let&rsquo;s look at my Internet usage in terms of these categories for the past week. Now these percentages probably don&rsquo;t mean anything to you so I&rsquo;ll quantify them even further. In other words, I&rsquo;ve spent 22:54 hours on time wasting sites, 11:17 hours on productive sites, and 6:30 hours on potential time wasting sites. I&rsquo;ve spent almost a day a week wasting my time. A day. For every productive hour, I spend two hours doing nothing. That&rsquo;s&hellip; Really discouraging. I mean I know I procrastinate a lot but I didn&rsquo;t know I procrastinated this much. The next burning question in my mind was, what sites do I spend most of my time on? And yes, timeStats gives you the answer to this too!</p>

<p><a href="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sites.png"><img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sites-300x156.png" alt="" title="Sites" width="300" height="156" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>Okay, well I already know the site I visit the most. <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. I spend an ungodly amount of my time on the damned website. A total of 11:50 hours this week. Microblogging is just so fast and easy. And most of all: addictive. All I&rsquo;m doing is looking at pictures people have shared with me and clicking a button to share it with other people. Probably the lowest form of &ldquo;blogging&rdquo; there ever is. But I do it anyway.</p>

<p>The second most visited site is a good one though, with a total of 4:42 hours. MathXL is my homework site for calculus. It&rsquo;s kinda sad that I&rsquo;ve spent 5 hours doing one assignment though. It was a fairly easy assignment too. I&rsquo;ve lost all faith in my calculus abilities&hellip; Not that I had much faith in them to begin with.</p>

<p>Google Docs is seriously SO HANDY for group projects that involve presentations and final reports. It&rsquo;s so much easier that way! <a href="http://mspaintadventures.com">MS Paint Adventures</a> is the website that hosts the web comic, Homestuck. Don&rsquo;t go there. There are over 7000 pages over silly shenanigans that are way too easily to get lost in. <a href="http://www.zachleat.com">Zachleat</a> has a useful alarm app that can play a YouTube video at full blast when it goes off. I use it a lot, apparently. More than I thought I ever did anyway. I also post a lot on the forums over at <a href="ubi.com">Ubi</a>. About the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed series. It&rsquo;s a good game, okay?? And the rest of the sites are pretty straightforward. Like Facebook, for example. It&rsquo;s evil.</p>

<p>So yes, my findings with this little plugin is this: I spend too much time doing irrelevant shi&hellip;take mushrooms on the Internet. But I&rsquo;m working on it! First off by limiting my Tumblr use. Although most of my attempts are like this:</p>

<p>Me: Go away Tumblr, I don&rsquo;t need you anymore. All you do is CAUSE ME PAIN.</p>

<p>Tumblr: Ok bye.</p>

<p>Me: Just kidding. I can&rsquo;t live without you. Never leave me. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?? COME BACK HERE!</p>

<p>Yeah okay I have finals to study for. Bye for now!</p>

        <p>Usually I bring a textbook with me on the train to study from but today I had only one lecture and I definitely forgot to bring one. So I decided it would be good to write a blog post for once because I really do miss writing these things.</p>

<p>Christmas is indeed in the air! Last week in the food court on campus, Christmas carols were playing and a Santa was walking around asking for donations for some charity. I&rsquo;m definitely in the holiday spirits!</p>

<p>My dad though is a Christmas fanatic. On the first of November, we put our Christmas tree up. Yeah. The <strong>first of November</strong>. The family was all home for once and my brother and I put up the decorations on the tree while mom sang Christmas songs and my dad took pictures of us. It was really festive but really way to early to do those things (I had fun either way).</p>

<p>Around two weeks ago he put up the Christmas lights. We got some really long Christmas lights from a family friend because they moved to a condo. My dad put the lights on top of the fence, around all the windows, and even on my little evergreen tree (&ldquo;little&rdquo; even though it&rsquo;s taller than me&hellip; And I&rsquo;m the older one!). As well, my dad plays the Christmas station all the time! I&rsquo;m serious. When he&rsquo;s driving, it&rsquo;s all he listens to. And whenever he&rsquo;s home and not sleeping, he&rsquo;s listening to it. In the morning he boosts up the volume until it&rsquo;s deafeningly loud to wake us up.</p>

<p>He also loves telling us about Christmas in the Philippines. When he was younger he&rsquo;d go caroling door to door for food. And then they&rsquo;d go play outside until midnight and light fireworks and firecrackers. It&rsquo;s really cute when my dad gets in the holiday spirit. It runs off on me too!</p>

<p>Even though I am feeling the holiday cheer, I am absolutely dreading the days as they pass by. Why?</p>

<p>Finals.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of season again! My first final is this Monday, and I&rsquo;m kind of terrified. Programming is pretty easy if you do all the labs and pay attention. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll at least pass that one. The other ones&hellip; I&rsquo;m not so sure! I&rsquo;m taking a course which is kind of like chemistry. I always just seem to let it slip amongst everything else. There&rsquo;s no mandatory homework except for labs and I never do any practice problems or anything. Mostly because I do have mandatory homework in the rest of my classes and I just don&rsquo;t bother about my chemistry-like course. It&rsquo;s really bad, I know. As much as I&rsquo;d like to study that and only that until the exam, I&rsquo;d probably fail the rest of my exams. Oh well, I&rsquo;ll just do what I can, I guess!</p>

        <p>I have a whole load of things to do this weekend. Not sure if I&rsquo;ll actually get around to doing those said things. But at least my midterms are finally over! But finals start up in two weeks. Huh. Now that I&rsquo;ve made a list of things I need to, it doesn&rsquo;t really seem like that much but considering my procrastination habits, it is quite a lot. Weekends are for relaxing, not for drowning myself in tears. Funny how my calculus teacher in high school once said that his roommates in university only did homework on Sunday afternoons. 12 hours is not enough to do homework anymore. And I definitely started typing &ldquo;homestuck&rdquo; instead of homework, Hussie what are you doing to me? So yeah, here&rsquo;s my list of things to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computers post-lab</li>
<li>Computers pre-lab</li>
<li>Computers in-lab</li>
<li>Behaviour of liquids, solids, and gases lab</li>
<li>Calculus homework</li>
<li>Linear algebra homework</li>
<li>Start studying for finals</li>
<li>Work on video game project for design</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a list of things I want to do. Sadly, only one of those things are present on my things I need to do list. It looks like I got my work cut out for me, yeah?</p>

<ul>
<li>Read lots and lots of Homestuck</li>
<li>Work on video game project for design</li>
<li>Replay some Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 (I actually want to read pay more attention to what&rsquo;s happening at least try to)</li>
<li>Write a review/reaction/long ass rant about Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 (I have a lot of feelings about this franchise)</li>
<li>Work on my database of books</li>
<li>Work on other things that require coding of the HTML considering I haven&rsquo;t done that in a while</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a list of what I&rsquo;m doing right now. Gosh darn it, I&rsquo;m so productive.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>Neopets</li>
<li>Reading Homestuck</li>
<li>Thinking of starting my behaviour of liquids, solids, and gases lab</li>
</ul>

<p>I spend too much on Tumblr, it&rsquo;s so addicting. I used to scoff at the idea of micro-blogging but now every time I want to make a really long wall of text, I go straight to Tumblr instead of here. It kinda makes me sad. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s more accessible for my friends. But why do I even want my friends to know about the stuff I do? I think it&rsquo;s some weird social media thing. Like how on Facebook you make your life seem more interesting than it really is. That&rsquo;s kinda like what I used Tumblr for. Tumblr is like a giant mess of my thoughts. If you want to know what I&rsquo;m currently obsessing about, Tumblr is the place to look. It&rsquo;s just really good cathartic way of expressing myself. Social media, why must you do this to me?</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been really unmotivated lately. I <em>should</em> be busy with school, but I really am not. Little things keep on discouraging me and causes me to lose sight of the end goal. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with me. I keep telling myself, &ldquo;This is your future at stake! Do you really want to be working 2 or 3 part time jobs?&rdquo; But even so, it does nothing. I&rsquo;m at the point where I seriously think, even for a second, to hell with society. I&rsquo;ll live in my parent&rsquo;s basement for the rest of my life doing whatever the heck I want to do. Society frowns upon those people but gosh darn it, they&rsquo;re happy. They&rsquo;re living life the way they want to.</p>

<p>I really just want the semester to be over. Take the Christmas break to reevaluate my life. Weed out all of the things I don&rsquo;t need. Begin a new clean slate. Take charge of my websites again. Learn some time management. Will it really happen? I sure hope so.</p>

<p>On a lighter note. I bought Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 last weekend. It. Was. Beautiful. Extremely frustrating, but beautiful. The graphics were clean and crisp. The landscapes huge and wide and just overall stunning. Assassin&rsquo;s Creed has always been about details. Oh the details. The turkeys. The spray of snow at your heels. And limbs of a tree bouncing as you land on it. Ahhhh. Wonderful. As always, the story is really engaging and oh god, the twists and the turns. AND THE FEELS. All of my feels. It&rsquo;s a bit saddening to see this arc end. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next one, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Even though AC3 was really good, it was largely unpolished. Surprisingly buggy too. I know no one can catch all the bugs but I&rsquo;m surprised so many slipped through the cracks. It&rsquo;s not the fact that they&rsquo;re there but how many there are. The soundtrack is a bit disappointing too. Good. But not as good as the ones in previous titles. It definitely has to do with the fact that Jesper Kyd was not doing this soundtrack. Not to discredit Lorne Balfe of course. He composed great pieces but they lacks personality and atmosphere. The story was awesome (like I already said), but some parts of the game I was confused as to why I was doing certain things or how things were happening. Oh well. Still an awesome game overall. I&rsquo;ll probably go into more detail in a later post as I&rsquo;ve been itching to rant and ramble more about the game.</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Reaction blog posts are probably not blog posts at all but rather, a mass wall of incoherent garble of text. This probably belongs on something like Tumblr but it was too long and you know Tumblr kids. There are <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> spoilers (yeah, you read that right, and FOR ALL OF THE GAMES too) and obviously, <em>The Afterman: Ascension</em> spoilers ahead. Tread carefully. I&rsquo;ve probably scared everyone away anyhow, haha.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of <a href="http://mspaintadventures.com">Homestuck</a>. It&rsquo;s basically a online web comic that follows the crazy video game adventures of these kids. I can&rsquo;t exactly describe it without spoiling major aspects but oh my goodness gravy, it is probably one of the most entertaining and time consuming things in the world.</p>

<p>The reason why I bring this up is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to get my friend to read Homestuck, but he has been hesitant to do so. So we struck a deal. I buy the latest <strong>Coheed and Cambria</strong> album, and then he&rsquo;ll read Homestuck. I finally bought it today. My bus stop is literally beside a Wal-Mart so it wasn&rsquo;t a major inconvenience. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to have it for a while anyway because I&rsquo;ve recently made a pact to <del>cut down</del> stop downloading music because all of the bands I listen to deserve all of my money.</p>

<p>So yes, I bought <em>The Afterman: Ascension</em> today. I just unwrapped the plastic and now it&rsquo;s sitting before me on the desk. It&rsquo;s a wonderful case. It&rsquo;s not like your typical CD jewel case, it&rsquo;s a cardboard tri-fold thing. The cover features amazing artwork of The Afterman being &ldquo;split by the entities&rdquo; as lead singer, Claudio has described it in his many video logs about the album. I actually have no idea what these &ldquo;entities&rdquo; are. Coheed and Cambria have a tendency to create a story line with their music and I unfortunately don&rsquo;t really follow it. It&rsquo;s an amazing concept just one that I don&rsquo;t indulge in. Anyway, more about the case.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tri-fold kind of thing. Once you open it halfway, the CD is there and the Afterman logo. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what to call it but it looks absolutely stunning. Open it up again, and there&rsquo;s even more beautiful artwork. It&rsquo;s very abstract and eerie, I love it so much! Also, there&rsquo;s a flap inside that holds the lyric booklet. Even the lyric booklet is beautiful. The lyrics are paired up with their respective artwork. The page with the lyrics on them is so pleasing to look at. Beautiful serif font bordered with simple grey. The colour scheme is absolutely lovely as well. Orange and blue, my favourite colour combination!</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve listened to three of the tracks on this album. They&rsquo;ve all been extremely different from each other so I&rsquo;m interested in how the album will sound like. I have no clue right now. <em>Domino</em> was released as a single (?) or at least, as a music video. It. Was. Amazing. Probably one of the best Coheed songs out there (you can read more on how I feel about it <a href="http://musical.brokenphrases.info/2012/09/three-songs-ive-been-playing-on-repeat/">here</a>). <em>Holly Wood</em> was leaked and I <del>was forced to listen to it by my friend</del> listened to it and I was also quite impressed. Lastly, <em>The Afterman</em>. At first I wasn&rsquo;t too taken by it but as soon as I watched the lyric video posted on Coheed&rsquo;s YouTube channel, I loved it right away.</p>

<p>Now onto listening to the album. I&rsquo;m actually kinda scared for some reason but I&rsquo;m also bursting with excitement.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Okay so it literally just took me a minute to try to get the disk out, I fail at these kind of things. I was scared of snapping the disk or something like that. How horrible would that be? Okay, don&rsquo;t think about something as blasphemous as that. Now onto the listening for real this time.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Hollow (2:11)</strong></p>

<p>Woah beautiful piano intro thing. Impresseeeed. Wow. Wowowowow. All these layers of sound go beautifully together. Ah, there&rsquo;s some spoken words. I&rsquo;m kinda freaked out.</p>

<ul>
<li>I just had goosebumps. There&rsquo;s a conversation between who I&rsquo;m guessing is the Afterman and this so called, &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; The voice of the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; is extremely haunting. It&rsquo;s really distorted, sounding female but with a layer of a male voice. The last few seconds is just one note struck and some clattering of some sort. Then it&rsquo;s slowly building up to Domino.
Okay reaction time. Wow. That was&hellip; Entrancing. Simple of course, seeing as it&rsquo;s just an intro but still entrancing. I still have goosebumps. To be honest, as soon as I heard the voice of the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; I thought of Minvera and Juno from the <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> series. Some weird god and alien-like entity with the same kind of distortions, wow it&rsquo;s just so creepy and so good at the same time. At the end of the song, you can here the song swell and just build up to Domino and wow I&rsquo;m so impressed right now, yes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Key Extraction I: Domino the Destitue (7:51)</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already stated my feelings for this song (<a href="http://musical.brokenphrases.info/2012/09/three-songs-ive-been-playing-on-repeat/">over here</a>) but I&rsquo;ll repeat myself anyway. Wow. This song. WOOOOOW. I love it. Nearly 8 minutes of yummy Coheed goodness. Even though it&rsquo;s nearly 8 minutes, it definitely does not seem like it at all. Okay time to actually listen to this song with awesome CD quality.</p>

<p>THOSE GUITARS. HNNG. The quality is so top notch, I can&rsquo;t even. A huge grin is on my face right now. The little riff in the beginning is beautiful because of the slight echo it&rsquo;s amazing. OH GOD. CLAUDIO&rsquo;S VOICE. THE WORST IN EVERYBODY&rsquo;S EYES. GOOD BAD UGLY OR OTHERWISE. There&rsquo;s so much right with this song. It&rsquo;s hard to focus on one element of the song because beautiful sounds are coming from everywhere. OHHH. YOU THINK THEY&rsquo;D HAVE IT ALL WHILE YOU WERE LEFT WITH NOTHING. YOU&rsquo;VE MADE YOUR BED SO SOFT AND COMFORTING. Right now I&rsquo;m just singing along, haha. This is toooooo good. I IMPLORE BROTHER DON&rsquo;T WALK AWAY DON&rsquo;T WALK AWAY FROM ME. &#8216;CAUSE THIS IS OUR WAAAAR. Seriously, the quality of this is top notch ugh almost perfect. YOUR TIME HAS COME IT&rsquo;S NOW OR NEVER. WE MADE OUR BEDS. TO LIE IN THEM PROUD. THIS WARRING KNIFE THE FLASH OF BLADE. DON&rsquo;T WALK AWAY. DON&rsquo;T WALK AWAY FROM ME. &#8216;CAUSE THIS IS OUR WAAAR. ONE BY ONE. WE ARE TOGETHER. WE FALL TOGETHER. ONE BY ONEEEE. BROTHER DON&rsquo;T BE AFRAID.</p>

<p>Wonderful climax for this song, I can&rsquo;t even. Ugh this song is so perfect why why why why why why.</p>

<p><strong>3. The Afterman (3:11)</strong></p>

<p>This song was apparently written for Chondra, Claudio&rsquo;s wife. She had lost a friend and was feeling extremely down about it. When I first listened to this song I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed but when I watched the lyric video and saw the lyrics for the first time, I fell in love. I too know the pain of losing a friend and it just struck a chord with me and I was reduced to tears. Whenever I listen to this song, I feel strangely comforted but that feeling of loss is still there. I just love this song to bits. Love, love, love, love it.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the song is perfect. <em>She gave her heart. To a falling star. Around the declines. As the tears from her eyes fall. No one understands and no one will. If he&rsquo;s not here then where? If he&rsquo;s not here then where?</em> Goosebumps. <em>Your selfishness has robbed you of the man you could have been. I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing about you. I love you dearly, my friend.</em> Tears. Tears everywhere. <em>My love, I&rsquo;ve been searching for my afterman.</em></p>

<p>This is surprisingly short, a bit disappointed about that but still good nevertheless.</p>

<p><strong>4. Mothers of Men (4:11)</strong></p>

<p>Woah. That first note. Woah. That bass. Oh damn, that bass. The atmosphere of this song is completely sinister. I love it. The guitar seems to be mirroring Domino in a way. I love that backing vocals. The smooth ring sounds beautiful against Claudio&rsquo;s. Oh god. When the instruments suddenly stop or drop in volume and Claudio is just singing, woah. I haven&rsquo;t written much about this song. I think it&rsquo;ll have to grow on me. But oh. Oh my. It&rsquo;s good. There&rsquo;s tapping? I&rsquo;m kinda freaked out. And now a weird din. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit.&rdquo; Lol what. What?? The din is growing louder and louder and man just said, &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; Goosebumps, I tell you. GOOSEBUMPS.</p>

<p><strong>5. Goodnight, Fair Lady (3:23)</strong></p>

<p>This one feels very familiar. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on it. This is so good though. Kinda sounds. I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it. It seems very much like a happier tune. I like it. Catchy. I want to dance along to it actually, which is weird. I&rsquo;m seriously liking this, wow. GOODNIGHT GOODNIGHT FAIR LADY. I&rsquo;M A SNAKE WAITING FOR YOU, DEAR. I KNOW YOU WELL. The little piano lift thing seemed out of the place though. Even more clattering, what is this?? &ldquo;Caution: Second Identity Identified&rdquo; WTF SO CREEPY SO MINERVA/JUNO LIKE OMG.</p>

<p><strong>6. Key Entity Extraction II: Holly Wood the Cracked (3:26)</strong></p>

<p>Oh man. OH MAN. This one is a good one. Sooo sinister is the first few seconds. It&rsquo;s almost sinful. This one was leaked. Glad to hear it in awesome quality. Claudio is sooo sinister as fuck in this, fuck. HOLLY WOOD HOLLY WOOD. WATCH OUT HERE SHE COMES. I really like the clean part in this song. The chorus is beautiful. Claudio&rsquo;s voice sounds best clean. SHE&rsquo;S SHORT A FEW CARDS OF A FULL DECK. A JOKER IN THE GAME. POOR HOLLY WOOD. POOR HOLLY WOOD. I love how Claudio belts out &ldquo;poor Holly Wood.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Holly&rdquo; is just wonderful. It kinda sounds like he&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;Holly Word&rdquo; though, haha. Woah. Nanananana. That part. Awesome. Awesooome.</p>

<p>Damn. More creepy ass ambiance. Echoing voice. Distortion. Holy fuck. wHAT IS HAPPENING.</p>

<p><strong>7. Key Entity Extraction III: Vic the Butcher (5:47)</strong></p>

<p>Love this one so far. Much more aggressive than Holly Wood. And raw as well. Claudio&rsquo;s voice is shining with the echoing. A lot more shouting in this one. Holy crap, the backing vocals. &ldquo;LALALALA&rdquo; woah. I&rsquo;m liking this one but it seems to be taking forever. HANG EM UP, HANG EM UP NOW. Woah half way through the song. WHAT. IS. THIS. BEAUTIFUL. SOUND. I like this one but it&rsquo;s gonna take some time for sure.</p>

<p>Now for more ambiance. It&rsquo;s so freaky. I&rsquo;m kinda freaked out. So freaked out. ASSASSIN&rsquo;S CREED SOBS. How many entities are there I know it says it but still.</p>

<p><strong>8. Key Entity Extraction IV: Evagria the Faithful (6:22)</strong></p>

<p>Woah this one is sounding cool. Awesome intro for this song. Do-bopping going on. And Claudio&rsquo;s clean vocals. Woah. The first bang of drums. Oh man. OHHHH MAN. GOOD BYE FOREVER. Woah. Woah. I like this. I have been hit with so much awesomeness that I can&rsquo;t even form correct words. THIS HURT WON&rsquo;T, WON&rsquo;T GO AWAY. Wow. That is like a weird chant. I love it. YOU WON&rsquo;T BE FORGOTTEEEEEEN. Wow that note Claudio hangs on to, I keep replaying it. The chanting. The atmosphere is just so cool and mysterious and jungle-like. I like it. I love it. Someone please. Oh.</p>

<p><strong>9. Subtraction (3:07)</strong></p>

<p>This one is sounding very electronic. Wow. Lower voice Claudio. Almost doesn&rsquo;t sound like it. This is totally a love song of sorts. Okay, break up song actually, welp. SUBTRACT ME FROM YOUR HEART. Wow. This is wonderful. Acoustic with these weird beeping sounds. ONE STEP AT A TIME. I really like this. Although Claudio&rsquo;s end notes are bothering me. And the off tune (?) twangs of the guitar. So good though.</p>

<p>THIS ALBUM. GETS AN <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> JK I&rsquo;M NOT RATING IT AT ALL. But this album is crazy good. So far my only favourites are the ones that I have already listened to before but that will soon change. Now I&rsquo;m off to do my many, many, many assignments, haha. </p></p>
