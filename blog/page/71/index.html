        <p>I was browsing through some blogs yesterday and came across a blog dedicated to a cat. The blog, <a href="http://sisinmaru.blog17.fc2.com/">I Am Maru</a> is ridiculously cute. It&rsquo;s about a cat named Maru who lives in Japan. The owner likes to take pictures of Maru and put cute captions underneath it. I really think it&rsquo;s adorable.</p>

<p>I love cats. They&rsquo;re just so fluffy and moody (for some reason, that&rsquo;s what I love about them). Sadly, I&rsquo;m 99% sure I&rsquo;m allergic to cats. My eyes get red, puffy, and watery whenever I&rsquo;m around cats. I also sneeze like a maniac. It&rsquo;s unfortunate because I&rsquo;ve always loved cats. Maybe one day I could get a hairless or hypoallergenic cat. Like a sphynx or something. Although, anything that&rsquo;s hairless kinda freaks me out. Remember Kim Possible? I looked at a real picture of a real naked mole rat because of it. After that, I was never the same again. Sphynx cats kinda looks cute though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I start school in nine days. I&rsquo;m excited but a bit scared. My last year of high school! Then I&rsquo;ll be somewhat pushed into the real world.</p>

<p>I took some of your suggestions and started looking at scholarships and such. There&rsquo;s a lot of them. I found this one scholarship that give $3,000 for every year for three years if you&rsquo;re studying on the oil and gas industry, which is exactly what I&rsquo;m planning on doing. That would be <strong>a lot</strong> of help. So I&rsquo;m going to have to work even harder this year. My schedule is packed and I anticipate a whole load of work. Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna relax as much as I can over the next nine days.</p>

        <p>Wow, it&rsquo;s already August! I can&rsquo;t believe it. Summer is half way done. No way. I wish summer break was longer. I don&rsquo;t want to think about school yet. Although I&rsquo;m extremely excited to start shopping for school supplies. That&rsquo;s honestly my favourite part of going back to school. I&rsquo;m in love with stationary. Notebooks and binders are something I go through very quickly&hellip;</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. It looks like I haven&rsquo;t blogged in a while, but I have. A lot of my posts that I made within the past nine days are set to private. Why? Because they contain very personal content and I don&rsquo;t want to have a physical diary. For some reason, I have more motivation to do it on my blog than on paper. I&rsquo;ve been keeping diaries for a while and because of that my family members are more likely to find it. I&rsquo;m horrible at hiding the fact that I have a diary. There&rsquo;s absolutely no privacy in this house. Seeing that my parents are technologically illiterate, I am basically free to do whatever as long as my parents aren&rsquo;t watching over my shoulder. As for my brother, what I say on the Internet doesn&rsquo;t bother him as long as I don&rsquo;t bad mouth him (which I don&rsquo;t). So yeah, this blog is like a diary to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday I came home from camping for two days. For some reason, camping isn&rsquo;t that fun for me anymore. I miss the old days when my family, extended family, and family friends would always go camping as a big huge family. There hasn&rsquo;t been a gathering that big in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but I&rsquo;ve been thinking about family a lot. My family here in Canada and in the Philippines. A couple of days ago, I was Skyping with my cousin and my grandparents in the Philippines. I guess you can say I&rsquo;ve been under the weather since then because I really miss my family that lives in that part of the world. My parents want to visit since my grandmother&rsquo;s health is rapidly deteriorating but the trip will cost too much and with me going to university in a year, it just seems out of the question.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve never been filthy rich but we&rsquo;ve been comfortable. A couple of times we&rsquo;ve had some rough spots when it came to money but we managed to always get by. My parents have always stressed the importance of education because they never had the opportunity to continue theirs after high school. The Philippines is a third world country and my parents worked insanely hard to get here in Canada. Since my parents don&rsquo;t have a good education, they&rsquo;re stuck with part time jobs. On top of that, they&rsquo;re always sending money to their family in the Philippines and they&rsquo;ve been doing that for the past twenty years. They&rsquo;ve managed to sponsor some of my aunts, uncles, and cousins to come here to work in Canada to do the same. Yeah, my family is still definitely luckier than others but we still have problems.</p>

<p>I know my mom is worried about her own mother and I just feel guilty that my going to school could prevent her from seeing my grandmother one last time. For me, family would definitely come first before education but my mom also has her heart on me going next year. But money is a big issue.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just wish money was never an issue. Not with just my own problems but with the whole world. Money is just a source of problems but I guess that without money, our world would be in even more chaos than right now but that&rsquo;s an entirely different issue. The world is just unfair.</p>

<p>How I got into this topic, I don&rsquo;t even know. This blog post was all over the place but I feel a whole lot better after letting out some steam. Ah, the day in the life of a second generation immigrant.</p>

        <p><img src="http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/5523/39939868.png" alt="Showbands Live" style="float:left;width:50%;height:50%;padding:5px;" /></p>

<p>Over a week ago I went to the Stampede grounds to see Showbands Live. Showbands Live is an annual marching band competition. Every year there are the regulars (The Stetsons Calgary Showband, The Red Deer Royals, and Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts). Last year I was part of the Ghosts and I wanted to support them and see them compete. This year there were a lot of American bands that were participating. There are no words to describe how amazing each band was.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of all the acts that preformed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chinook Country Line Dancers</li>
<li>A Band of Outriders</li>
<li>The Red Deer Royals</li>
<li>The Renegade Regiment (US)</li>
<li>Calgary Stampede Showband</li>
<li>Lighthouse Brigade of Recine (US)</li>
<li>Calgary Stetsons Showband</li>
<li>Sound of Sun Prairie (US)</li>
<li>Shadow Armada (US)</li>
<li>Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/8065/76386837.png" alt="Stetsons" style="float:right;width:50%;height:50%;padding:5px;" /></p>

<p>All the bands were great but a few of them really stuck out to me. First things first, The Stetsons. The Stetsons is our rival band. For some reason, we don&rsquo;t like each other and it&rsquo;s been that way for a long time. Their show was pretty&hellip; decent. However, it bore a ton of similarities to Grandin&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s show. It was pretty obvious that they took some inspiration from our show, even copying some charts and formations. Even the concept of the show was the same. Other than that, it was a decent show. I think it relied to heavily on props but the music was pretty good.</p>

<p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s The Shadow Armada. They were from the US, a high school marching band. I must say that they were extremely impressive. Their show was extremely precise, the music was amazing, and the visuals just wow. I really loved their drumline. I have a soft spot for good drumlines even though I play a woodwind instrument. The drum solos were intricate and just so darn catchy. The Shadow Armada was a great marching band and really a great treat to watch. So great that they won first place. They really deserved as they were just that amazing.</p>

<p><img src="http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3755/71936535.png" alt="Grandin Ghosts" style="float:left;width:50%;height:50%;padding:5px;" /></p>

<p>Of course, I have to mention my own band, the Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts. After listening to them play their show music every day of the week before school, I have to say that they really improved from the beginning of the year. Their music was just amazing and so epic, and loud, and in your face. The show wasn&rsquo;t up to par with the early morning practices unfortunately. Still, their show was pretty good. Better than the Stetsons of course. Their theme was &ldquo;Pandora&rsquo;s Box&rdquo;. It was pretty cool because they had an actual box. It was glowing and spouting fog and everything. I have to say it was cool to see a prop like that. Sadly, they only landed third place but their competitors were tough. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m so proud of them!</p>

<p>Speaking of Grandin, I finished summer school two days ago. I finished the course with a 95% and a 98% on my final exam. Wow, I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s over. Now I can sleep in, stay up late, and blog as much as I want, haha.</p>

        <p>I have another week to go! I&rsquo;m just ready for it all to be over. Today was a good day because during my 15 minute break, I met up with one of my friends in the hallway. He and the school marching band been in the US for a while and just came back last night so I had a good talk with him. For a moment, I forgot I had school until the bell rang for the end of the break. Tomorrow after school, I&rsquo;m going to watch my school&rsquo;s marching band compete. Every year during Stampede, there&rsquo;s a marching band competition. I was in band last year and we won first place, so I hope they&rsquo;ll win again!</p>

<p>Speaking of Stampede (an annual 10 day festival/rodeo), a couple days ago, Prince William and Princess Kate came by and participated in our Stampede Parade. I didn&rsquo;t get to watch it but my brother did and he said the Prince William looked pretty mad, faking happiness, and/or bored throughout the whole thing. I can&rsquo;t say that I blame him. The man is probably tired of touring everywhere and just wants to go home.</p>

<p>Going on with the Stampede talk, although I&rsquo;m going to the Stampede tomorrow, I&rsquo;m only going to watch my friends compete. Going to the Stampede every year is expensive. You have to pay the entrance fee and then buy tickets for rides, games, and such. I&rsquo;m not much of a rider but I love watching various performances and acts. I also/mostly enjoy the food. Cotton candy, sweet and salty popcorn, and mini doughnuts is a must for every year. I can eat those things any other day of the year, but it&rsquo;s just not the same if it&rsquo;s not from the Stampede grounds. My stomach is happy just thinking about it.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I started summer school. I said before that I had to take Religion 35 because it&rsquo;s required to graduate and I have no room in my schedule for it next year. So, yesterday I woke up at 6:30 AM sharp, ate my breakfast, changed, and dashed out the door. Usually the first day of school isn&rsquo;t intimidating but for some reason, the first day of summer school was extremely nerve wrecking. Students from all highschools in my city go to my school for summer school. A lot of my friends are in marching band and are currently in the US right now so I barely know anyone there.</p>

<p>A lot of the kids used the main entrance to go into the school and I was the only one (that I saw) who used the side doors to get in. I got a couple of weird looks as I did but I shrugged it off. I guess there&rsquo;s not a lot of kids who go to my school who are going to summer school. So, I make my way to the foyer and the teachers are rounding up everyone into the gym. I walk in and see the bleachers filled with kids and I have no idea where to sit. Once I reached the end of the gym, I turned around to see someone I knew. Ah, I was filled with relief when I saw her. So we sat down, talked about our short 2 week break, what we&rsquo;re taking, etc.</p>

<p>Then the principal of summer school came and talked about rules, expectations, etc. Then he started to call out the classes by name. I hear Religion 15, and Religion 25 but not Religion 35. Maybe my hearing&rsquo;s going, but I swear I did not hear him say Religion 35. I tag along with this kid who I know is in my Religion 35 class and follow him to our class. We were a little bit late but it was the first day so it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>My teacher (I&rsquo;ll call him Mr. W) is extremely nice. He has a dry sense of humour (it&rsquo;s so dry that it&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious) and can actually teach. My past religion teachers have been nothing but weird experiences. One was so creepy that all of his students (I mean <strong>all</strong> of his students) think he&rsquo;s a pedophile, another made us watch movies all the time (not to say that I don&rsquo;t like movies, but I didn&rsquo;t learn a thing!), and the other one liked to talk about sex even though we weren&rsquo;t doing the family life unit. Yeah, I kinda prefer Mr. W over all of them.</p>

<p>So the day ended with a couple of questions for homework and a part 1 of a project to finish. Currently I am finishing up part 2 of said project. Actually, I&rsquo;m procrastinating but I say I did a lot so I&rsquo;m &ldquo;taking a break&rdquo;.</p>

<p>To get my mind off of school, I came across an amazing song. I&rsquo;m a Tumblr addict and I got my friend to intervene for me. Tumblr is my number one spot for finding out news about my favourite band, DIR EN GREY, as a lot of the people I follow are fellow Diru (as I affectionately call the band) fans. Recently they released a single and I totally did not know. It was a while ago as well, and I was deeply disappointed in myself. Their new song is called DIFFERENT SENSE. I absolutely love it. I can&rsquo;t put their music in any genre because they are so diverse. I&rsquo;d say it would be some type of metal. Metal core? Progressive? Sludge metal? I don&rsquo;t even know. All I know is that DIR EN GREY&rsquo;s music is amazing.</p>
