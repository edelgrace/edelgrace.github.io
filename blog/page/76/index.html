        <p>Technically this is the second trip to the library this year but this is the first post about it.</p>

<p>Right after I finished my chemistry diploma exam on Thursday, my dad drove me to the library. I felt at home, how sad, haha. Usually I go upstairs to the teen section, but oh ho, not this time! I went straight to the adult comics section. I&rsquo;m quite the rebel, I know. I mostly check to see if they have the last volume of <em>Mushishi</em> by Yuki Urushibara. They never do, but gah, I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>

<p>After that check, I go straight to see if there any books I haven&rsquo;t read in the P and M section to get my fix of Jodi Picoult and Haruki Murakami. Then I quickly scan the bookshelves to see if there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s on my to-read list. After that, I head up to the teens section. I scan the shelves again and then carefully inspect the comic book shelves. I&rsquo;ve pretty much read all the comics I want to read in the section but you never know.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my library list for that day. I&rsquo;m trying to lessen my loads as not to make it so intimidating to get through. And so I can minimalize the amount of books I return unread. I hate doing that&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/series/moon-boy">Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)</a> by Lee Young-You</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve read a some of this series and has been curious ever since then. I saw most of the volumes on the shelves but told myself to only get the first three instead of the first seven.</li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/cirque-du-freak-volume-7/">Cirque du Freak (Volume 7)</a> by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai</strong></p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s not a series I&rsquo;m extremely devoted to, it throws in some variety into my reading.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/perfect-match/">Perfect Match</a> by Jodi Picoult</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on a quest to read every single Jodi Picoult book there is.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/poster-boy/">Poster Boy</a> by Dede Crane</strong></p>

<p>The summary intrigued me, as I&rsquo;m always a sucker for books that deal with illnesses and the such.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Truth About Delilah Blue by Tish Cohen</strong></p>

<p>This has been on my to-read list for a while. I first saw it on display at Wal-Mart. I&rsquo;ve taken it out before but it was returned untouched.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami</strong></p>

<p>Another book I took out but returned it unfinished. I did start it but alas, I ran out of renewals on it. I&rsquo;m a new reader of Murakami&rsquo;s and have only read one of his works but I thoroughly enjoyed it and have heard great reviews for this book.</p></li>
</ul>

        <p>Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&rsquo;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong. I&rsquo;m hoping for the best. But I&rsquo;m still worried! My stomach hurts just thinking about it! Thankfully I don&rsquo;t have to go to school until Tuesday. Even then, it seems like not a long time.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I wrote my chemistry, I went to the library and stayed there for a good hour. I took out eight books. <em>Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)</em> by Lee Young-You, <em>Cirque Du Freak (Volume 7)</em> by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai, <em>Perfect Match</em> by Jodi Picoult, <em>Poster Boy</em> by Dede Crane, <em>The Truth About Delilah Blue</em> by Tish Cohen, and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami. You can read more about why I got those books <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/at-the-library-1/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Later on in the evening, I went to a youth group meeting at my parish. It was my first time there (and the first youth group meeting in a year) but I knew everyone there so I didn&rsquo;t really have to worry about social interactions and such. There was a lot of discussion going on, which was quite enjoyable I think. I&rsquo;m not much of a talker so I just listened. I left with a lot to think about, actually. The theme of that meeting was basically being aware of what&rsquo;s happening in the world. Of course, being young adults, we got off topic quite a couple of times but each topic was just as meaningful as the first. I&rsquo;m hoping to go regularly if time permits.</p>

<p>So, a couple days ago I finally transferred my domains from Go Daddy to Namecheap. Why? Because of the constant complaints I always hear about them, the poor customer service, and of course, SOPA. Yes, I do know that Go Daddy no longer supports SOPA and that SOPA is less likely to exist but the fact that they said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t support SOPA anymore&rdquo; right after Wikipedia and thousands more said they were going to move all of their domains from Go Daddy doesn&rsquo;t make them trustworthy in my eyes. It&rsquo;s quite apparent that they only made that statement because of all of the money and potential customers they lost. Good bye Go Daddy and good riddance!</p>

        <p>Most people&rsquo;s first post of the year is on the first, but no, I&rsquo;m unique and I&rsquo;ll have mine six days later. I&rsquo;ve been busy studying and working on <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">Room 304</a>. I&rsquo;m actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&rsquo;t study at all and now I&rsquo;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had quite a fun day. Firstly, went to Wal-Mart and bought <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> for our shiny new PS3 that we got over Christmas. Actually, I made the choice to buy it and not my brother. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to play that game ever since I had the demo on my iPod. Needless to say, when I got home I was glued to the TV screen and the controller for the rest of the day.</p>

<div align="center">
  <a href="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/448740e3.jpg"><img src="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/448740e3.jpg" alt="Assassin's Creed" width="50%" /></a>
</div>

<p>After that, we went to the library. I love the library. I could spend all day in there if the family weren&rsquo;t rushing every single time we go. I got four books and a CD.</p>

<div align="center">
  <a href="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/01482cc4.jpg"><img src="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/01482cc4.jpg" alt="books" width="50%" /></a>
</div>

<p>I nearly flipped out when I looked at the CD. <em>DIR EN GREY &#8211; DUM SPIRO SPERO</em>. Okay, if you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m a <strong>huge</strong> DIR EN GREY fan. They&rsquo;re a Japanese band so buying their music is really expensive (shipping costs, the horror) so I rarely buy anything of theirs. I&rsquo;ve been waiting to listen to this album for the longest time and I refused to download it anywhere. Now I can listen to it without feeling that guilty, because it&rsquo;s from the library. I&rsquo;m still going to buy it eventually though.</p>

<p>The thing about the library is that it&rsquo;s right next to the mall. Where did we go next? The mall. I don&rsquo;t like shopping for clothes but I need clothes so I had to buy clothes. That part was boring.</p>

<p>Like I said before, we got home and I spent the rest of the day playing <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em>. It&rsquo;s such a good game&hellip; I want the other Assassin&rsquo;s Creed games. Expect they&rsquo;re so expensive! Another time I guess.</p>

        <p>Yesterday was my birthday. Yay birthdays! I&rsquo;m now the golden age of 17 (this means I have to change all my ages on my websites, ack)! I kinda don&rsquo;t feel any different (no one ever does, am I right?), not to mention that 17 is a weird number. I guess it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s odd. But 21 and 23 aren&rsquo;t that weird of numbers either. I guess 17 is weird because it&rsquo;s that age that&rsquo;s in between. I&rsquo;m a teen but almost a legal adult. Oh, that&rsquo;s a scary thought.</p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday was a great day! It&rsquo;s far from one of the best birthdays ever but it was still loads of fun.</p>

<p>In the morning we woke up extra early to go to the weekday mass as church. After mass Father made the congregation sing happy birthday to me. It was embarrassing. Like, what do you do other than stand there awkwardly with a ridiculous grin on your face while people sing to you? I sure don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>After that we went home for a bit and then headed out for the mall. I invited a couple of friends for lunch and a movie. We watched the new Sherlock Holmes movie. I wanted to watch The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo but it&rsquo;s 18A. One of my frieds is already 18 so she could have bought the tickets for us but I didn&rsquo;t want her to. Good thing though because Sherlock Holmes is a great movie! Oh goodness, I loved it so much. Maybe even more than the first one. It had just the right mix of action, comedy, and wonderful deductions. Although I would have liked Sherlock to deduce more as he spent more screen time punching people or shooting a gun. Still, his antics were just golden.</p>

<p>I went home after the movie and fell asleep on my brother as he played on his shiny new PS3 since I was tired. I drooled a bit, haha. Then I was rudely awoken by him when our first visitors rang the doorbell. As more people came we started to eat. It was yummy dinner. Classic Filipino dishes and spaghetti. Although the spaghetti was quite dry, but shh, don&rsquo;t tell my mom that.</p>

<p>Overall it was a great day. I still can&rsquo;t get over the movie though. It&rsquo;s like when I watched Inception. Yeah, Inception. Don&rsquo;t judge me, I love that movie.</p>

        <p>Yesterday was my last day of school. It was pretty pointless as it was a half day and each class was half an hour long. We also had band practice in the morning! Thankfully it was cut short because the band teachers had to go carol with the other teachers at the front of the school. They actually sounded pretty good. I was expecting horrible off key belting and such but no. I&rsquo;m guessing they just picked the teachers who can actually sing well. Yes, I thought it was a reasonably good start for the day.</p>

<p>Then I had spare which, frankly, was extremely boring. Math was a bit better. We played &ldquo;Mind Trap&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s basically riddles and such. When I was in grade ten, I got some Mind Trap riddle cards from my Secret Santa at band. My favourite one was &ldquo;If A&rsquo;s peacock laid an egg in B&rsquo;s backyard in Philadelphia in 1932 during the Great Depression, who would be the rightful owner of the egg?&rdquo; The answer is the peahen because peacocks are males and can&rsquo;t lay eggs. Yeah, I know, weird. I love riddles like those but sometimes the answers are just make me want to scream, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My second highlight of the day was watching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters">Mythbusters</a> Christmas special. I love the Mythbusters. They&rsquo;re like Bill Nye the Science Guy but on steroids. The Christmas special was actually pretty cool. Adam and Jamie made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldberg Machine</a> out of Christmas objects and such. And then Kari, Grant, and Tory were seeing if (accidentally) dropping frozen turkeys on your pets could be lethal. Ah, &lsquo;twas a good episode.</p>

<p>I think this will be my last post of the year as my holidays will be extremely busy. Family outings, studying for exams, working on my websites, vegging out, etc etc. Typical holidays, haha. Have a great Christmas everyone! Take care and be safe!</p>

<p>EDIT [DEC 25, 2011]</p>

<p>Merry Christmas everybody! Christmas day was a good day. I got a new iPod Touch because mine broke recently. I&rsquo;m seriously super thankful. It&rsquo;s so pretty and shiny and (eek) expensive. That means more blog posts, more procrastination, and more caution, yes?</p>

<p>Today we went to the early morning mass. We had to altarserve for the mass. There was only 3 of us! I think we pulled it off nicely though. Unlike last night where I made a billon mistakes. Ugh, that was kind of embarassing. The priest even got super mad at me. Opps. My parents thought it was a nice mass though. Haha, sure.</p>

<p>Well, the end of the year draws near. I&rsquo;m starting my studying tomorrow. Doing nothing for the last three days only makes me more stressed. Merry Christmas again!</p>
