<p>Last week was the start of Reading Week. Reading Week is basically my university&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;midterm break&rdquo; where we have a week off. I don&rsquo;t have classes on Friday so my Reading Week started early.</p>

<h3 id="penguins">Penguins</h3>

<p>On Friday, my boyfriend and I went to the zoo. We really wanted to see the penguins and the red pandas. Every day, the penguins take a walk around the zoo. It was adorable. They are seriously bigger than I thought they were, probably up to my waist (I&rsquo;m also short though at 4&rsquo;11&rdquo;). They were so cute waddling up and down the sidewalk!</p>

<p>We also saw a couple of other animals. We really wanted to see the red panda feeding but their keeper was late. The pandas were sleeping and then one of them woke up for a couple of minutes. It scratched its head, walked around in a circle, then promptly went back to sleep. I wish I took a picture!</p>

<h3 id="hacks">Hacks</h3>

<p>An organization I&rsquo;m a part of at my university held a hackathon called <a href="http://calgaryhacks.tech">CalgaryHacks</a>. One of my friends is the co-founder and essentially the main person who ran it. This spanned over two days, Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>The prompt was &ldquo;long-range Internet of Things&rdquo; which involved the use of cellular technology. My team&rsquo;s idea was to make a bike thief detector. It would send a notification to your cell phone if the device detected the bike moving (by GPS and by accelerometer).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we had a lot of hardware troubles and couldn&rsquo;t finish anything substantial by the time the hackathon was over. We still had a lot of fun!</p>

<p>I think a lot of our time was wasted commuting from the dorms (which one of my teammates suggested as a workspace) to the food areas for meals. It was pretty far away so it took a while. Plus, who likes walking out in the snow? The food was worth it though.</p>

<p>Midnight pizza was my favourite. Since our trek was so long, we missed the pizza. It was only 12:15 am! The volunteers ordered more pizza but it mysteriously didn&rsquo;t come and they had to investigate. The worst 30 minutes of my life, I was starving. When they finally found it, all 20+ boxes of pizza were empty in literally minutes.</p>

<p>Hopefully next year I can participate again and hopefully have more to show for it.</p>

<h3 id="family-day">Family Day</h3>

<p>Monday was Family Day, a holiday here in Canada. My mom and my uncle were in the Philippines (my grandfather passed away and they were there for the funeral) so my brother, dad, my cousin, and I went out for dinner with just the four of us. We went to Blue Fin <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/im-stuffed/">again</a>. We ordered the deluxe menu this time, which automatically included lobsters. A little pricey at $38CAD per person but very worth it. We ate a little too much.</p>

Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you read hardcovers with the dust jacket on or off? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, I don&rsquo;t have a choice. A good number of books I read are from the library. If a hardcover has a dust jacket, it&rsquo;s gauranteed that the dust jacket is taped to the covers. Surprisingly, I don&rsquo;t find this uncomfortable at all and I pay little to no attention to it. I think it&rsquo;s because the dust jackets are also enveloped in clear plastic so it makes the jacket sturdy. Plus the tape keeps it from spontaneously falling off or bending.</p>

<p>If I do have the choice, I would rather read without the dust jacket. It&rsquo;s very awkward to hold with a dust jacket and I&rsquo;m constantly having to fiddle with it. I&rsquo;m also a little bit particular about the condition of my books and I would focus too much on not damaging the dust jacket. It&rsquo;s just too distracting to read a book with a dust jacket!</p>

<p>Now, if I&rsquo;m displaying my books on a bookshelf I&rsquo;m a little bit more torn.</p>

<p>I <em>love</em> how a bare hardcover book looks like on a shelf. There is something about the simplicity of the spine that just makes me so pleased. If I could, I would convert all of my books to hardcover just for those elegant spines.</p>

<p>However, if the book has a dust jacket, I would most likely keep the dust jacket on if it will be sitting on my shelf. As much as I enjoy pleasing aesthetics, I also value posterity. Where would I even put the dust jacket if I were to display the book without one? I couldn&rsquo;t ever bear to throw it away.</p>

<p>Reading a book without a dust jacket is a no brainer for me but displaying books without one is a dilemma.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A sprawling, genre-defying epic set in a dystopian metropolis plagued by dragons, this debut about what it’s like to be young in a very old world is pure storytelling pleasure</p>

<p>In the burned-out, futuristic city of Empire Island, three young people navigate a crumbling metropolis constantly under threat from a pair of dragons that circle the skies. When violence strikes, reality star Duncan Humphrey Ripple V, the spoiled scion of the metropolis’ last dynasty; Baroness Swan Lenore Dahlberg, his tempestuous, death-obsessed betrothed; and Abby, a feral beauty he discovered tossed out with the trash; are forced to flee everything they&rsquo;ve ever known. As they wander toward the scalded heart of the city, they face fire, conspiracy, mayhem, unholy drugs, dragon-worshippers, and the monsters lurking inside themselves. In this bombshell of a novel, Chandler Klang Smith has imagined an unimaginable world: scathingly clever and gorgeously strange, The Sky Is Yours is at once faraway and disturbingly familiar, its singular chaos grounded in the universal realities of love, family, and the deeply human desire to survive at all costs.</p>

<p><em>The Sky Is Yours</em> is incredibly cinematic, bawdy, rollicking, hilarious, and utterly unforgettable, a debut that readers who loved <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, <em>Super Sad True Love Story</em>, and <em>Blade Runner</em> will adore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh man, where do I start with this book? This book is genuinely <em><strong>weird</strong></em> and I&rsquo;m still on the fence on whether or not this is a good thing.</p>

<h3 id="the-setting">The Setting</h3>

<p>The world that <em>The Sky is Yours</em> set in is no doubt a dystopia. Dragons circle the city which is rife with drug dealers and mercenary gangs. Despite having affluent areas, I couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine a city full of rubble. It&rsquo;s not glamorous by any stretch of imagination but it is also lacks any charm whatsoever. One of the characters described the city as a lost cause and I would pretty much agree with him.</p>

<h3 id="the-characters">The Characters</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, almost every single character is unlikable. There&rsquo;s Ripple, the sheltered rich boy who treats women horrible and is incredibly entitled. Abby, his girl toy for the majority of the book, is even more sheltered and uncivilized and the literal definition of a dumb blonde. His fiancee Swanee is just as annoying and entitled as he is. His parents are even worse and I swear they are devoid of any feeling at all. His mom is like a spitting image of Abby in that she is pretty much just a tool or trophy to the ones they love.</p>

<p>The only character that I genuinely enjoyed was surprisingly the villain, Eisenhower Sharkey (I think that&rsquo;s his name). He is a drug ring leader and killed the parents of Ripple and Swanee but Swanee falls for him and I really actually rooted for Sharkey. I mean, Sharkey fed Swanee&rsquo;s drug addiction but Ripple is so useless that I can&rsquo;t imagine why Swanee would ever go back to him.</p>

<h3 id="the-plot">The Plot</h3>

<p>The plot is so&hellip; Out there. A million things is happening at the same time. Some of the sub-plots definitely over stayed their welcome and made me skip through it just to get to the juicier bits.</p>

<p>The ending made absolutely zero sense to me and felt a little bit too convenient but I accepted it just so I could finish the book. Spoiler alert: Everything turned out great and the city began to thrive again. Hmm. Okay. Alright. I was just glad it all ended.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m being a little harsh here. I actually did enjoy this book once I got over the overall weirdness of <strong>everything</strong> in the book. Honestly, this book is not to be taken seriously. It reminds me of Libba Bray&rsquo;s <em>Beauty Queens</em> which is equally outrageous and equally silly and probably intentionally so. The writing is also dreadfully <em>ok</em>. There are good nuggets here and there, especially when Smith goes into exposition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this gets a <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> for me. I would only recommend this to people who I&rsquo;d know would like this. I can&rsquo;t think of anyone at the moment but I know they exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever found yourself acting like a favorite character in a novel? If so, which one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all! The only time I find myself acting like anyone other than myself is if I&rsquo;m acting like my friends as a result of months of exposure to their quirks and traits. I rarely spend that much time with a character, even if I&rsquo;m reading a series.</p>

<p>There have been times when I thought to myself, &ldquo;I wish I could act like that character&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wish I could be more like that character&rdquo; but I rarely act on it. If I do, it&rsquo;s usually more of a universal trait rather than a specific trait that makes a character unique. For example, sometimes I wish I was as brave as some characters. But many characters are brave and they are hardly unique for being so. In conclusion, the answer is no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For fifty years, National Book Award winner Ursula K. Le Guin’s stories have shaped the way her readers see the world. Her work gives voice to the voiceless, hope to the outsider, and speaks truth to power. Le Guin’s writing is witty, wise, both sly and forthright; she is a master craftswoman.</p>

<p>This two-volume selection of almost forty stories taken from her eleven collections was made by Le Guin herself, as was the organizing principle of splitting the stories into the nominally realistic and fantastic.</p>

<p>Where on Earth focuses on Le Guin’s interest in realism and magic realism and includes eighteen of Le Guin’s satirical, political, and experimental earthbound stories.</p>

<p>Highlights include World Fantasy and Hugo Award winner “Buffalo Gals, Won’t You Come Out Tonight,” the rarely reprinted satirical short, “The Lost Children,” Jupiter Award winner, “The Diary of the Rose,” and the title story of her Pulitzer Prize finalist collection Unlocking the Air.</p>

<p>Stories in this volume were originally published in venues as varied as Playboy, TriQuarterly, Orbit, Redbook, and The New Yorker.</p>

<p>Companion volume Outer Space Inner Lands includes Le Guin’s best known nonrealistic stories. Both volumes include new introductions by the author.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love Ursula K. Le Guin. I <a href="(http://edelgrace.me/blog/inspiration-from-fictional-worlds)">wrote a post</a> about just how much she sparks my imagination and makes my insides tingle. I really enjoy her science fiction and I haven&rsquo;t read any of her &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; fiction. This is where the books title originates. <em>The Unreal and the Real</em> is a two volume anthology of Le Guin&rsquo;s short stories. The first volume, <em>Where on Earth</em>, is a collection of stories that do not have any science fiction elements in them.</p>

<p>This volume was actually a hit or miss on a couple of the stories. I can barely remember most of them however the ones that stuck out in my mind were: <em>Brothers and Sisters</em>; <em>Buffalo Gals, Won&rsquo;t You Come out Tonight</em>; and <em>Half Past Four</em>.</p>

<h3 id="half-past-four">Half Past Four</h3>

<p>I had already read this short story before. I own the book, <em>Unlock the Air and Other Stories</em>. The first time I read it, I was wholly confused. There were mini stories in this one story and the same characters were in each story. It seemed like their circumstances were different in each of the stories.</p>

<p>The introduction in <em>Where on Earth</em> really put the story in perspective. They were all separate and distinct stories despite having all the same characters. This was inspired from writing exercise Le Guin taught a class of poets: write a story about people with varying positions of authority.</p>

<p>Knowing the whole story now made me appreciate it much more. I don&rsquo;t know which mini-story I preferred the most. I liked how each story kept the main traits of the characters and it seemed to actually add to their personalities. It was interesting knowing how each character would act in different circumstances and relationships with each other.</p>

<p>Essentially there are four characters: Ella, Ann, Todd, and Stephen.</p>

<p>Ella is a woman who is either Ann&rsquo;s mother, step-mother, or sister. Ann is pregnant or a new mother and a sister to Todd or Ella or Stephen&rsquo;s daughter. Todd is Stephen&rsquo;s step-son or Ella&rsquo;s brother or Ella&rsquo;s son. Stephen is Ann&rsquo;s father or Ella&rsquo;s brother or the neighbour. It&rsquo;s all very complicated when I explain it like this but it&rsquo;s actually easy to keep track of.</p>

<h3 id="buffalo-gals-won-t-you-come-out-tonight">Buffalo Gals, Won&rsquo;t You Come Out Tonight</h3>

<p>This story was very different but also very Le Guin at the same time. A child survives a plane crash in the middle of the desert and is adopted by animals. These animals can talk and take the appearances of humans but are still very much animals. I love how Le Guin can capture the characteristics of these animals in a humanized way. For example, Coyote, is a wild and brash character, not unlike a real coyote. The animal society in the desert is also extremely fascinating.</p>

<h3 id="brothers-and-sisters">Brothers and Sisters</h3>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because <em>Brothers and Sisters</em> was the first story that I remember it very well. This is a story of two brothers, one pretty exceptional and the other a dreamer. Of course, in the middle of them is a girl. I was quite pleased with the outcome and while I grew to dislike some of the characters, I couldn&rsquo;t fault them for their personalities.</p>

<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>

<p>I liked this book quite a bit. There were some stories that I didn&rsquo;t particularly care for unfortunately but I enjoyed it nevertheless. I would give this book a solid <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. Le Guin is great with her words and I would recommend it to people who don&rsquo;t expect her science fiction. I think in the end I prefer her fantasy/sci-fi works.</p>
