        <p><strong>Warning: Spoilers for both <em>Life is Strange Season 1</em> and *Life is Strange: Before the Storm</strong>*</p>

<p>In <em>Life is Strange Season 1</em>, Racher Amber is a mystery. If you walk around and talk to the locals, everyone (including those with less than stellar personalities) has nothing to say but praises about Rachel. Throughout the game, Rachel is built up to be perfect to everyone you speak to. The artists loved to try to capture her essence, the nerds enjoyed her intellectual prowess, and the popular kids enjoyed partying it up with her. But even to those who knew her, there was an element of mystery surrounding Rachel. She kept up a certain distance from everyone but was still able to draw people in with her personality.</p>

<p>Understandably, this made me excited and a little bit nervous for Rachel&rsquo;s portrayal in the prequel, <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em>. Who was this person who was able to seduce all of Arcadia Bay and put all these diverse personalities under her spell?</p>

<p>Once Rachel made her first appearance in the series, it was a little overwhelming. She stepped into frame and I immediately thought, &ldquo;This is looks like a kid trying to look like a grownup.&rdquo; There stood Rachel Amber, all dolled up in thick eyeliner and a gothic outfit that looks like it should intimidate and be edgy but is a little awkward on her small frame. She was a fifteen year old looking to impress and rebel. Not so different from Chloe who was doing the same thing but Rachel&rsquo;s execution was more loud and dramatic. Rachel definitely had the flair for the dramatic.</p>

<p>In the first episode, Rachel brings Chloe along in her adventure to catch her dad cheating. However, Rachel doesn&rsquo;t tell Chloe this. When Rachel sees what she clearly doesn&rsquo;t want to see, her mood shifts drastically. This was when my red flags started going up. Rachel becomes immediately non-communicative. She then attemps to steal a wine bottle from a couple (wether or not she&rsquo;s successful is up to you). Another red flag. Here is a teenager who is already drowning her sorrows in alcohol and at the expense of stealing.</p>

<p>When they move into the junkyard, Rachel&rsquo;s sour mood continues. She throws insults and blames on Chloe when Chloe tries to decipher what was going on with Rachel. They quickly make up at the end of the day and Rachel confesses that the couple kissing in the park was her dad and a woman who was definitely not her mom. Her reaction is burn a photo of her and her dad in a trash can and knock it over, causing a raging forest fire.</p>

<p>From the start, Rachel Amber is complex and volatile. She is unpredictable and a beautiful liar.</p>

<p>What hurts the most about Rachel is that she is a perfectly flawed teenager. There is nothing more romantically tragic about someone trying to make their mark in the world in the most risky ways possible. Her end is even more tragic.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the end of <em>Before the Storm</em> that I felt a lot sorrow for Rachel. She was extremely firey and full of life. She had big dreams and wishes and regrets. And then everything ended before she could even have the chance to really live.</p>

<p>On one hand, I&rsquo;m a little glad they gave us such a short snippet of Rachel&rsquo;s life. It really hammered down the fact that life can be so brief. So while Rachel&rsquo;s story is tragic, it&rsquo;s not so removed from reality. That&rsquo;s why I really like the <em>Life is Strange</em> series. Despite the obvious embellishments, it&rsquo;s pretty down to earth and the characters make everything worth it. Some people may dismiss it as a game but it&rsquo;s still great medium of storytelling. I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>

<p>I read a lot of genres and therefore my blog reflects that. So yes, I have an eclectic blog! When I pick books to read, I don&rsquo;t consciously pick something by the genre. I think I tend to read a lot of memoirs, historical fiction, and romance. Lately I&rsquo;ve been on a fantasy binge. Really, I don&rsquo;t know if there is a genre I would <strong>not</strong> read and then blog about!</p>

        </div>

        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This post contains spoilers, and mentions of death and sex. You have been warned!</p>

<p>This year my SO introduced me to <em>Westworld</em>, a TV series that recently had their first (and last?) season end. Westworld is a highly advanced Western theme park populated with extremely life-like robots that cater to every want of their guests. It is rife of violence, alcohol, sex, and whatever you could imagine in the wild West. One of the founders of the park boasted that the park was able to let the guests find their true selves.</p>

<p>However, not everything is as delicately planned and controlled as one would hope. Some of the hosts go haywire and the line between humans and hosts become blurred.</p>

<p>There were several things that have surprised me about this show, mainly all the plot twists. The main one being (again, spoiler alert) that one of the employees at the park is, in fact, a robot himself. He had been created in the likeness of one of the deceased park&rsquo;s creators and the partner of the current surviving park creator. When this was revealed, it blew my mind. I had already read a theory on Reddit that this character was a host but I thought the commenter were just reading too much into it. Turns out, they were right!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m conflicted about this. I read this theory after watching episode two of the season. Does this mean that this was too predictable and the writing inadequate? If I had never read that theory, I never would have guessed. Thankfully, I dismissed the theory as being too &ldquo;out there&rdquo; and was still incredibly surprised with the big reveal.</p>

<p>Despite this, I still found it to be a pretty interesting and compelling series. The acting in it is superb and it is visually stunning. I hear that might be a second season of <em>Westworld</em> and I am looking forward to it wholeheartedly!</p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>My last semester was extremely busy. So busy that I spent my commute on the train sleeping everyday instead of my usual reading. I&rsquo;ll admit, most of my reading is done when I&rsquo;m on the train. So other than the occasional manga or cookbook, I hardly read the last couple months of last year. Which is devastating.</p>

<p>This year (like every year), I resolved to read more. I started out the year reading two non-fictional books about personal finance. Good insightful content but hardly stimulating.</p>

<p>On impulse, I was at the library paying fines (my water bottle exploded in my backpack and ruined a book, I&rsquo;m still a bit peeved) when I saw <em>Emily of New Moon</em> by L. M. Montgomery on the shelf. I had just finished watching <em>Anne</em> on Netflix and I needed another dosage of Montgomery goodness.</p>

<p>Reading through <em>Emily of New Moon</em> struck something within me. Whenever I read good literature, I always have an urge to write. I know that I will never be as good as the authors that inspire me, but most of the time I just want to write for the sake of posterity.</p>

<p>In <em>Emily of New Moon</em>, the main character (you guessed it, Emily) writes letters to her father as a sort of journaling mechanism. This made me long for my journal. I have tried writing journals many times but my anxiety of my mother reading my journal has made me hesitate each time. I see this blog as a sort of journal but I still have to censor myself as this is (obviously) public. I do admire those who can freely write in their blogs but it&rsquo;s hard for me to take that step especially since many of my thoughts are so personal.</p>

<p>Reading about this little girl writing so freely made me envious. I started to write a little more in a notebook.</p>

<p>Then I heard about the passing of Ursula K. Le Guin. It&rsquo;s been around a year since I first stumbled upon <em>A Fisherman of the Inland Sea.</em> I was completely enamored by the book. When I was younger, I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy. Things like <em>Dragon Rider</em> by Cornelia Funke, <em>The Old Kingdom</em> series by Garth Nix, <em>Harry Potter</em> (of course), <em>The Last Dragon Chronicles</em> by Chris d&rsquo;Lacey, etc. There was something about being immersed in a totally fictional and supernatural world that I found captivating.</p>

<p>Le Guin is a master at creating such worlds, although she tends towards science fiction rather than fantasy (in my opinion). Her world building is expansive and natural and oh so imaginative (I picture Anne of Green Gables saying a similar thing with her eyes wide and her hands clasped).</p>

<p>Two of my friends are currently taking a science fiction course where they will eventually read Le Guin&rsquo;s <em>The Left Hand of Darkness.</em> I&rsquo;ve read a couple of Le Guin&rsquo;s books (mostly compilations of her short stories) but haven&rsquo;t touched any of her more popular novels. Thanks to the power of Audible, I managed to get a free copy of the audiobook.</p>

<p>However, listening to Le Guin&rsquo;s words just isn&rsquo;t the same as reading them. Maybe it was the narrator but I couldn&rsquo;t get myself into it. There was one scene that I could pay attention to but when it came to the description of politics and the general world, I couldn&rsquo;t focus.</p>

<p>So I made a trip to my local library to scout for some more of her books. <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> is a popular book and the wait-list for it was thirty people long so I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be reading that any time soon. But I did manage to pick up one of her books that were decidedly not science-fiction, <em>The Unreal and the Real: Volume One: Where on Earth.</em></p>

<p>I had barely read through the introduction and the first sentence of the first chapter when I put the book down. I instinctively shivered and got out my notebook to essentially write most of what I have already written here. It was a special moment. Le Guin had captured me entirely.</p>

<p>In a way, I&rsquo;m jealous at how beautifully Le Guin seems to string along her sentences. I&rsquo;ve never really had a way with words, especially if they come out of my mouth. I have to think slowly and carefully and even in the written form, I&rsquo;m not as eloquent as I wish I could be.</p>

<p>Even though I could never hope to be a master of words like Le Guin and Montgomery, I can imagine. I can spin tales in my head and conjure up these characters that seem real to me. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to capture their essence in the written form but at least they&rsquo;re something that I&rsquo;ve created. I think having an imagination is a wonderful thing. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve imagined anything and I&rsquo;m glad that reading has started my mind up again.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These are my own opinions of these restaurants, this post is <strong><em>not</em></strong> sponsored!</p>

<p>This weekend was a very filling one. Each day I was eating something yummy, somewhere!</p>

<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>

<p>My brother and my cousin went to <a href="https://www.bluefinsushiab.com/">Blue Fin Sushi</a>. They have an all you can eat lunch pretty cheaply for $17.84 CAD. No limits or anything! I was supposed to go with them last week but I ended up missing it. Last week my cousin ate so much he threw up. I took that as a good sign that they wouldn&rsquo;t skimp out on the food.</p>

<p>So my brother and cousin suggested to go again and I could finally go with them! I had been waiting for this lunch the entire week. I definitely did not push myself to the point of throwing up but I did eat enough to feel considerably full. I could have powered through one more order but it is a lot of sushi!</p>

<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>

<p>My birthday was last December. I originally planned for a lunch but the weather was extremely bad. It snowed quite a lot and the roads were terrible for driving. So I cancelled it and then rescheduled! Unfortunately not everyone could make it still but still had good attendance.</p>

<p>The person who couldn&rsquo;t make it was the person we were counting on guiding us through the menu since he&rsquo;s been there a couple of times. I decided on going to <a href="http://www.moonkoreanbbq.com/">Moon Korean BBQ</a> because I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but rave reviews about it from my friends. It was the cutest little restaurant. The decor was minimalistic but also homely with some Korean pop music going on in the background.</p>

<p>They even had the cutest cutlery sets!</p>

<p>Anyway, we ended up just getting the all you can eat menu. We had a two hour time limit of 10 different items per round. We ate a lot of meat and opted for grilling our food ourselves (but not without some handholding from our server).</p>

      <figcaption><h4>Meat grilling on the table</h4>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>The food was absolutely delicious. I wish I remembered to buy cheesecake for dessert though. 10 out of 10, would eat again!</p>

<h2 id="sunday">Sunday</h2>

<p>Sunday was much less glamorous. My cousin had coupons for Taco Time and we just went and bought burritos. I bought a beef and cheese burrito and, man, it is a lot of meat. I could not finish it and felt full for the rest of the day. We also went to buy timbits for a snack afterwards.</p>

<p>There was a Goodwill nearby and we decided to drop in. I&rsquo;ve never been there before and wanted to see what was there. There were a bunch of cheap tea sets that made me think of <em>Moon Korean BBQ</em>. I know where I will shop for my dishes and such for when I move out!</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>

<p>This weekend was really nice! I spent too much money and calories on food, however. I&rsquo;m hoping to cut down on all this food from this point forward.</p>
