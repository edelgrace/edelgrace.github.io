        <p>Last week we got our yearbooks from last year. I dislike the fact that they give it out in the new school year since not all of those who graduated can come back and sign the yearbooks of those who were left behind. But I guess it takes a while to get all of the pictures, design each of the pages, send it to the company, physically make it, and then ship it back to us. Still, I wish they give it earlier.</p>

<p>Anyway, my TA (my homeroom teacher) were giving out the yearbooks and she smelled each one of them saying, &ldquo;It smells like highschool.&rdquo; When a couple of us laughed at her, she said, &ldquo;No really! Ten years later from now, you&rsquo;ll take it off your shelf, and think that it smells like high school.&rdquo; Not many of us were convinced.</p>

<p>Does high school have a smell? When I think about it, the only smell I can think of is the jock hallway smell. Sweat and stinky uniforms. Yuck. I know people in high school who have a distinct smell but it doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone smells like that. I don&rsquo;t even know. Did your high school have a distinct smell?</p>

<p>On another note, diplomas are coming up soon. Okay, in 63 days, but I&rsquo;m going to start studying now. I think the Alberta government basically screws us over with the diplomas. We&rsquo;re one of the only provinces in the country who have diplomas and if a province does have diplomas, it&rsquo;s not worth 50% of their mark like ours.</p>

<p>Some people in the government try to justify it by saying it forces kids to study. There are people who never study at all and do great. There are people who study their butts off for weeks and don&rsquo;t pass. It doesn&rsquo;t help us at all. It&rsquo;s too much stress, especially since it contributes to the marks that universities and colleges look at. Not all universities in the world acknowledge the fact that we have diplomas that can seriously skew our marks (except for Saskatchewan but who wants to go there?). I think it&rsquo;s good to have high expectations but sometimes it&rsquo;s too high for most people to achieve.</p>

<p>As you can tell, I really hate diplomas.</p>

        <p>I never finished the DIR EN GREY meme. I’ll finish it sooner or later. I haven’t posted in a while either. Oh no! Well, better late than never.</p>

<p>I rediscovered this podcast I downloaded when I just started listening to Japanese and Korean music. All Rock and No Talk by xxthrowdownxx I think it was. So yeah, I was listening to volume 12 and came across a pleasant gem.</p>

<p><em>Stand By Me</em> by The Brilliant Green. The Brilliant Green is a pop rock band fronted by Tomoko Kawase. Tomoko Kawase is most known for (or so I would think) her solo project, Tommy February6 or Tommy Heavenly6.</p>

<p>The first time I listened to her would either be in the Nana OST or in the podcast all those years ago.</p>

<p>When I was in love with L’Arc~en~Ciel, I used to go on a forum called Dive to Blue. There they shared many music and this one album featured Tetsu69, the bassist of the band. This album was a Nana tribute. Also on the album was Skye Sweetman and Tommy February6. I don’t remember what song Tommy sang. <em>Hey Bad Boy</em>? Or was that the song on the podcast? I’ll have to check. Either way, that was my first song by her.</p>

<p>Just recently, I rediscovered her though the anime <em>Paradise Kiss</em> (from the creator of <em>Nana</em>). She sang the opening which was <em>Lonely in Gorgeous</em>. The song ran shivers down my spine. It was sultry, catchy, reminiscent of 80s pop, and the lyrics were practically made for the anime. Yeah, I listened to that for a long while.</p>

<p>But I <strong>rere</strong>discovered her like yesterday or so through the podcast. The Brilliant Green. The song <em>Stand By Me</em> is amazing. Tomoko’s voice is absolutely heavenly. It’s so pure. I love it.</p>

<p>So I searched for more Tomoko. <em>Magic in Your Eyes</em> was the one that stood out the most from my findings. I’ve listened to it before but it never stuck to me until now. The very first few seconds aren’t that amazing but filled with wonderful Engrish. “Come on darling close your eyes.” The bridge or chorus isn’t that great either. “Call in, if you’re my boyfriend x1000.” But the verses were absolutely HEAVENLY.</p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s my weekend in a nutshell: lazy and wonderful. I did almost nothing and I loved it. Too bad this is the last long weekend until Christmas break. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll hold out until then. So, here&rsquo;s a slightly more detailed view of my weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday:</strong></p>

<p>Woke up early for my dentist appointment. My mom still makes me go to a pediatric dentist because I’m not yet an adult, haha. I was told that I have nice teeth yet I have cavities and I need my wisdom teeth pulled out. Ouch. Also, the assistant dentist asked if I was in grade eleven and I dumbly said yes, thinking I was still in grade eleven.</p>

<p><strong>Friday:</strong></p>

<p>Got my friend to change my password for Tumblr so that I don’t procrastinate anymore. I still procrastinate.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday:</strong></p>

<p>Told myself I would finish my homework. I finished my fanlisting collective, a fanlisting, and worked on my book log. Productive procrastination, yay!</p>

<p><strong>Sunday:</strong></p>

<p>Went to church, joined a Tumblr guild on Neopets, talked to the people there for a good two hours, and got someone to sell me a Christmas paint brush for half price. I proceeded to paint Eluxus (my kougra) Christmas. One dreamie pet down, two to go! Also, I favourited a gazillion songs on YouTube. Then I finished my homework. Okay, I didn’t finish it but I have spare first period so I’ll just do it then.</p>

<p>I hope everyone else had a good long weekend as well!</p>

        <p>I understand that it is almost Thanksgiving in the States so others have long weekends as well. But our reasons for the long weekend are because of parent teacher interviews tomorrow and Rememberance day the after.</p>

<p>Speaking of Rememberance day, today was the Rememberance celebration at my school. Since I go to a Catholic school, the celebration is held at the church behind the school. It&rsquo;s a short walk across the field and into the parking lot but it was chilly. There was snow on the ground but not really, so that&rsquo;s always a plus.</p>

<p>The actual celebration was decent. The drama kids put on a homily/mini play. It&rsquo;s really cheesy, especially with Rememberance day. A lot of guns and dying. But my one friend, who has a very exuberant personality was narrating half of it and she did a wonderful job. She made me tear up!</p>

<p>Also, I always feel some sort of emotion when they do the role call of those who died in war. Seeing all those people stand up and pin a poppy onto the cross when someone they know is called is somehow heartbreaking. Yeah, that was my highlight of my day.</p>

<p>I got 93% on my math midterm! It was so easy, and I&rsquo;m just so happy right now. Omg. But. Physics always ruin my day. However, we&rsquo;re learning about centripical force and my teacher did a demo with a bucket full of water and swung it around with a string. It didn&rsquo;t spill (well duh) but the string broke the the bucket went flying. Chemistry was blah because we wrote a quiz on ice tables and I blanked. We also had a substitute so it was just a work period. On the bus, me and marie talked about jobs and scholarship. Quite exciting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that is it for today. Goodnight!</p>

        <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This was queued to be posted on Halloween. But I accidentally queued it for Halloween&hellip; LAST YEAR. *facepalm* Better late than never.</p>

<p>My iPod&rsquo;s broken. AHHHHHHHHH! I do most of my surfing, blog commenting, and posting on my iPod because I don&rsquo;t have access to my laptop most days. My parents only give me the laptop when I can whole heartedly prove to them that I have homework to do on the laptop. So I haven&rsquo;t been posting or anything for a while. I have been updating my Twitter and Tumblr on my phone but I can&rsquo;t go on any other websites unless I want a gigantic bill at the end of the month. Ah, whatever. Right now I&rsquo;ve finished all my homework and I&rsquo;m rushing to finish this post. Oh no, rushing is never good but forgive me.</p>

<p>So last week, I went to Screamfest for the very first time with my friends. Screamfest is an annual Halloween event where people 16+ have a good excuse to scare people who paid money to get scared. My friends have been asking me to go for the past four years but every year my parents have said no. Finally, they said yes this year. I kinda used the &ldquo;this will be our last halloween together before we all go away for university&rdquo; and I think it worked.</p>

<p>On our way to Screamfest, there was major traffic. Then my dad missed the turn to go into the venue. I kinda laughed at him as we tried to find an exit to bring us back to the intersection. When we finally got there, my dad dropped me off, we got our tickets, and we went in.</p>

<p>Screamfest is held at COP, the Canada Olympic Park in my city. It&rsquo;s a rather large place. During the winter people would ski down the hills and such. There&rsquo;s this section of the park that is reserved for things like sledding or more accuratley, luging. The entrace to the actual event was under the luging track and it definitely set the mood. It was dark and the stairs were creaky. Once you emerged from the mini-tunnel, there was a 5 minute walk along a path with mostly trees. We were walking and then this hooded guy dressed as grim reaper jumped out at us. We saw him and we knew he was coming but we screamed anyway.</p>

<p>We heard the loud thumping of a song and we knew we were close. We walked down another set of stairs to be greeted by a large group kids, a tent, a large bon fire, and a couple of those fair like haunted trailers. Screamfest staff walked around in their costumes, coming up behind people and scaring them. The chainsaw guy (we affectionately called him that the whole evening) stood on the fence that divided the lines for the trailers and waved his chainsaw in the air. It was a sight to see. And it was cold.</p>

<p>First we walked into the tent. It was really warm in there and there were strobe lights everywhere. Inside the tent were booths. Game booths, t-shirt booths, and (to much of my delight) comic book booths. Marie went to grab some grub and me and Sam looked around. There was a hot shirtless guy dressed as an angel holding up t-shirts. He was hot but I felt absolutely cold looking at him. How could he be shirtless in such a cold city??</p>

<p>After Marie finished her hot dog, we walked out of the tent and watched a couple performers on the mini stage. Most of them involved fire. A lady danced with a fire hula hoop and another lady had fire fans. It was interesting but we got bored quickly. We stood around for a bit and checked our phones. I put mine away and looked at the ground. Suddenly Marie said &ldquo;Oh hello,&rdquo; over her shoulder. I looked behind expecting someone we knew but instead this guy caked with skull makeup, piercings, and spiked up hair was staring at me. It was freaky but I then concluded that he was a bit hot looking. After he left, we went back to staring at our feet. Then Sam suggested we go into a haunted house.</p>

<p>The first one we went to was 3D. OMG 3D. They gave us 3D glasses, haha. And it was clown themed too. It wasn&rsquo;t that scary but I refused to be the first one inside. There was a few moments when me, Marie, and Sam fought over who would go first. It was fun.</p>

<p>We stood a while around the clown house when that scary yet hot skull boy came back. He walked up to me and stared. It was scary than the first time because I noticed his contacts. They were like glow in the dark green. And not cool glow in the dark green but like white that glows faintly green in the dark. Then he took a step forward and I stepped back. But then he turned hot again and licked his lips. He just had to go and ruin the illusion. I enjoyed being scared.</p>

<p>Then we went into another haunted house. It wasn&rsquo;t that scary and Marie and Sam forced me to go first. And so I did. It was really dark and I had no idea where to go. Thankfully there was a couple in front of us and we sheepishly followed them.</p>

<p>After we emerged from the house, the skull guy creeped behind us again. And twelve year old girls were hitting on him. And taking pictures of him. Lol.</p>

<p>Soon after, some of my other friends came. We stood in line for the maze. I was feeling really queasy because the smell of the smoke doesn&rsquo;t agree with me. We waited in line for a looooong time and I just wanted to puke. I kept it down but just as we entered the maze, my dad called me saying that he was waiting for me in the parking lot. So I basically ran through the maze clinging onto Luke&rsquo;s shirt. Luke is a scardycat but after the maze he said that he felt manly because I was clinging on to him for the whole time. Is that a compliment or&hellip;?</p>

<p>After that I went home. It was fun. Definitely going again next year!</p>
