<p>To many readers, who have perhaps known Frankenstein only at second hand, the original may well come as a surprise. When Mary Shelley began it, she was only eighteen, though she was already Shelley&rsquo;s mistress and Byron&rsquo;s friend. In her preface she explains how she and Shelley spent part of a wet summer with Byron in Switzerland, amusing themselves by reading and writing ghost stories. Her contribution was Frankenstein, a story about a student of natural philosophy who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from bones he has collected in charnel-houses. The story is not a study of the macabre, as such, but rather a study of how man uses his power, through science, to manipulate and pervert his own destiny, and this makes it a profoundly disturbing book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shelley is a lot like her mother. They both love characters who talk and talk and talk.</p>

<p>Honestly, I did not expect most of what happened in this book. Everyone &ldquo;knows&rdquo; the Frankenstein story: mad scientist raises the undead in a creepy laboratory in the mountains during a thunderstorm. It usually seems to end there. Some variations, Frankenstein actually makes a &ldquo;female&rdquo; version and, usually, the female doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with its male counterpart.</p>

<p>However, I learned that Frankenstein is much more than that. It&rsquo;s a lot more gruesome and morbid than I thought it would be. I wouldn&rsquo;t really classify it as horrifying in any way. Honestly, I was a bit bored by many parts of it. I sympathized with Frankenstein&rsquo;s creation when he told his tale but it was still hard for me to picture him as anything but human.</p>

<p>I will say that I enjoyed how Shelley utilized the unreliable narrator. I can&rsquo;t believe sitting down with someone while they recounted a story as long as this.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I read it and got it out of the way but I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the book itself. I don&rsquo;t want to say &ldquo;it was okay&rdquo; AKA 2 stars because that implies there was something good about the book. Not to say there&rsquo;s anything bad but it just wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I follow the blog baty.net in which Jack Baty continuously finds new tools and new ways to improve his productivity. While I usually scoff at people who are always changing things up, I will admit that I am the exact same way. It would be great to just stick to something tried and true and never have to think about changing but there is just so much out there that it&rsquo;s hard for me to resist the temptation to not try everything I can see.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">FO stands for &ldquo;finished object.&rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!

Since I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</div>

It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&rsquo;t win anything from but that&rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&rsquo;s great!</div>

Up to this point I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Honestly, Stampede is synonymous with food for me. Stampede means free breakfasts for a week. Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&rsquo;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</div>
