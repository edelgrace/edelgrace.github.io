      <title>Kuzu no Honkai: On Using Others</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: There is spoilers for the entire anime and (presumably) manga. Mentions of mature themes such as sexual content is also included.
Now that classes have ended and I&amp;rsquo;m unemployed, I am taking it a little bit slow with my free time. I recently started on working a new afghan square for the month of July and watching various movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime. I stumbled across Kuzu no Honkai and while the synopsis made me skeptical, I decided to give it a shot.</description>

      <description>I only have one link today, that&amp;rsquo;s the blog Altair &amp;amp; Vega.
Altair &amp;amp; Vega is an extremely insightful blog that delves deep into the narrative and art of many popular anime and manga titles. They have a group of multiple authors and while their posts aren&amp;rsquo;t regular, when they do show up on my news feed, it&amp;rsquo;s a great treat.
I forget how I originally got to this site. I probably stumbled upon it through the post on the anime Hyouka, &amp;ldquo;And You Don&amp;rsquo;t Doubt Your Own?</description>

      <description>Ugh I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible.
 I had a dream where I literally just lived out my entire day, down to sitting in lecture being bored and taking notes.
You donâ€™t even know how disappointed I am when I woke up knowing that I had to do it all over again.</description>

      <title>I Started to Play TCGs Again</title>

      <description>Since I gave up Tumblr for Lent, I realized how much free time I had on my hands without Tumblr. I decided, why not get back into TCGs? And so I did.
TCG stands for &amp;ldquo;Trading Card Game.&amp;rdquo; There are TCGs around the Internet that you can join as long as you yourself have a bit of space on the Internet. The goal of the game is basically to collect all the cards that are available in the game.</description>

      <description>Man, this was the most productive week I&amp;rsquo;ve had since Reading Week! I&amp;rsquo;m super happy with my level of productivity. I got a lot done and I still managed to have a large amount of free time all to myself. On Tuesday, I got to hang out with a friend for two hours and I still got stuff done.
On Thursday, I went on a Kill la Kill marathon. My friends have been bugging me about watching it and since the finale was Thursday night, I spent the entire day catching up on the series.</description>
