<blockquote>
<p><em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> was the first novel to split the atom. If the novel before <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> aspired to immensities of scope and scale, to heroic journeys across vast landscapes, with <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> Virginia Woolf insisted that it could also locate the enormous within the everyday; that a life of errands and party-giving was every bit as viable a subject as any life lived anywhere; and that should any human act in any novel seem unimportant, it has merely been inadequately observed. The novel as an art form has not been the same since.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I picked up <em>The Hours</em> one day at the library. I did not know what it was about when I started reading it, and it captured me immediately. The scene of Woolf at the water&rsquo;s edge, the stones in her pocket, made my heart drop. As I read on, I realized this was, essentially, a crossover with <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>. I hadn&rsquo;t read <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> yet. So, even though I loved <em>The Hours</em> up to that point, I put it down so as not to spoil myself.</p>

<p>Finally, years later, I finished <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>.</p>

<p>This was a hard book to read. I actually had gotten a copy of the audiobook from Audible (no, this post is not sponsored by Audible) and while listening to it, I knew I could not <strong>just</strong> listen to it, I needed to devour these words on a page. I put out a hold on the book at the library and eagerly started reading right away. However, it was incredibly hard for me to read. I would read a paragraph and not know what exactly was happening.</p>

<p>Annette Brownings, the narrator of the audiobook, breathed so much life into Woolf&rsquo;s words that I ended up listening to the audiobook while I read the physical book. That could be why it took me so long to read this book. But it was a very interesting way to read it. I find that when I listen to audiobooks, my mind can tend to wander. While reading, sometimes I will have to reread sentences before they make sense. Reading and listening at the same time really anchored me and I was able to focus.</p>

<p>And it was great that I was able to focus on it. The characters in <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> absolutely grabbed me. I have never loved a cast of characters more. They are all so inexplicably human. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to grow old as I&rsquo;m still pretty young but I could <strong>feel</strong> these things that the characters went through, were going through.</p>

<p>Woolf has a wonderful way of narrating, it seems a lot like casual conversation. Quirky enough that you could spot a Woolf novel a mile away. I adored it, plain and simple (I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s one of her quirky isms and I&rsquo;m taking it!). Woolf understands life. She suffered through it. I am so glad that she left the world with her words for us to muse and contemplate over. How intriguing it is, how one can leave behind a legacy.</p>

<p><em>If anybody could have saved me it would have been you.</em></p>

Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you take notes about the book you are reading as you read?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I only really do this for non-fiction books. Sometimes I take pictures of quotes that really stick out to me. One of these days I will actually capture these quotes and compile them into one place.</p>

<p>Maybe I should be writing notes while I read a book. I do go through times where a book really makes me pause and I think about the contents for a good couple minutes. It&rsquo;s hard to do this though because most of the time, I read books when I&rsquo;m on the train. Whenever I&rsquo;m on the train, I never get a seat so I&rsquo;m always standing. I guess I could take notes on my phone instead.</p>

<p>For example, I was listening to an audiobook of Virginia Wool&rsquo;s <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> on the train and there were so many passages that just made me drift into wonderland. I haven&rsquo;t finished reading it yet (at the time of writing this) but I already know that this might be a book that will resonate with me. It would be nice to capture those thoughts in a timely manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ligget was precisely the sort of person who, if he hadn&rsquo;t married Emily, would be just the perfect person for Emily to snub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book captivated me. From the moment Gloria stepped on to the page, I was hooked. This young and feisty woman is surprisingly progressive for her time: sleeping around, smoking, staying up all hours of the night. She is your classic bad girl whom everyone has their eyes set upon her. Of course, this only ends in tragedy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a hopeless romantic so there is one scene in the entire book that stuck out the most Gloria and Eddie, two close friends, are on the verge of sleeping together. They are probably the most suited together out of all the possible combinations of Gloria and other men. Then, at that moment, Gloria sees Eddie as just another man who wants to get into her pants. Suddenly, the magic is lost. I find it tragic.</p>

<p>Gloria throws herself at men and declares love for men in a way that I totally do not understand. She says she would marry Ligget but I don&rsquo;t see the attraction or at least any evidence that Gloria would have any attraction to such a prospect. Does she just want to be comfortable with a somewhat wealthy man even if he&rsquo;s twice her age? On the other hand, Ligget is so weirdly obsessed with Gloria for what seems like just because she is young and daring and it&rsquo;s frankly tiring.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;m complaining, this makes for such a good story. I wanted to know everything. The ending was a bit disappointing but kudos for not making me see it coming until two paragraphs before. It&rsquo;s tragic.</p>

<p>Also, don&rsquo;t be fooled by Gloria being ahead of her time. This book is still a product of its time. It&rsquo;s rife with sexism and blatant racism. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if this was a modern take on the post-Depression era but the lack of sugarcoating on these things and the authenticity of the characters made me realize that O&rsquo;Hara is definitely from this time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is but American literature from the 30&rsquo;s/40&rsquo;s have a very golden-like quality to them. I can feel the hazy smoke in the bars, hear the jazzy swing music, see the dated cars. It&rsquo;s definitely such a prominent aesthetic that you just inherently know even if those things aren&rsquo;t all explicitly detailed.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d say I enjoyed this book.</p>

<p>Nope! I don&rsquo;t like spending money to take a chance on a book. These days I just go to the library so I don&rsquo;t have to risk my money on a book I might not like. So subscription boxes are definitely something that I am not interested in at all. Too risky. My tastes are also very particulaor. I tend to stick to authors I know and I&rsquo;m mostly focused on reading classics or well known and well revered books rather than anything new right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The suburbs of north London are an unlikely spot from which to witness the total breakdown of society, and yet in 1897-8 that is what happened—at least in the imagination of H.G. Wells. In <em>The War of the Worlds</em> Martians lands in Woking, and then make their way remorselessly towards the capital, wreaking chaos, death, and destruction. The novel echoes anxieties about a possible invasion of Great Britain at the turn of the century, and growing concerns about imperial expansion and its impact, while drawing on the latest astronomical knowledge to imagine a desert planet, Mars, turning to Earth for its future. The Martians are evolutionarily superior to mankind, and the fate of civilization remains in doubt until the final pages. Disturbingly realistic and peopled with believable characters, the novel exemplifies the mixture of scientific scepticism and vivid imagination that made Wells the father of modern science fiction.</p>

<p>This new edition and introduction examines the literary and social climate in which Wells wrote and lived, and contains notes on contemporary geographical and cultural references.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book was a pleasant surprise. I did not know what to expect from this book as I&rsquo;ve never watched the movie. What surprised me the most was how long ago this was written. It was written in the late 1800&rsquo;s. I never realized that. Growing up, I always thought this was written in the 30&rsquo;s or something like that. This just astounds me. It&rsquo;s incredible to me to think that H.G. Wells had so much imagination in the 1800&rsquo;s to think of such a story. Admittedly, I don&rsquo;t know how prevelant the concept of aliens are.</p>

<p>What really intrigued me about this book was how it ended. These huge giant Martian monsters are wiped out only due to their own biology not being able to cope with Earth&rsquo;s environment. I never saw that coming. When I think about it, it would be totally plausible. What I&rsquo;m surprised at is how the reverse didn&rsquo;t happen as well. Think about all the different bacteria and viruses on Mars!</p>

<p>Everything else about this book is very typical science fiction. Of course, there is the scene where a man loses his mind during the apocalypse. People are largely in disbelief during the onset of the invasion. Masses killings. The military trying their best and pretty much failing at killing aliens.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say this fell flat for me but it was a pretty average book. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the significance of it is lost on me. I can imagine this made a big splash back then. And H.G. Wells is a very good writer. Definitely worthy of being a classic!</p>
