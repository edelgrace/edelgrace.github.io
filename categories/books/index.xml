 Can you say this about yourself? Nothing makes me happier than sitting down with a good book.
 Not even close.
Some things that make as happy or happier:
 Eating really good food Having a meaningful conversation with a friend Sitting in the field in my father&amp;rsquo;s homeland looking up a starry sky Listening to a good song in the window seat of a train watching the city pass by Playing a video game and being absorbed in a virtual world Falling asleep to the sound of rain Singing along to my favourite songs Watching a good TV series that can make me sob Walking along the river on a sunny day Going to a concert Playing with really cute babies Dog spotting around the city Etc.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Spoilers abound!
  Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World by Haruki Murakami     Hyperkinetic and relentlessly inventive, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World is Haruki Murakami&amp;rsquo;s deep dive into the very nature of consciousness.
Across two parallel narratives, Murakami draws readers into a mind-bending universe in which Lauren Bacall, Bob Dylan, a split-brained data processor, a deranged scientist, his shockingly undemure granddaughter, and various thugs, librarians, and subterranean monsters collide to a dazzling effect.</description>

 Do you agree or disagree with this statement: A blogger&amp;rsquo;s first name should be in a prominent place on his/her blog.
 I definitely agree! Even if the name is an alias, putting a name to the blog can do wonders in making a blog feel more personable.</description>

 What&amp;rsquo;s your proudest blogging milestone or achievement?
 I think the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blog for so long is an achievement. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging since 2007, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for over ten years now. I remember blogging on a platform called Mibba.</description>

 Does a cluttered blog have you not returning? By cluttered I mean too many columns, small type, too many photos, difficult to follow, etc.
 Interestingly, I rarely visit blogs anymore. I only ever really visit a blog when a blog I am subscribed to pops up on my RSS reader and I feel compelled to comment on it.</description>

 If you were stranded on a deserted island, which ONE book could you not live without?
 OH MAN. This is such a hard question. Would I bring my favourite book, Vilette by Charlotte Brontë? I&amp;rsquo;ve only read it once, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I could read it more than a couple of times.</description>

 I do have an Instagram account! Shameless plug, @edelgraceme.
The people I follow are usually my friends. Sometimes I follow some comic artists because I enjoy some humor every now and then.</description>

 What author have you read the most in the past two years?
 Not including manga artists, that would by Ursula K. Le Guin.
I just happened to come across Le Guin by chance. I was itching to read some sci-fi but I was daunted by all the thick hardcover volumes at my local library.</description>

 What were your worst movies based off of books?
 WARNING: Spoilers for My Sister&amp;rsquo;s Keeper by Jodi Picoult.
When I go to see a movie based off a book, I don&amp;rsquo;t go in with high expectations. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Harry Potter nerd by any stretch of imagination so those movies didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me despite their departures from the source material.</description>

 Could you ever pick a favorite book or is it like choosing your favorite child?
 I don&amp;rsquo;t like comparing books to children. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible for me to be impartial to a book. Every book deserves to be judged, simply because it exists.</description>

 How do you organize your books for review? Does it work for you or have you had to change it?
 I just write reviews of books as I read them. No organization needed. Everything goes into one category: &amp;ldquo;Book&amp;rdquo; and then it gets the tag &amp;ldquo;review.</description>

      <description>BookDate has a weekly running event where we all post what we&amp;rsquo;re reading this week!
What I read Last Week I finally finished reading David Allen&amp;rsquo;s Getting Things Done! I&amp;rsquo;ve always heard about the infamous GTD method and finally decided to read the book. I am not sure if I want to write a review for it yet because I can&amp;rsquo;t really judge how well the process works before I actually implement it.</description>

      <description>The Unreal and the Real Volume One: Where on Earth     For fifty years, National Book Award winner Ursula K. Le Guin’s stories have shaped the way her readers see the world. Her work gives voice to the voiceless, hope to the outsider, and speaks truth to power. Le Guin’s writing is witty, wise, both sly and forthright; she is a master craftswoman.
This two-volume selection of almost forty stories taken from her eleven collections was made by Le Guin herself, as was the organizing principle of splitting the stories into the nominally realistic and fantastic.</description>

      <description>The Knitting Sutra     When Susan Gordon Lydon was coping with a broken arm, her craft took on new significance. While knitting was essential to strengthening her hands, it also provided her with a newfound sense of peace and creativity. Immersed in brilliant colors, textures, and images of beautiful sweaters, Lydon found healing and enlightenment in a way she had never imagined. Capturing this journey of discovery, The Knitting Sutra recounts her remarkable membership in a community of craftswomen around the world, from sweater makers in Scotland to Navajo weavers, and the adventures that her craft led her on.</description>

      <description>My last semester was extremely busy. So busy that I spent my commute on the train sleeping everyday instead of my usual reading. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, most of my reading is done when I&amp;rsquo;m on the train. So other than the occasional manga or cookbook, I hardly read the last couple months of last year. Which is devastating.
This year (like every year), I resolved to read more. I started out the year reading two non-fictional books about personal finance.</description>

      <description>Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &amp;#8216;plant-like&amp;rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&amp;rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</description>

      <description>After thirty years of marriage, producing three now-grown children, Mike and Anna have settled into entrenched domesticity. She is skillful and poised and still beautiful, an instructor of English at the city college. He is a successful graphic artist on the verge of retirement, his awards and ambitions and accomplishments largely behind him. Though the couple’s erotic life has dimmed somewhat, he still considers her ravishing.
But their apparent balance is thrown asunder when Anna breaks the normal silence of their breakfast table with uncontrollable babble about hummingbirds.</description>

      <description>To many readers, who have perhaps known Frankenstein only at second hand, the original may well come as a surprise. When Mary Shelley began it, she was only eighteen, though she was already Shelley&amp;rsquo;s mistress and Byron&amp;rsquo;s friend. In her preface she explains how she and Shelley spent part of a wet summer with Byron in Switzerland, amusing themselves by reading and writing ghost stories. Her contribution was Frankenstein, a story about a student of natural philosophy who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from bones he has collected in charnel-houses.</description>

      <description>For more than four decades, Ursula K. Le Guin has enthralled readers with her imagination, clarity, and moral vision. The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, and five Hugo and five Nebula Awards, this renowned writer has, in each story and novel, created a provocative, ever-evolving universe filled with diverse worlds and rich characters reminiscent of our earthly selves.
Now, in The Birthday of the World, this gifted artist returns to these worlds in eight brilliant short works, including a never-before-published novella, each of which probes the essence of humanity.</description>

Thirty years later he will write: &amp;ldquo;Computer games have taught me the things you can&amp;rsquo;t learn from people.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Amity provides a window to the wreckage caused by wars—the destruction and displacement that leave pain and life-long psychological disorders, here specifically within the contexts of Yugoslavia’s dissolution and Iran’s revolution.
Payvand, an Iranian refugee and activist, still plagued with nightmares, meets a Ragusa, a Yugoslavian refugee whose pockets are loaded with stones as she prepares to walk into the water and end her life, a life that has become intolerable since the loss of those most dear to her.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of books as an escape. That sounds a little too negative but I enjoy experiencing a story that I would probably never experience myself. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve gravitated to historical fiction because it&amp;rsquo;s just so different and unknown territory.</description>

 What is your favorite Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day read? Submitted by Kristin @ Lukten av Trykksverte
 Is it okay for me to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t have any&amp;#8230;? I don&amp;rsquo;t really read anything specifically for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day. I also don&amp;rsquo;t recall any Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day themed books.</description>

      <description>I recently finished reading Mary and The Wrongs of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft. I received this book from a friend of my mothers. I actually received multiple books from my mother&amp;rsquo;s friend, many of them classics such as Villette by Charlotte Bronte, Emma by Jane Austen, Frankenstein by Mary Shelly (who is, by the way, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft), etc. I managed to find many books that I enjoyed from her gift.</description>

      <description>This is very long overdue but I was blog hopping and came across The Daily Prophecy ran by Mel. Her latest post was a quick survey of all the books she read in 2016. At the end of her post, she posed the question:
 What is the best book you read in 2016?
 This is a very tough question for me to answer. I read a couple of very good books this year.</description>

 Is everyday a reading day for you? Submitted by Elizabeth @ Silver&amp;rsquo;s Reviews
 I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make it a habit of reading everyday. Realistically though, I only really read during the work week. Those days I specifically block out times for myself dedicated for reading: on the way to and from work (since I take public transportation).</description>

 Where&amp;rsquo;s your favourite place to read? Submitted by Ronyell @ Rabbit Ears Book Blog
 I will be honest&amp;#8230; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have a favourite place, as long as I&amp;rsquo;m reading. In terms of places where I usually read is on the bus or when I&amp;rsquo;m eating.</description>

      <description>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&amp;rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&amp;rsquo;s network&amp;#8230; Kinda rough.
However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&amp;rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</description>

      <description>This year I told myself I would read at least 25 books. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like a lot but when you consider my reading history the past couple of years, that&amp;rsquo;s a big number.
 2015: 7 books + 3 graphic novels = 10 books 2014: 19 books + 20 graphic novels = 39 books 2013: 40 books + 30 graphic novels = 74 books 2012: 18 books  As you can see, not great numbers.</description>

      <description>I recently made a trip to the library. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I managed to grab.
Buried in Books: A Reader&amp;rsquo;s Anthology by Julie Rugg
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly why they&amp;rsquo;re on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me.</description>

      <description>On Goodreads, my &amp;ldquo;want-to-own&amp;rdquo; shelf used to have 127 books in it. Now it has five.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been bit by the konmari bug. I&amp;rsquo;ve konmari&amp;rsquo;d my wardrobe and my books so far. I&amp;rsquo;m still stuck on the books. I decided it would be fitting to prevent my book collection from growing back to it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous size and get rid of anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t spark joy on my book wish list.</description>

      <description>I recently resolved not to take out any library books unless they were on my to read list. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I took out on my latest trip to the library!
Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember why or how this book got onto my to read list but I know that it&amp;rsquo;s been on the list for quite a while. I was glad to see the book sitting on the shelf since I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m extremely fond of Charlotte Brontë. Villette is easily my favourite novel and I hold it very close to my heart. A couple week ago I finally got around to reading Jane Eyre and it did not disappoint. The other members of the Brontë family are not to be overlooked either. I enjoyed Emily&amp;rsquo;s Wuthering Heights and all of Anne&amp;rsquo;s books are in my to read list. So when I stumbled upon The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë by Syrie James in the library, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist picking it up.</description>

      <description>The Art of Manliness put out this list of books. I am not a man but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how I do with this list. Turns I&amp;rsquo;ve only read 8% of this list. Out of the books I want to read from this list, I&amp;rsquo;ve read 24%. Not any better, but hey. I&amp;rsquo;m really trying to cull the books I want to read though. I will never be able to read everything I want to read.</description>

      <description>I initially started writing this post in 2012. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through and cleaning out my drafts and decided this one was worthy of continuing and actually publishing.
Comics are usually written off as being childish or something only nerds can enjoy. But, I&amp;rsquo;m not here to argue whether comics are legitimate literature or not. I&amp;rsquo;m here to point out some of my favourite web comics. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where it started but I got bored one day and eventually ended up on a web comics site.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to document my life in a journal. There is something awfully romantic about keeping an account of your day to day life. I just read a book, Fairyland by Alysia Abbott, about a woman who grew up with a single gay father in the &amp;lsquo;80s. She reconstructed both her and her father&amp;rsquo;s life through his journals and their letters to each other. I find it so beautiful.</description>

      <description>Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a really &amp;ldquo;bookish&amp;rdquo; mood lately. Mostly because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on getting my book database up and running. I was pretty nostalgic over the idea of &amp;ldquo;book blogs&amp;rdquo; and my unsuccessful attempt at a book blog still haunts me today. I decided: I shall blog about books. Book reviews will belong in my book database but anything else will go here. So what exactly is a book blog post that isn&amp;rsquo;t a review?</description>

      <description>In a way, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to read stories about (romantic) love anymore. Too much emphasis is put on love, whether it be on screen, in print, or just in life in general. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m saying that love isn&amp;rsquo;t important, because it is important. How a character approaches love can speak volumes about their personality. But I just don&amp;rsquo;t want it to be the main plot, or even a sub-plot.</description>

      <description>I’m still waiting to fall in love with a book. I want to open it and never want to put it down ever again. I want to find myself in it. I want it to drag out the dark from inside of me and then I want it to tell me that it’s okay and to list all the things that are good about me. I want to read it and never look at life and humanity the same way again.</description>

      <description>I quit Tumblr for Lent. It&amp;rsquo;s only been a couple of days, and I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated so many Tumblr blog posts in my mind and it&amp;rsquo;s kinda driving me crazy. So crazy to the point where a Tumblr and serious blog crossover is inevitable. Tumblr posts are mostly Twitter-like in nature, except ten times the sarcasm, ten times the ironic usage of poor grammar and spelling, and ten times that length.</description>

Usually most people do these resolution posts on the first day of the year, but I do mine second! No, I was busy with the opening of my new blog, go check it out. On with the post!
1. Post more I hate how this has to be a resolution, but yes, I want to post more.</description>

      <description>Lent is over. I haven&amp;rsquo;t visited Room 304 or Goodreads in over 40 days. Geez, I have a lot of catching up to do. I did read over those 40 days but definitely not a lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve been swamped with school work and going to sleep at midnight every night doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave much time for reading.
So, I&amp;rsquo;ve resorted to audiobooks. Yeah, yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;lazy way of reading&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving some sort of world that I can delve into and just absorb.</description>

I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &amp;ldquo;play all&amp;rdquo; function so that was interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case at all.</description>

      <description>Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&amp;rsquo;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy studying and working on Room 304. I&amp;rsquo;m actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&amp;rsquo;t study at all and now I&amp;rsquo;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.</description>

Last year around this time, I set a goal for myself: read 100 books before 2011 ends. I&amp;rsquo;m an avid manga reader and I can finish one volume of manga in an hour so a week into the challenge I found that I was already a quarter of the way through the challenge (keep in mind this was during winter break, haha).</description>

Calling All Bookworms:
Summer is almost over and I have read about 120 books. Whoot! It may seem impossible but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Very few of the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read stand out in my mind. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bookworm, check out these books!
