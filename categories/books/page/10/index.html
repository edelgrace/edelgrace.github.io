<blockquote>
<p>Do you prefer to blog about (a) specific book genre(s), or do you have an eclectic blog?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read a lot of genres and therefore my blog reflects that. So yes, I have an eclectic blog! When I pick books to read, I don&rsquo;t consciously pick something by the genre. I think I tend to read a lot of memoirs, historical fiction, and romance. Lately I&rsquo;ve been on a fantasy binge. Really, I don&rsquo;t know if there is a genre I would <strong>not</strong> read and then blog about!</p>

          <p><p>My last semester was extremely busy. So busy that I spent my commute on the train sleeping everyday instead of my usual reading. I&rsquo;ll admit, most of my reading is done when I&rsquo;m on the train. So other than the occasional manga or cookbook, I hardly read the last couple months of last year. Which is devastating.</p>

<p>This year (like every year), I resolved to read more. I started out the year reading two non-fictional books about personal finance. Good insightful content but hardly stimulating.</p>

<p>On impulse, I was at the library paying fines (my water bottle exploded in my backpack and ruined a book, I&rsquo;m still a bit peeved) when I saw <em>Emily of New Moon</em> by L. M. Montgomery on the shelf. I had just finished watching <em>Anne</em> on Netflix and I needed another dosage of Montgomery goodness.</p>

<p>Reading through <em>Emily of New Moon</em> struck something within me. Whenever I read good literature, I always have an urge to write. I know that I will never be as good as the authors that inspire me, but most of the time I just want to write for the sake of posterity.</p>

<p>In <em>Emily of New Moon</em>, the main character (you guessed it, Emily) writes letters to her father as a sort of journaling mechanism. This made me long for my journal. I have tried writing journals many times but my anxiety of my mother reading my journal has made me hesitate each time. I see this blog as a sort of journal but I still have to censor myself as this is (obviously) public. I do admire those who can freely write in their blogs but it&rsquo;s hard for me to take that step especially since many of my thoughts are so personal.</p>

<p>Reading about this little girl writing so freely made me envious. I started to write a little more in a notebook.</p>

<p>Then I heard about the passing of Ursula K. Le Guin. It&rsquo;s been around a year since I first stumbled upon <em>A Fisherman of the Inland Sea.</em> I was completely enamored by the book. When I was younger, I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy. Things like <em>Dragon Rider</em> by Cornelia Funke, <em>The Old Kingdom</em> series by Garth Nix, <em>Harry Potter</em> (of course), <em>The Last Dragon Chronicles</em> by Chris d&rsquo;Lacey, etc. There was something about being immersed in a totally fictional and supernatural world that I found captivating.</p>

<p>Le Guin is a master at creating such worlds, although she tends towards science fiction rather than fantasy (in my opinion). Her world building is expansive and natural and oh so imaginative (I picture Anne of Green Gables saying a similar thing with her eyes wide and her hands clasped).</p>

<p>Two of my friends are currently taking a science fiction course where they will eventually read Le Guin&rsquo;s <em>The Left Hand of Darkness.</em> I&rsquo;ve read a couple of Le Guin&rsquo;s books (mostly compilations of her short stories) but haven&rsquo;t touched any of her more popular novels. Thanks to the power of Audible, I managed to get a free copy of the audiobook.</p>

<p>However, listening to Le Guin&rsquo;s words just isn&rsquo;t the same as reading them. Maybe it was the narrator but I couldn&rsquo;t get myself into it. There was one scene that I could pay attention to but when it came to the description of politics and the general world, I couldn&rsquo;t focus.</p>

<p>So I made a trip to my local library to scout for some more of her books. <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> is a popular book and the wait-list for it was thirty people long so I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be reading that any time soon. But I did manage to pick up one of her books that were decidedly not science-fiction, <em>The Unreal and the Real: Volume One: Where on Earth.</em></p>

<p>I had barely read through the introduction and the first sentence of the first chapter when I put the book down. I instinctively shivered and got out my notebook to essentially write most of what I have already written here. It was a special moment. Le Guin had captured me entirely.</p>

<p>In a way, I&rsquo;m jealous at how beautifully Le Guin seems to string along her sentences. I&rsquo;ve never really had a way with words, especially if they come out of my mouth. I have to think slowly and carefully and even in the written form, I&rsquo;m not as eloquent as I wish I could be.</p>

<p>Even though I could never hope to be a master of words like Le Guin and Montgomery, I can imagine. I can spin tales in my head and conjure up these characters that seem real to me. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to capture their essence in the written form but at least they&rsquo;re something that I&rsquo;ve created. I think having an imagination is a wonderful thing. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve imagined anything and I&rsquo;m glad that reading has started my mind up again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion. Her passive rebellion manifests in ever more bizarre and frightening forms, leading her bland husband to self-justified acts of sexual sadism. His cruelties drive her towards attempted suicide and hospitalisation. She unknowingly captivates her sister&rsquo;s husband, a video artist. She becomes the focus of his increasingly erotic and unhinged artworks, while spiralling further and further into her fantasies of abandoning her fleshly prison and becoming &#8211; impossibly, ecstatically &#8211; a tree.</p>

<p>Fraught, disturbing and beautiful, The Vegetarian is a novel about modern day South Korea, but also a novel about shame, desire and our faltering attempts to understand others, from one imprisoned body to another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember one time I participated in a blog hop where one of the prompts mentioned seeking out diverse voices, usually cultural. I was a little shocked that a lot of people said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seek it out or make a point to find authors with a different point of view from mine.&rdquo; I think there is a lot of different voices out there that you need to seek out because their voices need to be heard.</p>

<p>One of my friends started up a book club, #milliesbookclub, that would explore Asian American authors and their works. Being Asian American myself (Asian Canadian to be exact), I was extremely interested. For minorities, it can be easy to have your voice drowned out. In general, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the literature industry regardless but it seemed important to intentionally seek out these Asian American authors. So out of this book club, <em>The Vegetarian</em> was chosen.</p>

<p>My first impression of this novel was that it was extremely Murakami-esque. Haruki Murakami almost always features peculiar women and these women almost always serve as some sort of motivator for the male protagonists. Murakami is frequently accused to using the manic pixie dream girl trope again and again and it was a little bit disappointing to see this again in another Asian author.</p>

<p>The male characters in this book were no different from how Murakami portrays his male characters. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s brother-in-law is obsessed with her to the point of his destroying his marriage and taking advantage of her mental vulnerability. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s husband forces himself upon her and selfishly only thinks of how her antics affect him. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s father was abusive to her for her entire life, even displaying physical aggression towards her in her adult life. It&rsquo;s no wonder that Yeong-hye retreats inward and pursues the notion that becoming a tree would bring the ultimate state of nirvana.</p>

<p>While I did find Yeong-hye&rsquo;s passion a little ridiculous and self destructive, I have finally come to the conclusion (with a little bit of help) that it boiled down to a form of escapism and served as a great foil to Yeong-hye&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>It maybe be obvious that Yeong-hye wasn&rsquo;t so keen on the life that she lived due to all of the not-so-great males she had around her. I still don&rsquo;t see the significance in becoming a tree but I do love how this demonstrates a positive attribute that Yeong-hye possesses which her sister does not.</p>

<p>Despite everything, Yeong-hye is true to herself. Compared to her sister, she is not a subservient and too obedient woman who is too polite to the point of irritation. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s brother-in-law makes this observation as he wonders why his wife would not lash out at him for his absenteeism in the family and instead becomes a little bit too accommodating. This is also shown when Yeong-hye&rsquo;s sister has a strong sense of duty towards her son which keeps her from succumbing to her depression whereas Yeong-hye is eager to let go of what little life she has left regardless of her obligations. Yeong-hye is more willing to break conventions as she only answers to herself.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, most of the other members of the book club didn&rsquo;t like this novel. I can see why. The male characters are disgusting and abhorrent. The fragile and subservient Asian woman stereotype is tiring. It&rsquo;s a frustrating read that reminds you that society is pretty much still patriarchal and misogynistic. It isn&rsquo;t empowering in the slightest, one of the aims the book club was created to begin with. Honestly, it&rsquo;s the last book that I would ever thing Millie would like to read. However, there was something fascinating about this book that never let me put it down until I finished.</p>

<p>I became invested in Yeong-hye and her sister. I could have skipped all the sections about Yeonh-hye&rsquo;s husband and brother-in-law easily. These two women wronged by the most important men in their lives struck a chord with me. The book made me want to know what became of the two sisters and how they could possibly rebuild their lives. I wanted to know what really went on their minds while we saw their husband&rsquo;s points of view and who they really were behind who the men thought they were.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think Han Kang made the right choice using male narrators for a good portion of the book because it really painted an accurate picture of the situation. However, it feels like she barely scratched the surface with the female characters but there was some sort of sense of redemption for the female characters.</p>

<p>If you can look past the social undertones in the book, I think it would be a good read. Most reviews I&rsquo;ve seen focused on the oddity and weirdness of the situation and less on the characters, which is fine but you&rsquo;ll never know how you feel about the book until you read it for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Topics of sexuality, religion, and spoilers for the book is mentioned in this blog post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A revelatory novel about being queer and Muslim, set in war-torn Iraq in 2003. Ramy is a young gay Iraqi struggling to find a balance between his sexuality, religion, and culture. Ammar is a sheikh whose guidance Ramy seeks, and whose tolerance is tested by his belief in the teachings of the Qur&rsquo;an. Full of quiet moments of beauty and raw depictions of violence, God in Pink poignantly captures the anguish and the fortitude of Islamic life in Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a lot of things going on nowadays in Iraq and surrounding countries, I find myself becoming a little more interested in the lives of a typical Muslim. I understand that being queer and Muslim isn&rsquo;t exactly &ldquo;typical&rdquo; but it was a topic I&rsquo;m drawn to being queer and somewhat religious myself. Namir takes a very different take on this scenario than from what I expected. This little novel takes on the perspectives of Ramy, a gay man wanting to find a way through being gay in Muslim society, and Sheikh Ammar is a preacher who does not not to even entertain the idea of homosexuality.</p>

<p>Although in his mid-twenties, Ramy seems to me like a young teenager. He is full of passion, extremely rash, idealistic, but also a little hesitant to fully break free. He falls for men somewhat fast and extremely hard. Although he longs for freedom, he sees around him in the closeted gay community full of hypocrisy and tragedy. His family keeps pushing for marriage not just because it&rsquo;s expected but because on some level, they know Ramy is gay and they want to either help him keep it a secret or to convince themselves that he&rsquo;s actually straight and not gay. While his whirlwind and bloody romances are expected, what&rsquo;s not so expected is the supernatural twist Namir puts to this tale.</p>

<p>Sheikh Ammar begins to have hallucinations of a pink cherub, Angel Gabriel, and a woman donned in a Burqa, Abaddon. They act as opposite sides of his conscious. Angel Gabriel is gay and encourages Ammar to accept Ramy in all of his glorious gayness whereas Abaddon points out the Islamic teachings that say otherwise. This supernatural twist was something that seemed almost left field for me. I did not expect it. I can&rsquo;t say for sure if I like it or not. I feel like I wouldn&rsquo;t be missing out on much if Ammar&rsquo;s storyline was cut out completely. I do like the turn Namir takes with Ammar however. In the end, Ammar turns to cross dressing and pretty much renounces his religion completely.</p>

<p>Overall, it seemed a bit of a rollercoaster going from one storyline to another. The moments when they intersected were disappointing. Both main characters had their moments of ridiculousness for me. What disappointed me the most was how little of Ramy&rsquo;s life after marriage panned out. I&rsquo;m not disappointed that the marriage happened because it is realistic, I could totally see it happening. But Namir got me invested in Jameela and I felt a twinge of sympathy for her marrying a man who could not love her as fully as a man who was interested in women was.</p>

<p>Somehow though, I liked it. It was quirky and a little fun. It wasn&rsquo;t as serious as I thought it would be but I think adding the tinge of dreamy-like aspects made it a more enjoyable read.</p>

Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Name a book that changed your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Busting out the big questions. This is a hard one to answer. I think that I&rsquo;m still trying to find it. I have my favourite books but I&rsquo;m not sure of their impact on my life. They seemed to be entertaining books rather than books that held a lot of weight.</p>

<p>My first inclination was to think of any self help books I&rsquo;ve read but none come to my mind. Then I thought of my favourite book, <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Bronte. I relate a lot to the main character in this book and it made me extremely emotional, however I don&rsquo;t think I changed any more after reading it. I just really related to the character and it somehow reinforced my pessimistic outlook.</p>

<p>So to have an actual answer, I think the one book that changed my life was probably the very first book that I had ever read out of my own volition, even if I don&rsquo;t remember what that book could have been. Reading is such a big part of my life, I think my life would be very different if I had never taken up a book that I actually wanted to read and was not forced to read in school. Can you imagine a life without reading? Neither can I.</p>
