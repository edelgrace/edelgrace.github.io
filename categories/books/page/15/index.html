          <p>

<p>I initially started writing this post in 2012. I&rsquo;ve been going through and cleaning out my drafts and decided this one was worthy of continuing and actually publishing.</p>

<p>Comics are usually written off as being childish or something only nerds can enjoy. But, I&rsquo;m not here to argue whether comics are legitimate literature or not. I&rsquo;m here to point out some of my favourite web comics. I don&rsquo;t know where it started but I got bored one day and eventually ended up on a web comics site. I thought I wasn&rsquo;t one for web comics but eventually, I was hooked.</p>

<h3 id="myth">MYth</h3>

<p><a href="http://myth.smackjeeves.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/myth.jpg" alt="myth" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11048" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/myth.jpg 468w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/myth-300x38.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://myth.smackjeeves.com">MYth</a> by <a href="http://zeldacw">Zelda</a>. I stumbled upon the author&rsquo;s DeviantArt page and eventually ended up on her web comic. I was immediately impressed and in awe.</p>

<p>MYth is a spin off on Greek mythology. It&rsquo;s so good that it received two awards from Tokyopop, one of the major comic book publishers in North America. In MYth, there are multiple story arcs. The arc I last read included Zeus and Hades (typical, right?) in their younger years in a different light than most people would think of. Zelda has such a wonderful interpretation of the two gods and their relationship that it makes the story seem like her own and not taken from myths. It&rsquo;s just an incredible comic.</p>

<h3 id="one-halfed">One Halfed</h3>

<p><a href="http://1halfed.smackjeeves.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/onehalfed.png" alt="one halfed" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11050" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/onehalfed.png 468w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/onehalfed-300x38.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>

<p>On the other side of the spectrum, there&rsquo;s angst-ridden and dramatic slice of life web comic, <a href="http://1halfed.smackjeeves.com">One Halfed</a> by 2die. This comic is absolutely beautiful. The drawings are expressive and just so darn appealing to the eye. Also, you can&rsquo;t ignore the plot. It&rsquo;s mostly character driven so if you&rsquo;re looking for some action packed explosions you&rsquo;re looking in the wrong place. The characterization and the development of the characters are superb which is rare for any kind of literature. Currently, updates are slowly trickling in. The artist was on hiatus for a while but it seems that they are &ldquo;back.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="no-pink-ponies">No Pink Ponies</h3>

<p><a href="http://nopinkponies.keenspot.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nopinkponies.gif" alt="no pink ponies" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11051" /></a></p>

<p>Okay, <a href="http://nopinkponies.keenspot.com">No Pink Ponies</a> hasn&rsquo;t been updated in over a year now. It&rsquo;s incredibly sad but the journey through the comic is worth it. It&rsquo;s sad when an author abandons their work but it&rsquo;s pretty much normal in the web comic world. This comic is very slice of life and a little goofy. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun with the right amount of seriousness. Unfortunately (?) it does play into the whole geeky aspect of comics and such, but I love geek culture so that wasn&rsquo;t an issue for me. I adore the art style. It&rsquo;s very much &ldquo;Western comic&rdquo; to the tee.</p>

<h3 id="crescendo">Crescendo</h3>

<p><a href="http://crescendocomic.smackjeeves.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/crescendo.gif" alt="crescendo" width="468" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11052" /></a></p>

<p>I really love my slice of life! This one is very centered on romance. The characters can be a little bit one dimensional, fitting perfectly into their stereotypes but overall, they&rsquo;re pretty interesting! Usually you hear about the &ldquo;rich girl&rdquo; and the &ldquo;working class guy&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s nice seeing it &ldquo;switch up.&rdquo; I really enjoy <a href="http://crescendocomic.smackjeeves.com">Crescendo</a>! The art is so pretty and since it&rsquo;s an active comic, I love reading the comments whenever an update comes up.</p>

<h3 id="society-of-vice">Society of Vice</h3>

<p><a href="http://sovcomic.smackjeeves.com"><img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sov.jpg" alt="sov" width="350" height="60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11053" srcset="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sov.jpg 350w, http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sov-300x51.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a></p>

<p>The great thing about self-publishing comics is that there is so much variety in the range of topics that can be covered from all sorts of different people without restraint. <a href="http://sovcomic.smackjeeves.com">Society of Vice</a> is about a therapy group which includes a couple of LGBTQ+ members. The water colour art style is GORGEOUS! Seriously! Unfortunately, the comic is currently on hiatus last time I checked. The content is pretty mature so read with caution.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to document my life in a journal. There is something awfully romantic about keeping an account of your day to day life. I just read a book, <a href="http://books.erzadel.net/index.php?p=books.fairyland-a-memoir-of-my-father">Fairyland by Alysia Abbott</a>, about a woman who grew up with a single gay father in the &lsquo;80s. She reconstructed both her and her father&rsquo;s life through his journals and their letters to each other. I find it so beautiful.</p>

<p>Is it because I want to leave behind some sort of proof of my existence? Will I even have anyone to read my writings when I&rsquo;m gone? I don&rsquo;t even want to have kids eventually, at this point of my life. Maybe my life isn&rsquo;t even that interesting to keep up a diary. But I do love reading my old blog posts, no matter how cringe they are.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I&rsquo;d keep physical accounts of my life. I&rsquo;m still bitter over the fact that my mother takes it upon herself to read my journals now. I love the physical act of writing and the tangibility of writing makes is seem so much more precious. But then I found out my mother has been snooping. One day she mentioned a topic that I never told her about, but something that I had wrote. I was so extremely angry but I didn&rsquo;t say anything. It&rsquo;s not like I just leave my journals out in the open. I take lengths to hide them but my mother still manages to find them. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not as clever as I think I am.</p>

<p>I took up writing in <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/elianscript.htm">Elian script</a> to counteract this. However, decoding my entries took way too long. I recently found an easier script to read, <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/liron.php">Liron</a>. But I am so resentful (I looked up synonyms for bitter, haha) that I have to go through these measures.</p>

<p>I want to take up writing frequent blog posts, at the price of making these posts private. But what if my blog gets hacked? There&rsquo;s a little more risk involved than having my mother read my journals. I&rsquo;m really conflicted.</p>

</center></p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve been in a really &ldquo;bookish&rdquo; mood lately. Mostly because I&rsquo;ve been working on getting my <a href="http://books.scattered.me">book database</a> up and running. I was pretty nostalgic over the idea of &ldquo;book blogs&rdquo; and my unsuccessful attempt at <a href="http://books.mazohyst.org">a book blog</a> still haunts me today. I decided: I shall blog about books. Book reviews will belong in my book database but anything else will go here. So what exactly is a book blog post that isn&rsquo;t a review? Memes, of course.</p>

<p>A meme who&rsquo;s concept resonates deeply with me, &ldquo;book boyfriends&rdquo; or as I like to call them: crushes on fictional people (because screw heteronormativity and cissexism).</p>

<p>So, my fictional crush for the week is:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
  <strong>Oshima from Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami</strong>
</p>

<p><center>
  <img src="http://scattered.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kafka.png" alt="kafka" width="189" height="284" class="img-responsive" />
</center></p>

<p>Some fan-art of Oshima that I mostly agree with (links because I don&rsquo;t have the patience to ask for permission from the artists): <a href="http://rittlerion.com/profpics/oshima.png">Lisa Ito</a>, <a href="http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lw59v5xs7X1qjd1kgo1_500.gif">Unknown pixiv artist</a>, <a href="http://s82.photobucket.com/user/kingrei/media/junk/oshima.png.html">Unknown artist</a>.</p>

<p>This week, I only read three books<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-9166">1</a></sup> and to be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t liking my choices! Two out of three books had characters I was indifferent about/loathed (especially the men, oh god, <em>especially</em> the men).</p>

<p>Except, for one. Oshima.</p>

<p>Oshima is a character who works at a small privately owned library. That&rsquo;s a total turn on for sure. How many guys work at libraries?</p>

<p>Anyway, Oshima acts as a mentor for the main character, Kafka. Oshima is instantly helpful towards Kafka, who is a teenage runaway. He provides temporary shelter for Kafka, gives him a job, comforts him when he feels lost. At times, it&rsquo;s like Oshima goes to the ends of the earth for Kafka, a kid whom he had only known for a week. That, is admirable. Most people would call the cops or tell Kafka to scram. Not Oshima. He recognizes Kafka&rsquo;s running away as an act of finding himself and not as a petty rebellious phase.</p>

<p>Paired with his compassion, is his intellect. Of course, being a library assistant at a library, he is incredibly well read and has a thirst for knowledge. Definitely my kind of guy. He quotes from Greek myths and discusses different philosophers and tries to explain things in lengthy monologues. Half of what he says though, does seem like a bunch of non-sense that I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around (that&rsquo;s Murakami&rsquo;s style though). Still, you can&rsquo;t help be impressed.</p>

<p>There is one scene where Oshima slams down a pair of cissexist feminists, which I totally cheered at<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-9166">2</a></sup>. Although I don&rsquo;t really agree with his conception of feminism, at least we can agree that cissexism sucks and he gets extra kudos for that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this goes against him or not but Oshima is such a hipster. Totally a hipster. Who listens to Schubert? Let me rephrase: what 21 year old male who doesn&rsquo;t play an instrument listens to Schubert? Heck, even I don&rsquo;t listen to Schubert<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-9166">3</a></sup>. Plus, he&rsquo;s knowledgeable about Schubert and can analyze his works and oh goodness, it&rsquo;s all so attractive.</p>

<p>Lastly, it seems that Oshima is indeed physically attractive. Upon meeting Oshima for the first time, Kafka thinKs that he is a girl. I know feminine boys aren&rsquo;t for everyone, but I&rsquo;m not picky about looks. He wears glasses, just the way I like them (wow, I feel shallow). He is young, early 20s, 21 if I recall correctly. That amplifies everything I said about him by tenfold.</p>

<p>Now, would I actually get along with him and him with me? Probabaly not. Thank goodness it&rsquo;s just a book crush.</p>

          <p><p>In a way, I don&rsquo;t want to read stories about (romantic) love anymore. Too much emphasis is put on love, whether it be on screen, in print, or just in life in general. Not that I&rsquo;m saying that love isn&rsquo;t important, because it is important. How a character approaches love can speak volumes about their personality. But I just don&rsquo;t want it to be the main plot, or even a sub-plot. I just want love to be there. Just let it happen or note that it has happened already.</p>

<p>Love drives us but it isn&rsquo;t the only thing that drives us. Sometimes it&rsquo;s survival, sometimes it&rsquo;s the desire for status, sometimes it&rsquo;s our family, and sometime&rsquo;s it just not love.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hear different stories. I want to hear stories of personal struggles that do not revolve around not being able to get laid. I&rsquo;m not invalidating those struggles but I am tired of hearing it, of seeing it, and of reading it. I want to hear adventures in faraway lands that may or may not be real. I want to hear tales of fantasy. I want to experience something more than just love.</p>

<p>I guess all it boils down to is that love is overrated and while important, it&rsquo;s still not as important as we think it is.</p>

          <p><p>I’m still waiting to fall in love with a book. I want to open it and never want to put it down ever again. I want to find myself in it. I want it to drag out the dark from inside of me and then I want it to tell me that it’s okay and to list all the things that are good about me. I want to read it and never look at life and humanity the same way again. And not for an hour, not for day, not for a month, not for a year, but for the rest of my life. I want to be able to read it again and again and each time it will be different but each time it will become even more beautiful than before. I want it to become familiar, so familiar that I could just know the amount of times the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; appears on page 86 but every time I quote a line from memory, it will read with a new meaning.</p>

<p>I say I’m waiting to fall in love with a book but I think I’m just waiting to fall in love with a person.</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, I really want a book (an actual book) to grab me. The closest thing I&rsquo;ve come to one is <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Bronte. I love that book. I&rsquo;ve sadly only read it once but I now I feel like I should read it again.</p>

<p>Even now, the mere mention of the name &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo; evokes a pang of pain and sympathy (and no, not because of Lucy Stillman even though I do feel pain at the sound of her name but that&rsquo;s a different kind of pain).</p>

<p>Lucy is an ironic name. &ldquo;Light,&rdquo; The first thing you see in a new morning. Hope. Optimism. No, Lucy has no hope and her life is a pessimist&rsquo;s dream (or rather, nightmare). Her last name says more about her than her first: Snowe. &ldquo;Cold.&rdquo; Lifeless. But at the same time snow is white: pure and innocent.</p>

<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s entirely innocent or pure, there&rsquo;s still something beautifully naive about her. Her isolated nature brings out a sort of awkwardness. She pores herself into her books, makes believe that her unrequited love might just love her back (all the while knowing that he doesn&rsquo;t), indulges in her isolation, doesn&rsquo;t allow herself to feel true anger at the mere child who stole her unrequited love from her, reason destroys her because she feels like she is just a tool to be used by others, reason doesn&rsquo;t allow her to enjoy life because she knows there isn&rsquo;t much to enjoy, and there&rsquo;s just so much about Lucy Snowe that is beautiful.</p>

<p>And then there was that rare event when someone fell in love with her and she fell in love back. Someone who didn&rsquo;t find her as an odd girl but was in love with her Protestant quirks, her quick wit, and her abundant knowledge. They planned to get married but her lover is swept away by the sea.</p>

<p>How tragic. How utterly tragic. Lucy, there is no hope for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Me she had forgotten. I was changed too; though not, I fear, for the better. I made no attempt to recall myself to her memory: why should I?</em></p>

<p><em>I would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once into my hands, turning over the sacred yellow leaves, ascertaining the title, and perusing with my own eyes the figments which, as an unworthy heretic, it was only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears.</em></p>

<p><em>I suppose he regarded my silences as eccentric.</em></p>

<p><em>This hag, this Reason, would not let me loop up, or smile, or hope: she could not rest unless I were altogether crushed, cowed, broken-in, and broken-down. According to her, I was born only to work for a piece of bread, to await the pains of death, and steadily all life to despond. Reason might be right.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;I believe if you had been a boy, Lucy, instead of a girl &#8211; my mother&rsquo;s god-son instead of god-daughter &#8211; we should have been good friends.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;You are good, you are beautiful; but you are not mine.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;I live in solitary.&rsquo;<br />
&#8216;But solitude is sadness.&rsquo;<br />
&#8216;Yes; it is sadness. Life, however, has worse than that.&rsquo;</em></p>
