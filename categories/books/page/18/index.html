</center></p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve been in a really &ldquo;bookish&rdquo; mood lately. Mostly because I&rsquo;ve been working on getting my <a href="http://books.erzadel.net/blog">book database</a> up and running. I was pretty nostalgic over the idea of &ldquo;book blogs&rdquo; and my unsuccessful attempt at <a href="http://books.mazohyst.org">a book blog</a> still haunts me today. I decided: I shall blog about books. Book reviews will belong in my book database but anything else will go here. So what exactly is a book blog post that isn&rsquo;t a review? Memes, of course.</p>

<p>A meme who&rsquo;s concept resonates deeply with me, &ldquo;book boyfriends&rdquo; or as I like to call them: crushes on fictional people (because screw heteronormativity and cissexism).</p>

<p>So, my fictional crush for the week is:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
  <strong>Oshima from Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami</strong>
</p>

<p><center>
  <img src="http://erzadel.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kafka.png" alt="kafka" width="189" height="284" class="img-responsive" />
</center></p>

<p>Some fan-art of Oshima that I mostly agree with (links because I don&rsquo;t have the patience to ask for permission from the artists): <a href="http://rittlerion.com/profpics/oshima.png">Lisa Ito</a>, <a href="http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lw59v5xs7X1qjd1kgo1_500.gif">Unknown pixiv artist</a>, <a href="http://s82.photobucket.com/user/kingrei/media/junk/oshima.png.html">Unknown artist</a>.</p>

<p>This week, I only read three books<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-9166">1</a></sup> and to be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t liking my choices! Two out of three books had characters I was indifferent about/loathed (especially the men, oh god, <em>especially</em> the men).</p>

<p>Except, for one. Oshima.</p>

<p>Oshima is a character who works at a small privately owned library. That&rsquo;s a total turn on for sure. How many guys work at libraries?</p>

<p>Anyway, Oshima acts as a mentor for the main character, Kafka. Oshima is instantly helpful towards Kafka, who is a teenage runaway. He provides temporary shelter for Kafka, gives him a job, comforts him when he feels lost. At times, it&rsquo;s like Oshima goes to the ends of the earth for Kafka, a kid whom he had only known for a week. That, is admirable. Most people would call the cops or tell Kafka to scram. Not Oshima. He recognizes Kafka&rsquo;s running away as an act of finding himself and not as a petty rebellious phase.</p>

<p>Paired with his compassion, is his intellect. Of course, being a library assistant at a library, he is incredibly well read and has a thirst for knowledge. Definitely my kind of guy. He quotes from Greek myths and discusses different philosophers and tries to explain things in lengthy monologues. Half of what he says though, does seem like a bunch of non-sense that I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around (that&rsquo;s Murakami&rsquo;s style though). Still, you can&rsquo;t help be impressed.</p>

<p>There is one scene where Oshima slams down a pair of cissexist feminists, which I totally cheered at<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-9166">2</a></sup>. Although I don&rsquo;t really agree with his conception of feminism, at least we can agree that cissexism sucks and he gets extra kudos for that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this goes against him or not but Oshima is such a hipster. Totally a hipster. Who listens to Schubert? Let me rephrase: what 21 year old male who doesn&rsquo;t play an instrument listens to Schubert? Heck, even I don&rsquo;t listen to Schubert<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-9166" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-9166">3</a></sup>. Plus, he&rsquo;s knowledgeable about Schubert and can analyze his works and oh goodness, it&rsquo;s all so attractive.</p>

<p>Lastly, it seems that Oshima is indeed physically attractive. Upon meeting Oshima for the first time, Kafka thinKs that he is a girl. I know feminine boys aren&rsquo;t for everyone, but I&rsquo;m not picky about looks. He wears glasses, just the way I like them (wow, I feel shallow). He is young, early 20s, 21 if I recall correctly. That amplifies everything I said about him by tenfold.</p>

<p>Now, would I actually get along with him and him with me? Probabaly not. Thank goodness it&rsquo;s just a book crush.</p>

          <p><p>In a way, I don&rsquo;t want to read stories about (romantic) love anymore. Too much emphasis is put on love, whether it be on screen, in print, or just in life in general. Not that I&rsquo;m saying that love isn&rsquo;t important, because it is important. How a character approaches love can speak volumes about their personality. But I just don&rsquo;t want it to be the main plot, or even a sub-plot. I just want love to be there. Just let it happen or note that it has happened already.</p>

<p>Love drives us but it isn&rsquo;t the only thing that drives us. Sometimes it&rsquo;s survival, sometimes it&rsquo;s the desire for status, sometimes it&rsquo;s our family, and sometime&rsquo;s it just not love.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hear different stories. I want to hear stories of personal struggles that do not revolve around not being able to get laid. I&rsquo;m not invalidating those struggles but I am tired of hearing it, of seeing it, and of reading it. I want to hear adventures in faraway lands that may or may not be real. I want to hear tales of fantasy. I want to experience something more than just love.</p>

<p>I guess all it boils down to is that love is overrated and while important, it&rsquo;s still not as important as we think it is.</p>

          <p><p>I’m still waiting to fall in love with a book. I want to open it and never want to put it down ever again. I want to find myself in it. I want it to drag out the dark from inside of me and then I want it to tell me that it’s okay and to list all the things that are good about me. I want to read it and never look at life and humanity the same way again. And not for an hour, not for day, not for a month, not for a year, but for the rest of my life. I want to be able to read it again and again and each time it will be different but each time it will become even more beautiful than before. I want it to become familiar, so familiar that I could just know the amount of times the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; appears on page 86 but every time I quote a line from memory, it will read with a new meaning.</p>

<p>I say I’m waiting to fall in love with a book but I think I’m just waiting to fall in love with a person.</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, I really want a book (an actual book) to grab me. The closest thing I&rsquo;ve come to one is <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Bronte. I love that book. I&rsquo;ve sadly only read it once but I now I feel like I should read it again.</p>

<p>Even now, the mere mention of the name &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo; evokes a pang of pain and sympathy (and no, not because of Lucy Stillman even though I do feel pain at the sound of her name but that&rsquo;s a different kind of pain).</p>

<p>Lucy is an ironic name. &ldquo;Light,&rdquo; The first thing you see in a new morning. Hope. Optimism. No, Lucy has no hope and her life is a pessimist&rsquo;s dream (or rather, nightmare). Her last name says more about her than her first: Snowe. &ldquo;Cold.&rdquo; Lifeless. But at the same time snow is white: pure and innocent.</p>

<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s entirely innocent or pure, there&rsquo;s still something beautifully naive about her. Her isolated nature brings out a sort of awkwardness. She pores herself into her books, makes believe that her unrequited love might just love her back (all the while knowing that he doesn&rsquo;t), indulges in her isolation, doesn&rsquo;t allow herself to feel true anger at the mere child who stole her unrequited love from her, reason destroys her because she feels like she is just a tool to be used by others, reason doesn&rsquo;t allow her to enjoy life because she knows there isn&rsquo;t much to enjoy, and there&rsquo;s just so much about Lucy Snowe that is beautiful.</p>

<p>And then there was that rare event when someone fell in love with her and she fell in love back. Someone who didn&rsquo;t find her as an odd girl but was in love with her Protestant quirks, her quick wit, and her abundant knowledge. They planned to get married but her lover is swept away by the sea.</p>

<p>How tragic. How utterly tragic. Lucy, there is no hope for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Me she had forgotten. I was changed too; though not, I fear, for the better. I made no attempt to recall myself to her memory: why should I?</em></p>

<p><em>I would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once into my hands, turning over the sacred yellow leaves, ascertaining the title, and perusing with my own eyes the figments which, as an unworthy heretic, it was only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears.</em></p>

<p><em>I suppose he regarded my silences as eccentric.</em></p>

<p><em>This hag, this Reason, would not let me loop up, or smile, or hope: she could not rest unless I were altogether crushed, cowed, broken-in, and broken-down. According to her, I was born only to work for a piece of bread, to await the pains of death, and steadily all life to despond. Reason might be right.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;I believe if you had been a boy, Lucy, instead of a girl &#8211; my mother&rsquo;s god-son instead of god-daughter &#8211; we should have been good friends.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;You are good, you are beautiful; but you are not mine.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;I live in solitary.&rsquo;<br />
&#8216;But solitude is sadness.&rsquo;<br />
&#8216;Yes; it is sadness. Life, however, has worse than that.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p>I quit Tumblr for Lent. It&rsquo;s only been a couple of days, and I&rsquo;ve accumulated so many Tumblr blog posts in my mind and it&rsquo;s kinda driving me crazy. So crazy to the point where a Tumblr and serious blog crossover is inevitable. Tumblr posts are mostly Twitter-like in nature, except ten times the sarcasm, ten times the ironic usage of poor grammar and spelling, and ten times that length. Not to mention the heavily fangirling where everyone assumes that everyone else knows what they&rsquo;re talking about, even if they&rsquo;re not in the fandom (I tried so hard to make this sentence make sense but this is all I got).</p>

<h4 id="ugh-no-wow-stop">Ugh no wow stop</h4>

<p>Attractive engineering guy is really attractive. I haven&rsquo;t seen him since like semester. Now I go to a different lecture for my statics course because my statics prof confuses me. I found out that attractive engineering guy was in the lecture and we&rsquo;ve been sitting together lately. It&rsquo;s nice. I love watching his mouth when he talks. One side of his mouth goes crooked. Really cute. Although he tends to mumble/speak really softly. Combined with the accent I&rsquo;m constantly saying &ldquo;Pardon? Oh goodness, sorry, I didn&rsquo;t hear that&hellip; What? Say that again? &hellip; Pardon?&rdquo; I also noticed that his hair seems to look lighter. I thought it was jet black (or really close to black) but now it looks like a warm and dark chestnut. I also feel stupid now, he got a B+ in the subject I did the worst in and said he wasn&rsquo;t smart. Brb crying in a corner now.</p>

  </div>

<h4 id="jake-why">JAKE WHY</h4>

<p>Today the family and I were eating a nice, quiet dinner and then Homestuck got updated. I know this because my dad suddenly said, &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; It was the sound of my laptop blasting Cascade, the song my update checking software plays every time there&rsquo;s a new Homestuck update. I wanted to go turn it off but my mom was all, &ldquo;No! Stay at the dinner table, no one&rsquo;s supposed to leave until we&rsquo;re all done eating!&rdquo; So we spent the rest of the dinner awkwardly talking over Cascade while I was drowning in tons of Cascade related feels.</p>

<h4 id="holy-crap-that-upd8">HOLY CRAP, THAT UPD8</h4>

<p>KARKAT IS BACK. HOLY ADKHFJKLASDHFKLAJSHF. YES. BBY I MISS YOU. I MISS ALL THE TROLLS. VRISKA WHERE ARE YOUUUU.</p>

<p>WAIT IS HE TALKING INTO A LOBSTER.</p>

<p>(Note: This is a typical Tumblr post for me. Yeah. Tumblr culture is significantly different than the sophisticated blogosphere).</p>

<h4 id="i-m-srsly-so-stupid">I&rsquo;m srsly so stupid</h4>

<p>My chem lab partner is kinda cute, hahahahahaha</p>

<p>*flied out the window*</p>

<p>But I seriously ruined our lab experiment and I just. WHY??</p>

<h4 id="i-take-reading-week-seriously">I take reading week seriously</h4>

<p>I went to the library today and got some awesome possum books. I was delighted to see that my local library had the &ldquo;blind date with a book&rdquo; booth set up. So I picked one up. It was labelled as &ldquo;a wonderfully woven tapestry&rdquo; or something like that. At first I was like, OH GOD A BOOK ABOUT TAPESTRIES HOW HARD CORE IS THAT THIS BOOK SPEAKS TO ME. But it&rsquo;s actually a book about India. That&rsquo;s cool too, but I was disappointed. One day I&rsquo;m going to write a book about five little old ladies in a tapestry weaving club. Now <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> hard core. (I&rsquo;m not even joking I&rsquo;ve got the whole thing planned out).</p>

<h4 id="always-there">Always there</h4>

<p>To the man and his son who I never fail to see every Saturday sitting in front of the religious books whenever I go to Fish Creek,</p>

<p>I assume the worst. The public library is public after all. The first two times I saw you two sitting there, I thought nothing of it. But both times neither of you were looking at the books. This time you were just holding your son, both of you in your own world. I don&rsquo;t know your story. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re always here. But I hope that whatever happens in your life, it will only be good things.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-you-from">Where are you from?</h4>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> Where are you from?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Canada</p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> No like, where are you from?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Canada???</p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> NO. WHERE. ARE. YOU. FROM?</p>

<p>I got this question asked to me yesterday. Twice. I decided to not be sassy and just said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Filipino. I was born here.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s funny whenever people ask me that question. Kinda like how they assume everyone&rsquo;s an immigrant (which is technically true if you go far back enough and if you&rsquo;re not First Nations).</p>

<h4 id="those-midterms-gfdi">Those midterms gfdi</h4>

<p>I had two midterms today. Pretty sure I failed both of them. I&rsquo;m 100% sure I&rsquo;ll do better on the remaining midterms though because I actually know what&rsquo;s going on in those courses.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird how that after I write I write a hard test, I am filled with self loathing. Not just the &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;m so stupid why do I procrastinate I hate myself&rdquo; self loathing you&rsquo;d expect after an academic failure but the &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;m a horrible person like that one time I said a bad thing about that one person x years ago&rdquo; kind of self loathing. I don&rsquo;t understand how that works.</p>

<h4 id="can-t-wait-for-summer">Can&rsquo;t wait for summer!</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s official. We&rsquo;re going to the Philippines for the month of May! My mom just picked up the plane tickets a couple of days ago. I&rsquo;m super excited. I can&rsquo;t wait. I just need to get through this gosh darn awful semester first. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll happen&hellip;</p>

<p>A new year, a new set of resolutions, probably another year where said resolutions are never fulfilled. But it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to at least dream, yeah? Usually most people do these resolution posts on the first day of the year, but I do mine second! No, I was busy with the opening of <a href="http://thelibrariancode.com">my new blog</a>, go check it out. On with the post!</p>

<h2 id="1-post-more">1. Post more</h2>

<p>I hate how this has to be a resolution, but yes, I want to post more. Mostly for my sanity and to make sure that the money I spend on domains are actually worth it (broke university student is broke, I need a job). Plus, I want to look back on my blogs and read my posts and reminisce because I like reminiscing.</p>

<h2 id="2-catch-up-on-my-book-log-at-least-a-little">2. Catch up on my book log, at least a little</h2>

<p>In my <a href="/getting-through-it/">last blog post</a>, one of my goals for the Christmas break was to catch on my book log, <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">Room 304</a>. My total goal for this year is to add 200 hundred more books to the database.</p>

<h2 id="3-spend-only-an-hour-per-week-on-tumblr">3. Spend only an hour per week on Tumblr</h2>

<p>Last week I spent 3 hours on Tumblr, which is AMAZING compared to my all time record of 12 hours of Tumblr during a <strong>school</strong> week. I&rsquo;m a bit ashamed of that statistic. I&rsquo;ve been trying to post less and browse less so hopefully that 3 hours will dwindle down to less than an hour soon! So far, it&rsquo;s Wednesday and I&rsquo;ve already spent 1 hour on Tumblr, but some of this week wasn&rsquo;t 2013 so I&rsquo;ll let that slide. But no more Tumblr for the rest of the week!</p>

<h2 id="4-don-t-gain-weight-lose-more-than-5-pounds">4. Don&rsquo;t gain weight/lose more than 5 pounds</h2>

<p>Most of my days are spent sitting around &ldquo;doing&rdquo; school work or trying to get ahead in programming languages. As you can guess, the pounds have been adding up. I&rsquo;m short so even gaining a pound shows (unfortunately). I want to stay the weight I am now, but if I start unintentionally losing weight (haha that&rsquo;s funny), I don&rsquo;t want to lose too much weight. Five pounds sounds like a good number.</p>

<h2 id="5-don-t-skip-any-lectures">5. Don&rsquo;t skip any lectures</h2>

<p>Last semester I spent a lot of time &ldquo;rearranging&rdquo; lecture time to work on labs or projects (ENGG 200/design was a pain in the butt) or studying for mid-terms. I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that but the temptation is too great. Especially when you find yourself sitting in a lecture that should have 200+ students but only 3 rows of seats are filled and the professor isn&rsquo;t making any sense.</p>

<h2 id="6-stop-doing-assignments-the-day-before">6. Stop doing assignments the day before</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m so guilty of doing this. Last semester a lot of my assignments were due either on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. As a result, a lot of procrastination was done. I need to get out of this habit and quick.</p>

<h2 id="8-be-productive-during-reading-week">8. Be productive during reading week</h2>

<p>Reading week is a &ldquo;week&rdquo;/period preceding examinations according to Wikipedia. Last semester, reading week came along and I was so pumped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do so much studying and do all of my homework!&rdquo; Did it happen? Nope.</p>

<h2 id="9-actually-finish-some-reading-challenges">9. Actually finish some reading challenges</h2>

<p>Click <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/2012-reading-challenges">here</a> and look at my pitiful attempt at all of those reading challenges. I want to read a lot of books in 2012 but nope, that didn&rsquo;t happen. I&rsquo;m only doing 2 challenges this year, the A-Z challenge and to read 100 books (manga and novels).</p>

<h2 id="10-make-something-for-github">10. Make something for GitHub</h2>

<p>I made a GitHub account but it&rsquo;s very empty and lonely. I need something to work on as a side project. I just want something <strong>there</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="11-keep-in-touch-with-my-spiritual-side">11. Keep in touch with my spiritual side</h2>

<p>In light of all of the crazy things going around me, I want to always keep in mind of the bigger (spiritual) picture. It&rsquo;s so easy to lose focus. Admittedly, I haven&rsquo;t been the most &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; person ever but I hope that will change.</p>

<h2 id="12-3-0-gpa-for-this-semester">12. 3.0 GPA for this semester</h2>

<p>If other people can do it, so can I! I&rsquo;m aiming for the 3.0. It will come. IT WILL. No longer shall I be dangerously tip toeing the line between passing and failing!</p>

<h2 id="13-get-a-summer-job">13. Get a summer job</h2>

<p>This is the most important one. I have no volunteer (unless altar serving counts) or work experience. How awful would that look if it stayed that way until I graduated? I need a summer job. Thank goodness summer is so long (four months, thank you so much). Hopefully I can actually find a job with my lack of experience&hellip;</p>
