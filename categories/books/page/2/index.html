<blockquote>
<p>Do you like to finish one book before starting the next or do you read several at once?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m notorious for reading several books at once but eventually it turns into reading one book at a time. I have a ton of books I&rsquo;ve started only to drop for another book instead. I wish I was a faster reader or had more time to read more books then I wouldn&rsquo;t feel the need to start so many books at the same time!</p>

<p>For example, there was a time where I would be listening to an audiobook while I was studying and then I would be reading a physical book during bus rides and then I would have an e-book that I would read while on the computer. Too many things going on at once!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What author do you not read and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right off the top of my head, I don&rsquo;t read Jodi Picoult <em>anymore</em>. I used to really like Jodi Picoult after reading <em>My Sister&rsquo;s Keeper</em> and I went on a binge just reading work after work. That was a mistake because I got tired of her writing very quickly. I stopped seeking her out and I don&rsquo;t think I would read another Jodi Picoult novel again unless someone recommends it to me. There&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with her writing (I enjoyed a lot of her novels) but they all seemed to be the same and I just had enough.</p>

<p>Other than Jodi Picoult, I can&rsquo;t really think of any other authors I don&rsquo;t read. I don&rsquo;t really discriminate by author. There are a lot of genres I don&rsquo;t like and therefore authors who write in those genres I don&rsquo;t read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While attending a traditional tea ceremony in the aftermath of his parents’ deaths, Kikuji encounters his father’s former mistress, Mrs. Ota. At first Kikuji is appalled by her indelicate nature, but it is not long before he succumbs to passion—a passion with tragic and unforeseen consequences, not just for the two lovers, but also for Mrs. Ota’s daughter, to whom Kikuji’s attachments soon extend. Death, jealousy, and attraction convene around the delicate art of the tea ceremony, where every gesture is imbued with profound meaning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The past will always follow you. The main character, Kikuji, learns this first hand in <em>Thousand Cranes</em>. After the death of his father, he is pursued by women from his father&rsquo;s past. There is Chikako, a mistress that his father did not see for long and who constantly meddles in Kikuji&rsquo;s personal affairs. Then there is his father&rsquo;s main mistress, Mrs. Ota, and her daughter, Fumiko. These three women are haunted by Kikuji&rsquo;s father and turn to Kikuji to express their guilt, shame, and envy.</p>

<p>What really captured me about this book was just how irritating these characters were. Chikako was just downright annoying with her constant pestering. Mrs. Ota seemed utterly useless, just crying and (the way I interpreted it) longing for Kikuji&rsquo;s dead father. I had some hope in Fumiko, who seemed like the most normal out of the three women despite her insistence on absorbing the shame of her mother&rsquo;s affair with Kikuji&rsquo;s father. Then there is Kikuji who does nothing and whose only purpose is to serve as a vessel to experience the stories of these three women. I have never disliked so many characters in one book. I also have never wished for redemption for the characters so intensely.</p>

<p>The real kicker about this little novel, however, is how it is written. Kawabata&rsquo;s prose is hauntingly beautiful. I could feel his words to the core. When Fumiko threw down the Shino, I could sense the desperation and the sorrow. I could picture this woman and the expression on her face, and how her arms would carry the burden of the Shino and fling it to the ground, heavy. It was such a delight to read.</p>

<p>I will say that I feel like I should be over the trope of the frail, overly emotional Japanese women who changes a man&rsquo;s perspective on life only to, in the end, commit suicide. I don&rsquo;t know why this is so prominent in the Japanese novels that I have read. It must be cultural and I can firmly say that I don&rsquo;t get it at all. It does make for good stories, even if it makes it a little infuriating.</p>

<p><em>Thousand Cranes</em> was a quick read and I devoured it. Admittedly, I picked this book up because I thought it was <em>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</em>. When I read the summary at the back of the book, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t that book at all but I decided to take it out anyway. I made a good choice, I think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever visited the location of a book you have read?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m Canadian and I rarely go out of my city. I have been the Philippines before and once spent a week in New York City. Not many books take place in the Philippines. I&rsquo;m sure I must have read books with New York City as a setting but I can&rsquo;t think of any off the top of my head. If there was a specific location in New York City, I don&rsquo;t think I would have been since I only visited a few landmarks.</p>

<p>I know that I would love to visit Prince Edward Island one day, from <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>. Avonlea is a fictional place, however, L.M. Montgomery wrote and took inspiration from the town Cavendish. Understandably, Cavendish has some touristy spots relating to <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> and I would definitely take a visit.</p>

<p>There are a couple of places that I would like to go to but they are more for general tourist reasons and not really for a bookish reason. Some of those places are Italy, Japan, Russia, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red Schuhart is a stalker, one of those young rebels who are compelled, in spite of extreme danger, to venture illegally into the Zone to collect the mysterious artifacts that the alien visitors left scattered around. His life is dominated by the place and the thriving black market in the alien products. But when he and his friend Kirill go into the Zone together to pick up a &ldquo;full empty,&rdquo; something goes wrong. And the news he gets from his girlfriend upon his return makes it inevitable that he&rsquo;ll keep going back to the Zone, again and again, until he finds the answer to all his problems.</p>

<p>First published in 1972, Roadside Picnic is still widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction novels, despite the fact that it has been out of print in the United States for almost thirty years. This authoritative new translation corrects many errors and omissions and has been supplemented with a foreword by Ursula K. Le Guin and a new afterword by Boris Strugatsky explaining the strange history of the novel&rsquo;s publication in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading more science fiction. I don&rsquo;t know how accurate that statement is because, really, I&rsquo;ve just been reading a lot of Ursula K. Le Guin and John Wyndham. Both authors approach science fiction in a way that appeals to me. They focus less on the flashy technology and the science but more on the daily and surprisingly human interactions between foreign entities, whether it be the subtleties between races on a planet or humans on a journey to a planet over the span of generations. Discovering new cultures or experiencing what-if scenarios of how humans would react to certain events is what I really appreciate in science fiction.</p>

<p>For some reason, I was a little dubious about <em>Roadside Picnic</em>. A friend of mine recommended this to me and it seemed like we were on the same page when it came to science fiction. I was a little skeptical when I learned that one of their favourite games, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> was based on this book. I&rsquo;m not someone really interested in shooters or high-risk treasure hunts. I gave it a shot anyway since the Strugatsky brothers are quite prolific and the premise seemed interesting. When I got my copy of the book and saw that Le Guin had written the foreword to <em>Roadside Picnic</em>, I was delighted. If my friend with good taste and my number one favourite science fiction author approved of it, it must be good, right?</p>

<p>As predicted, I was not disappointed!</p>

<p>First, let me gush about Le Guin&rsquo;s foreword for a second. Le Guin mentions the context that this novel was written in. Censorship was rampant during this time in the Soviet Union. In the afterword, Boris Strugatsky recounts many of the violations <em>Roadside Picnic</em> managed to accumulate, ranging from acts of violence to crude language to immoral behaviour. Le Guin so succinctly observes that science fiction (in Russia) is a way to write without ideology (in this case, Party ideology). More concisely, &ldquo;They wrote as free men write.&rdquo; That really hyped me for this book.</p>

<p>The universe of <em>Roadside Picnic</em> is soaked with subtle details of the daily lives of stalkers and the collateral damage they leave behind. The concept of the novel is somewhat simple: aliens visited Earth and humans go into those locations to grab whatever the aliens left behind for research, profit, or both. The tales that spin off from this premise are very compelling.</p>

<p>For example, one of the details I really appreciated was watching how Harmont, a regular small town near one of the alien visitation zones, changed and transformed over the years. Initially, the town attracted young people seeking adventure and get rich quick schemes. However, once the allure was ruined by the danger and the infeasibility of such dreams, the young people left or turned to less exciting ventures such as bussing.</p>

<p>While <em>Roadside Picnic</em> explores narratives from several characters, the character in the spotlight the most is Rederick Schuhart or as he is more known by, Red. By far, he is the most interesting character out of all them. When the point of view shifted to other characters, I was a bit bored (bar the one philosophical conversation that I found extremely intriguing). However, the Strugatsky brothers accomplished something in that although I was bored, the content was still important in contributing to the story.</p>

<p>Going back to the philosophical conversation, I love the analogy of the aliens taking a roadside picnic on Earth. The came as quickly as they left, leaving behind garbage that altered the lives of humans and generations after. Sounds familiar? It&rsquo;s just like when we go out in a hike and unintentionally disturb nature with our footprints, our waste, and our alien presence.</p>

<p>This book, overall, was a lot of fun. It is a quick read and although it took me a week to get through it, I found myself flipping pages frantically. I did not want to put it down (it doesn&rsquo;t help that when I read, I usually read on the commute and I can&rsquo;t stay on a train forever).</p>

<p>Another interesting thing that I really liked about this novel was just how Russian it is. When I think dystopian, I think of <em>We</em> by Yevgeny Zamyatin, who is coincidentally also Russian. I remember reading a review of <em>Roadside Picnic</em> that compares the two. They are entirely different but they both are extremely Russian. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but Russian authors have such a distinct voice that I am completely enamoured with. From Nabokov to Bulgakov to Dostoyevsky&hellip; I think I can now add the Strugatsky brothers to my list of Russian authors that I admire.</p>
