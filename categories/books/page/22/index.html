          <p><p>Lent is over. I haven&rsquo;t visited Room 304 or Goodreads in over 40 days. Geez, I have a lot of catching up to do. I did read over those 40 days but definitely not a lot. I&rsquo;ve been swamped with school work and going to sleep at midnight every night doesn&rsquo;t leave much time for reading.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve resorted to audiobooks. Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;lazy way of reading&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve been craving some sort of world that I can delve into and just absorb. Lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to audiobooks while doing homework or when I have a free period in class. Somehow I can manage listening perfectly to an audiobook and manage to do calculus questions (and get them right) at the same time.</p>

<p>So far my favourite audiobook is <em>Seriously&hellip; I&rsquo;m Kidding</em> written and narrated by Ellen Degeneres. Usually I&rsquo;m quite weary about celebrities writing books but whew, this one was just so entertaining! Yeah, it&rsquo;s full of laughs but what else do you expect from a comedian? Ellen is just a ball of excitement and fun. Plus, hearing her narrate her own words really made it lively. However, I do want to read the printed version some time soon.</p>

<p>But yeah, I have quite a lot of catching up to do. I wasted my whole Easter Break trying to do homework and I&rsquo;m kicking my butt over it. I said I would do my homework in two days so I can have free time for the rest of the week but that didn&rsquo;t happen. So now I have 130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, couple of questions of calculus, a chapter&rsquo;s worth work of physics, and a workbook in social to do.</p>

<p>After I do all that, hopefully I can update my reading list. Here&rsquo;s what I have so far:</p>

          <p><p>Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was&hellip; Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &ldquo;play all&rdquo; function so that was interesting. It&rsquo;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. I actually started writing blog posts that I intended to post for later.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s new with my life? Absolutely nothing. I&rsquo;m really getting my butt kicked in everything schoool related. Not literally. But that&rsquo;s not new, I&rsquo;m always getting my butt kicked! I just need to pick up the pace and spring break seems like the greatest oppurtunity to catch up and get on my study horse again.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my little to-do list for the break:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Study for a calculus test.</p></li>

<li><p>Trig review questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Physics homework from last week.</p></li>

<li><p>Activity guide on democracy.</p></li>

<li><p>130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start and finish reading <em>Heart of Darkness</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start reading <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah. I think there&rsquo;s more actually but the most daunting task is those questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I&rsquo;m currently avoiding it but sooner or later I have to do it. I guess looking at that list is motivation in itself. Also, I want to get this done and over with so I have the rest of the break to do whatever I want (sitting at the computer, watching TV, playing video games, and more, haha) instead of doing everything I want first and then staying up until 3 in the morning the day before I go back to school.</p>

<p>On another note, today is my mother&rsquo;s birthday today! She&rsquo;s 53 today. It&rsquo;s interesting how we (we as in teenagers, which I know doesn&rsquo;t apply to all of you out there) get so caught up in our own lives and our growing up but we don&rsquo;t really notice our parent(s)/guardian(s) growing older. Suddenly I notice the wrinkles, the knobby hands, the slightly bent back, and the strands of grey hair. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m starting to appreciate my mom a whole lot more. Happy birthday mom!</p>

          <p><p>Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&rsquo;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong. I&rsquo;m hoping for the best. But I&rsquo;m still worried! My stomach hurts just thinking about it! Thankfully I don&rsquo;t have to go to school until Tuesday. Even then, it seems like not a long time.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I wrote my chemistry, I went to the library and stayed there for a good hour. I took out eight books. <em>Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)</em> by Lee Young-You, <em>Cirque Du Freak (Volume 7)</em> by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai, <em>Perfect Match</em> by Jodi Picoult, <em>Poster Boy</em> by Dede Crane, <em>The Truth About Delilah Blue</em> by Tish Cohen, and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami. You can read more about why I got those books <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/at-the-library-1/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Later on in the evening, I went to a youth group meeting at my parish. It was my first time there (and the first youth group meeting in a year) but I knew everyone there so I didn&rsquo;t really have to worry about social interactions and such. There was a lot of discussion going on, which was quite enjoyable I think. I&rsquo;m not much of a talker so I just listened. I left with a lot to think about, actually. The theme of that meeting was basically being aware of what&rsquo;s happening in the world. Of course, being young adults, we got off topic quite a couple of times but each topic was just as meaningful as the first. I&rsquo;m hoping to go regularly if time permits.</p>

<p>So, a couple days ago I finally transferred my domains from Go Daddy to Namecheap. Why? Because of the constant complaints I always hear about them, the poor customer service, and of course, SOPA. Yes, I do know that Go Daddy no longer supports SOPA and that SOPA is less likely to exist but the fact that they said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t support SOPA anymore&rdquo; right after Wikipedia and thousands more said they were going to move all of their domains from Go Daddy doesn&rsquo;t make them trustworthy in my eyes. It&rsquo;s quite apparent that they only made that statement because of all of the money and potential customers they lost. Good bye Go Daddy and good riddance!</p>

          <p><p>Most people&rsquo;s first post of the year is on the first, but no, I&rsquo;m unique and I&rsquo;ll have mine six days later. I&rsquo;ve been busy studying and working on <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">Room 304</a>. I&rsquo;m actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&rsquo;t study at all and now I&rsquo;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had quite a fun day. Firstly, went to Wal-Mart and bought <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> for our shiny new PS3 that we got over Christmas. Actually, I made the choice to buy it and not my brother. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to play that game ever since I had the demo on my iPod. Needless to say, when I got home I was glued to the TV screen and the controller for the rest of the day.</p>

<div align="center">

</div>

<p>After that, we went to the library. I love the library. I could spend all day in there if the family weren&rsquo;t rushing every single time we go. I got four books and a CD.</p>

<div align="center">
  <a href="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/01482cc4.jpg"><img src="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg94/orangegreendaysuite/01482cc4.jpg" alt="books" width="50%" /></a>
</div>

<p>I nearly flipped out when I looked at the CD. <em>DIR EN GREY &#8211; DUM SPIRO SPERO</em>. Okay, if you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m a <strong>huge</strong> DIR EN GREY fan. They&rsquo;re a Japanese band so buying their music is really expensive (shipping costs, the horror) so I rarely buy anything of theirs. I&rsquo;ve been waiting to listen to this album for the longest time and I refused to download it anywhere. Now I can listen to it without feeling that guilty, because it&rsquo;s from the library. I&rsquo;m still going to buy it eventually though.</p>

<p>The thing about the library is that it&rsquo;s right next to the mall. Where did we go next? The mall. I don&rsquo;t like shopping for clothes but I need clothes so I had to buy clothes. That part was boring.</p>

<p>Like I said before, we got home and I spent the rest of the day playing <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em>. It&rsquo;s such a good game&hellip; I want the other Assassin&rsquo;s Creed games. Expect they&rsquo;re so expensive! Another time I guess.</p>

          <p><p>Whoot~ I got 94% on my chem test! However, I wrote a physics test today and I just know that didn&rsquo;t go very well. I have a math test tomorrow so as soon as I finish writing this post, I&rsquo;m going to go study.</p>

<p>Last year around this time, I set a goal for myself: read 100 books before 2011 ends. I&rsquo;m an avid manga reader and I can finish one volume of manga in an hour so a week into the challenge I found that I was already a quarter of the way through the challenge (keep in mind this was during winter break, haha). So I increased my goal to 500 books. That went along nicely&hellip; Until summer came. During the summer, I read very little. Maybe 5 physical books at the most. It&rsquo;s now December and I&rsquo;ve only read 348 books out of the 500 books. I really want to accomplish my goal but that&rsquo;s impossible if I want to actually study over the winter holidays because well, my future depends on it. I&rsquo;m thinking to change my goal to 400+ books but it feels like I would be cheating the challenge. I am very tempted to do it&hellip;</p>

<p>I took part in many other book challenges this year as well. Such as a colour coded challenge (reading a book with every colour of the rainbow in the title), manga challenge (I exceeded my goal of 100, of course), 1st in a series challenge (I&rsquo;ve read 10 out of my goal of 20 since I last updated it), and off the shelf (read 30 books that you have but haven&rsquo;t touched, I&rsquo;ve only gotten 7 out of 30 although there are some books which I no longer own on that list).</p>

<p>What are the most memorable books of the year so far? Easy peasy!</p>

      <p>
        This manga series is incomplete but I've ready everything that is currently available to English readers. It is full of angst. To those who don't like angst, it may seem like it's unnecessarily angsty but I beg to differ. There can never be too much angst! It's not so much like your typical love story. The characters are extremely hard headed and you never know what they might do. There's always surprises about them that keeps you guessing and wanting to know more. Yeah, I stayed up until 3 in the morning reading this and bawling my eyes out (quietly though as not to wake the parents). </td> </tr> </table>

In true Steinbeck form, this short novel explores both loyalty and the transient nature of mankind. (Summary from &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodreads.com&quot;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

          &lt;p&gt;
            I read this book for English and I loved it. I read a review for the book once and the reader said, &quot;This book made me realize that the human mind's need for companionship is frighteningly scary&quot; or something along those lines. I agree wholeheartedly. To those who have not read this book (it's short and not that time consuming!), I highly recommend you read it. &lt;/td&gt;
