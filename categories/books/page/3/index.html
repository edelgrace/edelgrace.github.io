<blockquote>
<p>Name a book that changed your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Busting out the big questions. This is a hard one to answer. I think that I&rsquo;m still trying to find it. I have my favourite books but I&rsquo;m not sure of their impact on my life. They seemed to be entertaining books rather than books that held a lot of weight.</p>

<p>My first inclination was to think of any self help books I&rsquo;ve read but none come to my mind. Then I thought of my favourite book, <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Bronte. I relate a lot to the main character in this book and it made me extremely emotional, however I don&rsquo;t think I changed any more after reading it. I just really related to the character and it somehow reinforced my pessimistic outlook.</p>

<p>So to have an actual answer, I think the one book that changed my life was probably the very first book that I had ever read out of my own volition, even if I don&rsquo;t remember what that book could have been. Reading is such a big part of my life, I think my life would be very different if I had never taken up a book that I actually wanted to read and was not forced to read in school. Can you imagine a life without reading? Neither can I.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are at a really good point in a book and the phone rings or the door bell rings, do you stop reading or let the phone or door bell go unanswered?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I would get up and check them. Mostly because, in my mind, those things don&rsquo;t happen unless there is something important. Who actually calls people anymore? The only phone calls I get are usually important such as my bank, my doctor, etc. If someone is taking the time to visit my home, I will go look at the door. Nine times out of ten it is usually just a door to door salesperson but I won&rsquo;t let him in. Now if it was a text message, I will definitely let that go unanswered.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s rare for me to be so engrossed in a book that way. If it really is that good, I will probably let my brother or parents look at the door or answer my phone instead. Unless they yell for me to do it instead, haha!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After thirty years of marriage, producing three now-grown children, Mike and Anna have settled into entrenched domesticity. She is skillful and poised and still beautiful, an instructor of English at the city college. He is a successful graphic artist on the verge of retirement, his awards and ambitions and accomplishments largely behind him. Though the couple’s erotic life has dimmed somewhat, he still considers her ravishing.</p>

<p>But their apparent balance is thrown asunder when Anna breaks the normal silence of their breakfast table with uncontrollable babble about hummingbirds. After an emergency consultation with a neurologist, they have a diagnosis: confabulation, or the scrambling of time, memories and language due to a dangerous aneurysm in Anna’s brain that could burst at any moment.</p>

<p>Not knowing how much time they have left with the beloved Anna, Mike and the kids rally together to support her through the terror of her disintegrating mind. But the unbearable strain of the situation is worsened by another worry that is haunting Mike: he suspects that his two eldest children, Charlotte and Fred, know of his past infidelity.</p>

<p>Several years ago, Anna and Mike took a trip to Egypt, hoping the shared adventure would thwart their mid-life marriage blues. Instead, the trip deepened the chasm, his sexual jealousy and insecurities swamping her attempts at intimacy. Their estrangement worsened when they returned home to discover that their youngest daughter, Sasha, was in hospital, having overdosed on drugs. Anna was furious with Mike for his cool response at the time, which she interpreted as unfeeling.</p>

<p>Two weeks later Mike began his affair, with a much younger woman dissimilar to Anna in all respects. He persisted in the romance for three years, feeling young and vital and once again in control, at least for a time.</p>

<p>The affair is long over but today, as Anna disappears into a terrifying collapse of time and language, Mike is wracked by his dilemma: should he keep his silence about the affair and spare his family more pain, or should he seize the opportunity to be wholly honest with the woman he loves, possibly in the last days of her life? Perhaps the answer lies in his drawings, the means of communication with which he is most comfortable. Can he codify his emotions into pictures? Can he articulate his love and regret and sorrow to his wife – and to himself – without having to say the heart-rending words out loud?</p>

<p>Narrated by a terrified male protagonist whose deep yearning for forgiveness might only be granted by a woman in the grips of dementia, Tessa McWatt’s Vital Signs is a thought-provoking and mesmerizing literary accomplishment – a compassionate and visceral study of a marriage at the brink of catastrophe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I received this ARC copy of this book from First Reads back in like 2011 and I am completely glad I did. This book was the first First Reads books that I so desperately and truly wanted to win. I read the summary and immediately felt that this seemed like a book that I would love to pieces. I&rsquo;m glad that my first instinct wasn&rsquo;t wrong.</p>

<p>Around four hours ago, I looked into the mail and saw the package waiting for me. Immediately, I took it inside and opened it. Ever since then, I&rsquo;ve been reading it, taking a few breaks to write down what I thought about it as I read.</p>

<p>The very first few pages were emotional to me, and I knew how much of a ride I was in for. I fell completely in love with McWatt&rsquo;s writing. Everything was so beautifully written and captured me.</p>

<p>Every single one of the characters were incredibly real. Their feelings were real as well. It was heartbreaking to read but at the same time, some scenes were just so beautiful and touching.</p>

<p>I was incredibly moved by this novel. My only complaint however, are the pictures. I understand that the pictures serve an important part to the story, but they also distracted me from the story. They seemed very abrupt, and I didn&rsquo;t really like their placement. But, they were very well done. I just wish it didn&rsquo;t interrupt the flow as much. I did love the very last drawing though. It took me a while to figure out the meaning, but I came to love it.</p>

<p>Vital Signs is definitely a short and bittersweet read. I will have to make sure to buy it once it comes out. Spoiler alert, I eventually did years later under the impression that I never read it in the first place. Interesting how fate works. I re-read it and it was all extremely fresh to me. I am a little hurt that the book didn&rsquo;t leave an impact that would last over six years. However, I&rsquo;m glad I got to experience it again with a blank mind with little to no expectations.</p>

<p>At the moment, my side bar is laid out by links to my favourite bloggers, categories, monthly archives, and recent comments. I don&rsquo;t like to clutter my side bar with too much, especially images, so it&rsquo;s mostly all text. I love minimalist designs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To many readers, who have perhaps known Frankenstein only at second hand, the original may well come as a surprise. When Mary Shelley began it, she was only eighteen, though she was already Shelley&rsquo;s mistress and Byron&rsquo;s friend. In her preface she explains how she and Shelley spent part of a wet summer with Byron in Switzerland, amusing themselves by reading and writing ghost stories. Her contribution was Frankenstein, a story about a student of natural philosophy who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from bones he has collected in charnel-houses. The story is not a study of the macabre, as such, but rather a study of how man uses his power, through science, to manipulate and pervert his own destiny, and this makes it a profoundly disturbing book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shelley is a lot like her mother. They both love characters who talk and talk and talk.</p>

<p>Honestly, I did not expect most of what happened in this book. Everyone &ldquo;knows&rdquo; the Frankenstein story: mad scientist raises the undead in a creepy laboratory in the mountains during a thunderstorm. It usually seems to end there. Some variations, Frankenstein actually makes a &ldquo;female&rdquo; version and, usually, the female doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with its male counterpart.</p>

<p>However, I learned that Frankenstein is much more than that. It&rsquo;s a lot more gruesome and morbid than I thought it would be. I wouldn&rsquo;t really classify it as horrifying in any way. Honestly, I was a bit bored by many parts of it. I sympathized with Frankenstein&rsquo;s creation when he told his tale but it was still hard for me to picture him as anything but human.</p>

<p>I will say that I enjoyed how Shelley utilized the unreliable narrator. I can&rsquo;t believe sitting down with someone while they recounted a story as long as this.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I read it and got it out of the way but I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the book itself. I don&rsquo;t want to say &ldquo;it was okay&rdquo; AKA 2 stars because that implies there was something good about the book. Not to say there&rsquo;s anything bad but it just wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p>
