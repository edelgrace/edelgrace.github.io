<blockquote>
<p>Across seven dazzling tales, award-winning internationally best-selling author Haruki Murakami brings his powers of observation to bear on the lives of men, who, in their own ways find themselves alone. Some a trapped indoors, some in their own heads; they are chauffeured around in cars by silent women or haunted by the ghosts of women they once knew.</p>

<p>Here are lovesick doctors, students, ex-boyfriends, actors, bartenders, and even Kafka&rsquo;s Gregor Samsa, brought together to tell stories that speak to us all. In <em>Men WIthout Women</em> Murakami has crafter another contemporary classic, marked by the same wry humour and pathos that have defined his entire body of work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like Murakami&rsquo;s characters. What I mean by that is if his characters were real, I would probably hate them all. But&hellip; Murakami is really good at writing interesting characters. They may not be likeable or all too believable but they do grab your attention. <em>Men Without Women</em> is filled to the brim with those characters.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, these are the characters that I remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>A plain look female chauffer who drives an actor around</li>
<li>An actor who is driven around and retells his story of his wife and her lovers before she passed away</li>
<li>A lackadaisical wanderer who lets his friend go on a date with his girlfriend</li>
<li>A middle-aged man who never stays attached to any woman until it happens and his heart breaks and then he literally starves himself to death</li>
<li>A man who every single person he has dated eventually killed themselves</li>
<li>A woman who thinks she was an eel in a previous life</li>
<li>A Gregor Samsa if he was like a bug or something and wakes up as a human</li>
</ul>

<p>There is one story that really stuck in my mind from this book, <em>An Independent Organ</em>. Dr. Tokai is a plastic surgeon who is also a serial dater. He doesn&rsquo;t like commitment. All the women he dates usually have a husband or a boyfriend. He enjoys how casual and short-term his relationships are. Until, one day, he falls in love. The woman he falls in love with leaves him for another man and from his heartbreak, he slowly starves himself to death.</p>

<p>The whole &ldquo;my heart is broken time to die&rdquo; thing isn&rsquo;t what I took away from this story. At one point in the story, Dr. Tokai talks to the narrator about concentration camps. He talks about an accomplished, wealthy man with many hobbies who is suddenly thrown into a concentration camp and is stripped away of all the things that defined him. Dr. Tokai was fascinated at the man&rsquo;s existential crisis as a result of this. In some way, I think Dr. Tokai starved himself to find out who he really was.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I fully understood this logic when I first read it. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to starve, of course. How could that intense starvation ever bring you to who you really are? To me, there is nothing more human than the performing arts or working or cultivating a family. Maybe they&rsquo;re just distractions to keep us busy and our real personalities from ever being realized.</p>

<p>Even now, I keep thinking I get the meaning behind it but I feel like I keep falling short of it. Is it about coping with loss? Is it about not knowing how good you have it until you lose it? Is it about stripping away all the bullshit and confronting yourself? Or maybe Dr. Tokai was so madly in love that all reason left him and he starved away his sorrows. I refuse to believe that is what Murakami wanted to portray. Still. It made me think for a couple of good days.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy story is <em>Samsa In Love</em>. It&rsquo;s a tongue in cheek spin-off of Franz Kafka&rsquo;s <em>The Metamorphosis</em>. In the original, Gregor is a human who suddenly wakes up as a bug. In Murakami&rsquo;s story, Gregor is a non-human entity who suddenly wakes up as a human. Gregor experiences falling in love for the first time after he meets the locksmith&rsquo;s daughter. Nothing profound, in my humble opinion, but a good chuckle. I appreciate the reference.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this might be one of the better Murakami books I&rsquo;ve read. There a lot of hit and misses from Murakami and I just keep reading them because they&rsquo;re so familiar to me. I think this is worth reading, however. I never really like how Murakami writes women in his main novels. Admittedly, this anthology doesn&rsquo;t differ that much from his usual portrayals but it is a touch more down to earth than usual and that I definitely appreciate.</p>

<p>Also. How does Murakami write so much???</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you like to finish one book before starting the next or do you read several at once?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m notorious for reading several books at once but eventually it turns into reading one book at a time. I have a ton of books I&rsquo;ve started only to drop for another book instead. I wish I was a faster reader or had more time to read more books then I wouldn&rsquo;t feel the need to start so many books at the same time!</p>

<p>For example, there was a time where I would be listening to an audiobook while I was studying and then I would be reading a physical book during bus rides and then I would have an e-book that I would read while on the computer. Too many things going on at once!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What author do you not read and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right off the top of my head, I don&rsquo;t read Jodi Picoult <em>anymore</em>. I used to really like Jodi Picoult after reading <em>My Sister&rsquo;s Keeper</em> and I went on a binge just reading work after work. That was a mistake because I got tired of her writing very quickly. I stopped seeking her out and I don&rsquo;t think I would read another Jodi Picoult novel again unless someone recommends it to me. There&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with her writing (I enjoyed a lot of her novels) but they all seemed to be the same and I just had enough.</p>

<p>Other than Jodi Picoult, I can&rsquo;t really think of any other authors I don&rsquo;t read. I don&rsquo;t really discriminate by author. There are a lot of genres I don&rsquo;t like and therefore authors who write in those genres I don&rsquo;t read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While attending a traditional tea ceremony in the aftermath of his parents’ deaths, Kikuji encounters his father’s former mistress, Mrs. Ota. At first Kikuji is appalled by her indelicate nature, but it is not long before he succumbs to passion—a passion with tragic and unforeseen consequences, not just for the two lovers, but also for Mrs. Ota’s daughter, to whom Kikuji’s attachments soon extend. Death, jealousy, and attraction convene around the delicate art of the tea ceremony, where every gesture is imbued with profound meaning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The past will always follow you. The main character, Kikuji, learns this first hand in <em>Thousand Cranes</em>. After the death of his father, he is pursued by women from his father&rsquo;s past. There is Chikako, a mistress that his father did not see for long and who constantly meddles in Kikuji&rsquo;s personal affairs. Then there is his father&rsquo;s main mistress, Mrs. Ota, and her daughter, Fumiko. These three women are haunted by Kikuji&rsquo;s father and turn to Kikuji to express their guilt, shame, and envy.</p>

<p>What really captured me about this book was just how irritating these characters were. Chikako was just downright annoying with her constant pestering. Mrs. Ota seemed utterly useless, just crying and (the way I interpreted it) longing for Kikuji&rsquo;s dead father. I had some hope in Fumiko, who seemed like the most normal out of the three women despite her insistence on absorbing the shame of her mother&rsquo;s affair with Kikuji&rsquo;s father. Then there is Kikuji who does nothing and whose only purpose is to serve as a vessel to experience the stories of these three women. I have never disliked so many characters in one book. I also have never wished for redemption for the characters so intensely.</p>

<p>The real kicker about this little novel, however, is how it is written. Kawabata&rsquo;s prose is hauntingly beautiful. I could feel his words to the core. When Fumiko threw down the Shino, I could sense the desperation and the sorrow. I could picture this woman and the expression on her face, and how her arms would carry the burden of the Shino and fling it to the ground, heavy. It was such a delight to read.</p>

<p>I will say that I feel like I should be over the trope of the frail, overly emotional Japanese women who changes a man&rsquo;s perspective on life only to, in the end, commit suicide. I don&rsquo;t know why this is so prominent in the Japanese novels that I have read. It must be cultural and I can firmly say that I don&rsquo;t get it at all. It does make for good stories, even if it makes it a little infuriating.</p>

<p><em>Thousand Cranes</em> was a quick read and I devoured it. Admittedly, I picked this book up because I thought it was <em>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</em>. When I read the summary at the back of the book, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t that book at all but I decided to take it out anyway. I made a good choice, I think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever visited the location of a book you have read?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m Canadian and I rarely go out of my city. I have been the Philippines before and once spent a week in New York City. Not many books take place in the Philippines. I&rsquo;m sure I must have read books with New York City as a setting but I can&rsquo;t think of any off the top of my head. If there was a specific location in New York City, I don&rsquo;t think I would have been since I only visited a few landmarks.</p>

<p>I know that I would love to visit Prince Edward Island one day, from <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>. Avonlea is a fictional place, however, L.M. Montgomery wrote and took inspiration from the town Cavendish. Understandably, Cavendish has some touristy spots relating to <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> and I would definitely take a visit.</p>

<p>There are a couple of places that I would like to go to but they are more for general tourist reasons and not really for a bookish reason. Some of those places are Italy, Japan, Russia, etc.</p>
