<blockquote>
<p>You are suddenly transported into a future time in which (horrors!) books are unknown. How would you explain books, and how wonderful they are, to the people of that time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UH. That&rsquo;s so hard, especially since I don&rsquo;t really understand what is considered as horror. In my mind, horror just means &ldquo;scary.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a lot of similar genres like thrillers. I really do not know enough about the genre to say anything about it. Maybe I need to pick up Stephen King one of these days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the author of <em>The Vegetarian</em> and <em>Human Acts</em> comes a book like no other. <em>The White Book</em> is a meditation on colour, beginning with a list of white things. It is a book about mourning, rebirth and the tenacity of the human spirit. It is a stunning investigation of the fragility, beauty and strangeness of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Don&rsquo;t die. For God&rsquo;s sakes, don&rsquo;t die.</em></p>

<p>I picked this book up at my local library. There is a display at the front where other library patrons suggest a book on certain criteria. If you like plot, you might like this book. Or if you like suspense you might like this other book. Mampreet suggested this book if you like prose. They didn&rsquo;t put any reasons but I trusted them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve actually <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/book-review-the-vegetarian-by-han-kang/">read and reviewed</a> <em>The Vegetarian</em> as part of a mini book club that I was doing with a friend. Everyone who read it was a little flabbergasted by it. There was something very Murakami-esque about it. But I couldn&rsquo;t deny that I really liked the writing.</p>

<p><em>The White Book</em> is very minimal. The text is sparse but I imagine every single word was chosen very carefully. I can only imagine how the translator might have laboured over it. It&rsquo;s prose to a tee.</p>

<p>In this book, Kang writes about her sister who only lived for two hours. In it, she imagines what her sister&rsquo;s life would have been like if she had lived and if Kang had never been born. Kang also talks about living so that her sister could live and being haunted by her sister&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p>This is definitely an artsy concept kind of books. The design is a dead giveaway of it. There is a lot of whitespace on each page. Some passages only use one side of a page. There are random pictures scattered throughout. If you enjoy fancy prose but don&rsquo;t mind lack of direction, you could give it a shot.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t tell if I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. And I feel like I experienced some beauty for a little bit but nothing too special.</p>

Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting close to Halloween. If you HAD to read one of these two genres, which would you prefer  urban fantasy, or horror, and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea. I don&rsquo;t read either, honestly. I think the last horror story I read was <em>Frankenstein</em>. While it is the epitome of 19th century horror, I didn&rsquo;t really find it&hellip; horrifying. I also get super affected by suspense so I don&rsquo;t know if I would do well with horror. For example, I put down the book if things get too intense. Even if it&rsquo;s something simple and non-horror related like someone is caught cheating, I have to put down the book and catch my breath. Thankfully with reading, you can&rsquo;t really have any jump scares. It&rsquo;s just the suspense that will really get me.</p>

<p>As for urban fantasy&hellip; I don&rsquo;t really know what that means. I&rsquo;ve read a lot of sci-fi that might be urban&hellip; But not sure about fantasy. I usually don&rsquo;t like the tropes that occur in urban genres. I find a lot of urban books fall into the same pitfalls. I&rsquo;ve probably just not found a really good urban book yet.</p>

<p>So I guess my answer would be horror. I really don&rsquo;t like the urban genre and sub-genres, especially if they are YA. I could tolerate horror because, even if it does have the intention to scare, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that bad in terms of scary levels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At an isolated mountain hot spring, with snow blanketing every surface, Shinamura, a wealthy dilettante, meets Komako, a lowly geisha. She gives herself to him fully and without remorse, despite knowing that their passion cannot last and that the affair can have only one outcome. In chronicling the course of this doomed romance, Kawabata has created a story for the ages–a stunning novel dense in implication and exalting in its sadness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The summary of this book captures the essence of <em>Snow Country</em> perfectly. This book is dripping in implication. The characters are never straightforward. They all keep secrets or they are just distant enough from each other that you know as much as the narrator knows. Even if the characters state their feelings clearly, there is some hidden layer beneath the words that you know to be true. Honestly, all the implications kills me.</p>

<p>The sadness kills me as well. I was so emotionally affected by <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/book-review-thousand-cranes-by-yasunari-kawabata"><em>Thousand Cranes</em></a> that I immediately sought out another one of Kawabata&rsquo;s novels. There is something addicting about how Kawabata portrays sadness. Kawabata is no stranger to sorrow and he conveys it so beautifully.</p>

<p>I remember reading about Kawabata a while ago before I read any of his works. For some reason, I was reading about seppuku (might have been because one of my friends told me that samurais used to drink tea beforehand so they could empty their bowels before committing seppuku, cool fact) and I was reading about the last recorded instance of seppuku. The accomplished poet, writer, actor, and director Yukio Mishima was the last and he was a friend of Kawabata&rsquo;s. It is said that Kawabata was haunted by Mishima&rsquo;s ghost so much so that he in turn also committed suicide (although not by seppuku).</p>

<p>After reading <em>Snow Country</em> I went ahead and read some more about Kawabata. One article talks about his first love and how it fell apart. It was tragic.</p>

<p>While it seems so simple, two people are caught in a passionate but illicit affair, there is tragedy seeping in every single word, gesture, and thought in this book. It&rsquo;s hard for me to think about what even happens in this book because I was just so affected by it all.</p>

<p>Kawabata really knows how to write. I&rsquo;m losing my ability to write because I just can&rsquo;t come up with any words to describe it. I highly recommend it.</p>
