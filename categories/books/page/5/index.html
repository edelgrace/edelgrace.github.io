<blockquote>
<p>For fifty years, National Book Award winner Ursula K. Le Guin’s stories have shaped the way her readers see the world. Her work gives voice to the voiceless, hope to the outsider, and speaks truth to power. Le Guin’s writing is witty, wise, both sly and forthright; she is a master craftswoman.</p>

<p>This two-volume selection of almost forty stories taken from her eleven collections was made by Le Guin herself, as was the organizing principle of splitting the stories into the nominally realistic and fantastic.</p>

<p>Where on Earth focuses on Le Guin’s interest in realism and magic realism and includes eighteen of Le Guin’s satirical, political, and experimental earthbound stories.</p>

<p>Highlights include World Fantasy and Hugo Award winner “Buffalo Gals, Won’t You Come Out Tonight,” the rarely reprinted satirical short, “The Lost Children,” Jupiter Award winner, “The Diary of the Rose,” and the title story of her Pulitzer Prize finalist collection Unlocking the Air.</p>

<p>Stories in this volume were originally published in venues as varied as Playboy, TriQuarterly, Orbit, Redbook, and The New Yorker.</p>

<p>Companion volume Outer Space Inner Lands includes Le Guin’s best known nonrealistic stories. Both volumes include new introductions by the author.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love Ursula K. Le Guin. I <a href="(http://edelgrace.me/blog/inspiration-from-fictional-worlds)">wrote a post</a> about just how much she sparks my imagination and makes my insides tingle. I really enjoy her science fiction and I haven&rsquo;t read any of her &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; fiction. This is where the books title originates. <em>The Unreal and the Real</em> is a two volume anthology of Le Guin&rsquo;s short stories. The first volume, <em>Where on Earth</em>, is a collection of stories that do not have any science fiction elements in them.</p>

<p>This volume was actually a hit or miss on a couple of the stories. I can barely remember most of them however the ones that stuck out in my mind were: <em>Brothers and Sisters</em>; <em>Buffalo Gals, Won&rsquo;t You Come out Tonight</em>; and <em>Half Past Four</em>.</p>

<h3 id="half-past-four">Half Past Four</h3>

<p>I had already read this short story before. I own the book, <em>Unlock the Air and Other Stories</em>. The first time I read it, I was wholly confused. There were mini stories in this one story and the same characters were in each story. It seemed like their circumstances were different in each of the stories.</p>

<p>The introduction in <em>Where on Earth</em> really put the story in perspective. They were all separate and distinct stories despite having all the same characters. This was inspired from writing exercise Le Guin taught a class of poets: write a story about people with varying positions of authority.</p>

<p>Knowing the whole story now made me appreciate it much more. I don&rsquo;t know which mini-story I preferred the most. I liked how each story kept the main traits of the characters and it seemed to actually add to their personalities. It was interesting knowing how each character would act in different circumstances and relationships with each other.</p>

<p>Essentially there are four characters: Ella, Ann, Todd, and Stephen.</p>

<p>Ella is a woman who is either Ann&rsquo;s mother, step-mother, or sister. Ann is pregnant or a new mother and a sister to Todd or Ella or Stephen&rsquo;s daughter. Todd is Stephen&rsquo;s step-son or Ella&rsquo;s brother or Ella&rsquo;s son. Stephen is Ann&rsquo;s father or Ella&rsquo;s brother or the neighbour. It&rsquo;s all very complicated when I explain it like this but it&rsquo;s actually easy to keep track of.</p>

<h3 id="buffalo-gals-won-t-you-come-out-tonight">Buffalo Gals, Won&rsquo;t You Come Out Tonight</h3>

<p>This story was very different but also very Le Guin at the same time. A child survives a plane crash in the middle of the desert and is adopted by animals. These animals can talk and take the appearances of humans but are still very much animals. I love how Le Guin can capture the characteristics of these animals in a humanized way. For example, Coyote, is a wild and brash character, not unlike a real coyote. The animal society in the desert is also extremely fascinating.</p>

<h3 id="brothers-and-sisters">Brothers and Sisters</h3>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because <em>Brothers and Sisters</em> was the first story that I remember it very well. This is a story of two brothers, one pretty exceptional and the other a dreamer. Of course, in the middle of them is a girl. I was quite pleased with the outcome and while I grew to dislike some of the characters, I couldn&rsquo;t fault them for their personalities.</p>

<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>

<p>I liked this book quite a bit. There were some stories that I didn&rsquo;t particularly care for unfortunately but I enjoyed it nevertheless. I would give this book a solid <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. Le Guin is great with her words and I would recommend it to people who don&rsquo;t expect her science fiction. I think in the end I prefer her fantasy/sci-fi works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Susan Gordon Lydon was coping with a broken arm, her craft took on new significance. While knitting was essential to strengthening her hands, it also provided her with a newfound sense of peace and creativity. Immersed in brilliant colors, textures, and images of beautiful sweaters, Lydon found healing and enlightenment in a way she had never imagined. Capturing this journey of discovery, The Knitting Sutra recounts her remarkable membership in a community of craftswomen around the world, from sweater makers in Scotland to Navajo weavers, and the adventures that her craft led her on.</p>

<p>As she masters new techniques and conquers old obstacles, Lydon’s story conveys how the lessons she learned from knitting, such as stillness and interdependence, later sustained her through a cancer diagnosis and even the incapacitation of her hands. <em>The Knitting Sutra</em> is both a meditation on craft and an affirmation for anyone seeking heartfelt comfort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not actually a knitter. I mean, I knit, but I am in no means an actual knitter. It doesn&rsquo;t stop me from enjoying stories related to knitting.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought this would be a more of a workbook that would help guide you through spiritual knitting. When I deciding whether or not to take this book out of the library, I read a snippet. Nope, it seemed to be largely a memoir. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed but like I said, I enjoy stories related to knitting.</p>

<p>Lydon seems to be a very spiritual person. I didn&rsquo;t expect a knitter would be crossing the country seeking guidance from spiritual leaders. It was a bit out of the ordinary but I quickly grew to wish I had known Hayat and Jimmy and the likes. Lydon seems like a very well traveled and knowing person so I enjoyed following her around in her attempts to make peace with the spiritual.</p>

<p>Of course, the main lesson of the story is mindfulness. The main reason why I felt this book didn&rsquo;t satisfy me was because I didn&rsquo;t necessary learn anything new. While I do like how Lyndon approaches mindfulness, I was still left for wanting more.</p>

<p>What I appreciated the most however was her advice on knowing yourself. Several times throughout the book, Lyndon refers to making sweaters that never really appear like she thought they would. The sleeves would turn out too big or the garment would be slipping off her shoulders. It was best to make your own tweaks to patterns so that whatever you were making was fit for you. And mistakes were okay. Arabic weavers would often put in mistakes into their works because &ldquo;Nothing but Allah is perfect.&rdquo; I thought that was a good metaphor.</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>I give it a <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. This is not a book that I would come back to nor remember in a couple of years. It was well written and I enjoyed the content but it was ultimately lacking.</p>

<p>The difference between the knitting moments and the spiritual moments were too great at points. Some of the links between the two were too weak to justify. However, Lydon did make some good points throughout the book that kept me reading.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice quick read and the fact that it&rsquo;s so short justifies the time spent on it. Don&rsquo;t pass it up if you have the chance but you aren&rsquo;t missing much.</p>

<p>Do you prefer to blog about (a) specific book genre(s), or do you have an eclectic blog?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read a lot of genres and therefore my blog reflects that. So yes, I have an eclectic blog! When I pick books to read, I don&rsquo;t consciously pick something by the genre. I think I tend to read a lot of memoirs, historical fiction, and romance. Lately I&rsquo;ve been on a fantasy binge. Really, I don&rsquo;t know if there is a genre I would <strong>not</strong> read and then blog about!</p>

          </div>

          <p><p>My last semester was extremely busy. So busy that I spent my commute on the train sleeping everyday instead of my usual reading. I&rsquo;ll admit, most of my reading is done when I&rsquo;m on the train. So other than the occasional manga or cookbook, I hardly read the last couple months of last year. Which is devastating.</p>

<p>This year (like every year), I resolved to read more. I started out the year reading two non-fictional books about personal finance. Good insightful content but hardly stimulating.</p>

<p>On impulse, I was at the library paying fines (my water bottle exploded in my backpack and ruined a book, I&rsquo;m still a bit peeved) when I saw <em>Emily of New Moon</em> by L. M. Montgomery on the shelf. I had just finished watching <em>Anne</em> on Netflix and I needed another dosage of Montgomery goodness.</p>

<p>Reading through <em>Emily of New Moon</em> struck something within me. Whenever I read good literature, I always have an urge to write. I know that I will never be as good as the authors that inspire me, but most of the time I just want to write for the sake of posterity.</p>

<p>In <em>Emily of New Moon</em>, the main character (you guessed it, Emily) writes letters to her father as a sort of journaling mechanism. This made me long for my journal. I have tried writing journals many times but my anxiety of my mother reading my journal has made me hesitate each time. I see this blog as a sort of journal but I still have to censor myself as this is (obviously) public. I do admire those who can freely write in their blogs but it&rsquo;s hard for me to take that step especially since many of my thoughts are so personal.</p>

<p>Reading about this little girl writing so freely made me envious. I started to write a little more in a notebook.</p>

<p>Then I heard about the passing of Ursula K. Le Guin. It&rsquo;s been around a year since I first stumbled upon <em>A Fisherman of the Inland Sea.</em> I was completely enamored by the book. When I was younger, I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy. Things like <em>Dragon Rider</em> by Cornelia Funke, <em>The Old Kingdom</em> series by Garth Nix, <em>Harry Potter</em> (of course), <em>The Last Dragon Chronicles</em> by Chris d&rsquo;Lacey, etc. There was something about being immersed in a totally fictional and supernatural world that I found captivating.</p>

<p>Le Guin is a master at creating such worlds, although she tends towards science fiction rather than fantasy (in my opinion). Her world building is expansive and natural and oh so imaginative (I picture Anne of Green Gables saying a similar thing with her eyes wide and her hands clasped).</p>

<p>Two of my friends are currently taking a science fiction course where they will eventually read Le Guin&rsquo;s <em>The Left Hand of Darkness.</em> I&rsquo;ve read a couple of Le Guin&rsquo;s books (mostly compilations of her short stories) but haven&rsquo;t touched any of her more popular novels. Thanks to the power of Audible, I managed to get a free copy of the audiobook.</p>

<p>However, listening to Le Guin&rsquo;s words just isn&rsquo;t the same as reading them. Maybe it was the narrator but I couldn&rsquo;t get myself into it. There was one scene that I could pay attention to but when it came to the description of politics and the general world, I couldn&rsquo;t focus.</p>

<p>So I made a trip to my local library to scout for some more of her books. <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> is a popular book and the wait-list for it was thirty people long so I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be reading that any time soon. But I did manage to pick up one of her books that were decidedly not science-fiction, <em>The Unreal and the Real: Volume One: Where on Earth.</em></p>

<p>I had barely read through the introduction and the first sentence of the first chapter when I put the book down. I instinctively shivered and got out my notebook to essentially write most of what I have already written here. It was a special moment. Le Guin had captured me entirely.</p>

<p>In a way, I&rsquo;m jealous at how beautifully Le Guin seems to string along her sentences. I&rsquo;ve never really had a way with words, especially if they come out of my mouth. I have to think slowly and carefully and even in the written form, I&rsquo;m not as eloquent as I wish I could be.</p>

<p>Even though I could never hope to be a master of words like Le Guin and Montgomery, I can imagine. I can spin tales in my head and conjure up these characters that seem real to me. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to capture their essence in the written form but at least they&rsquo;re something that I&rsquo;ve created. I think having an imagination is a wonderful thing. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve imagined anything and I&rsquo;m glad that reading has started my mind up again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion. Her passive rebellion manifests in ever more bizarre and frightening forms, leading her bland husband to self-justified acts of sexual sadism. His cruelties drive her towards attempted suicide and hospitalisation. She unknowingly captivates her sister&rsquo;s husband, a video artist. She becomes the focus of his increasingly erotic and unhinged artworks, while spiralling further and further into her fantasies of abandoning her fleshly prison and becoming &#8211; impossibly, ecstatically &#8211; a tree.</p>

<p>Fraught, disturbing and beautiful, The Vegetarian is a novel about modern day South Korea, but also a novel about shame, desire and our faltering attempts to understand others, from one imprisoned body to another.</p>

I was a little shocked that a lot of people said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seek it out or make a point to find authors with a different point of view from mine.&rdquo; I think there is a lot of different voices out there that you need to seek out because their voices need to be heard.</p>

<p>One of my friends started up a book club, #milliesbookclub, that would explore Asian American authors and their works. Being Asian American myself (Asian Canadian to be exact), I was extremely interested. For minorities, it can be easy to have your voice drowned out. In general, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the literature industry regardless but it seemed important to intentionally seek out these Asian American authors. So out of this book club, <em>The Vegetarian</em> was chosen.</p>

<p>My first impression of this novel was that it was extremely Murakami-esque. Haruki Murakami almost always features peculiar women and these women almost always serve as some sort of motivator for the male protagonists. Murakami is frequently accused to using the manic pixie dream girl trope again and again and it was a little bit disappointing to see this again in another Asian author.</p>

<p>The male characters in this book were no different from how Murakami portrays his male characters. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s brother-in-law is obsessed with her to the point of his destroying his marriage and taking advantage of her mental vulnerability. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s husband forces himself upon her and selfishly only thinks of how her antics affect him. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s father was abusive to her for her entire life, even displaying physical aggression towards her in her adult life. It&rsquo;s no wonder that Yeong-hye retreats inward and pursues the notion that becoming a tree would bring the ultimate state of nirvana.</p>

<p>While I did find Yeong-hye&rsquo;s passion a little ridiculous and self destructive, I have finally come to the conclusion (with a little bit of help) that it boiled down to a form of escapism and served as a great foil to Yeong-hye&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>It maybe be obvious that Yeong-hye wasn&rsquo;t so keen on the life that she lived due to all of the not-so-great males she had around her. I still don&rsquo;t see the significance in becoming a tree but I do love how this demonstrates a positive attribute that Yeong-hye possesses which her sister does not.</p>

<p>Despite everything, Yeong-hye is true to herself. Compared to her sister, she is not a subservient and too obedient woman who is too polite to the point of irritation. Yeong-hye&rsquo;s brother-in-law makes this observation as he wonders why his wife would not lash out at him for his absenteeism in the family and instead becomes a little bit too accommodating. This is also shown when Yeong-hye&rsquo;s sister has a strong sense of duty towards her son which keeps her from succumbing to her depression whereas Yeong-hye is eager to let go of what little life she has left regardless of her obligations. Yeong-hye is more willing to break conventions as she only answers to herself.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, most of the other members of the book club didn&rsquo;t like this novel. I can see why. The male characters are disgusting and abhorrent. The fragile and subservient Asian woman stereotype is tiring. It&rsquo;s a frustrating read that reminds you that society is pretty much still patriarchal and misogynistic. It isn&rsquo;t empowering in the slightest, one of the aims the book club was created to begin with. Honestly, it&rsquo;s the last book that I would ever thing Millie would like to read. However, there was something fascinating about this book that never let me put it down until I finished.</p>

<p>I became invested in Yeong-hye and her sister. I could have skipped all the sections about Yeonh-hye&rsquo;s husband and brother-in-law easily. These two women wronged by the most important men in their lives struck a chord with me. The book made me want to know what became of the two sisters and how they could possibly rebuild their lives. I wanted to know what really went on their minds while we saw their husband&rsquo;s points of view and who they really were behind who the men thought they were.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think Han Kang made the right choice using male narrators for a good portion of the book because it really painted an accurate picture of the situation. However, it feels like she barely scratched the surface with the female characters but there was some sort of sense of redemption for the female characters.</p>

<p>If you can look past the social undertones in the book, I think it would be a good read. Most reviews I&rsquo;ve seen focused on the oddity and weirdness of the situation and less on the characters, which is fine but you&rsquo;ll never know how you feel about the book until you read it for yourself.</p>
