              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>This is very long overdue but I was blog hopping and came across <a href="https://thedailyprophecy.blogspot.ca">The Daily Prophecy</a> ran by Mel. Her <a href="https://thedailyprophecy.blogspot.ca/2017/01/7th-annual-end-of-year-survey-2016-part.html">latest post</a> was a quick survey of all the books she read in 2016. At the end of her post, she posed the question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the best book you read in 2016?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very tough question for me to answer. I read a couple of very good books this year. Some notable mentions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>1984</em> by George Orwell</li>
<li><em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte Brontë</li>
<li><em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen</li>
<li><em>Waiting</em> by Ha Jin</li>
<li><em>A Fisherman of the Inland Sea</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there were two books that really stood out to me this year: <em>Emma</em> and <em>Waiting</em>. I can&rsquo;t decide which was the better book for me.</p>

<p><strong>Waiting by Ha Jin</strong></p>

<p>This book tells the story of a man in an affair and a marriage that he cannot seem to get out of. He had been trying to divorce his wife for years so that he could marry the woman that he actually loves. However, he can&rsquo;t seem to get past the law and the pity he has for his wife and his daughter who live in near poverty.</p>

<p>This love story was extremely touching and it really made me think about marriage. One of my worst fears is marrying the wrong the person. Another one of my fears is getting married. What does it mean to marry a person? In the eyes of the law it&rsquo;s just seen as a formal union. To society, it may just be something you are expected to do and something to uphold at all costs. To others, it&rsquo;s something that you need in order to express your utmost love for another person.</p>

<p>Jin&rsquo;s voice is very authentic. As someone who is unfamiliar with the setting of the story, communist China in the 1960&rsquo;s, it was very easy to get a sense of the culture and values. His characters were sympathetic and their struggles were, although a bit out of place in the context of a modern Western society, very real. This book left a strong impression on my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Emma by Jane Austen</strong></p>

<p>I was immediately charmed by Emma. Although, she is a bit over the top (like her over confidence in her abilities and tendency to over analyze), it made her character all the more enjoyable. Her antics and the way she interacts with others is almost laughable, but all in good fun.</p>

<p>For someone so disinterested in marriage, marriage is all around Emma. Marriages are conducted in her presence and married are made from her presence (or so she says). Her meddlesome behaviour into other people&rsquo;s affairs opens her eyes to realize things about not only herself but of others too.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much that I can say about this book that is very thought provoking. Jane Austen adopts a light hearted and comedic tone with ease and the language of classic literature is always hard to resist. Overall, I think <em>Emma</em> made for great entertainment and was a fun book to read.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: The Best Book of 2016</strong></p>

<p>Even after writing all of this, I am still unsure. I think <em>Waiting</em> had more personal impact whereas <em>Emma</em> was a pleasure to lay my eyes on. I read stories to experience things that I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise. I read to be entertained, to think deeply, to feel, and to find bits of myself. Both of these books have hits and misses in this regard. Overall, I think I just might have to give the best book of 2016 to Ha Jin&rsquo;s <em>Waiting</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is everyday a reading day for you? Submitted by Elizabeth @ <a href="​http://silversolara.blogspot.com/">Silver&rsquo;s Reviews</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make it a habit of reading everyday. Realistically though, I only really read during the work week. Those days I specifically block out times for myself dedicated for reading: on the way to and from work (since I take public transportation). One day I&rsquo;d like to read everyday, but I still have a way to go.</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s your favourite place to read? Submitted by Ronyell @ <a href="http://rabbitearsbookblog.blogspot.com/">Rabbit Ears Book Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will be honest&#8230; I don&rsquo;t think I have a favourite place, as long as I&rsquo;m reading. In terms of places where I usually read is on the bus or when I&rsquo;m eating. I wish I had a better place to read, it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve sat down in a dedicated spot for reading at home.</p>

          <p><p>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&rsquo;s network&#8230; Kinda rough.</p>

<p>However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently doing an inventory of our gear and before I left for holidays, I was labelling items that needed to be recycled or sold. Apparently some of the labels fell off so I reinforced them all with tape. Since I was gone for two weeks, there were a couple of new devices in our inventory so I took note of those as well.</p>

<p>Some of the devices are strewn about the place with no order so I attempted to move some of them into groups of device types. For example, some of the supervisor engines were mixed with the switches when there was a shelf dedicated solely for engines.</p>

<p>We use bins to store smaller items. Some of the bins didn&rsquo;t have any labels so I had to make some in order for people to know where everything is. I also labelled some ambiguos boxes. It&rsquo;s a big guessing game looking at them all.</p>

<p>I received a package from Meraki containing a Meraki access point. Pretty cool! I thought that maybe I needed to do something with it for work so I read the manual but it turned out that it&rsquo;s mine to keep. It&rsquo;s super sleek.</p>

<p>In my co-op, I have to hand in reports in order to get credit. One of the first things I have to hand in during the start of the work term is learning objectives. I spent a good amount of time trying to think up of what I wanted to accomplish during this work term. I&rsquo;m still pretty undecided as I don&rsquo;t want to repeat myself from last term&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place. While he played Vermintide with friends, I continued reading <em>Buried in Books</em> by Julie Rugg. Basically it&rsquo;s a collection of quotes regarding books and reading. I love reading books about books and reading. What Ilove more is reading a book about books that are about books and reading.</p>

<p>After that we settled in for some quiet time to work on a puzzle I bought him for Christmas. It&rsquo;s a big 1000 piece puzzle of a volcano. I chose it because it was cool and dramatic and it was more than two colours. I guess some people like the challenge of putting together a puzzle of the ocean and the sky but not us.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my day in a nutshell. A very chill and relaxing day. Now I&rsquo;m hoping to tinker with the access point I received, work out a little, and study a bit for my CCNA before I hit the hay.</p>

          <h4>Dec 19, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/2017-reading-resolutions/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>This year I told myself I would read at least 25 books. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot but when you consider my reading history the past couple of years, that&rsquo;s a big number.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2015</strong>: 7 books + 3 graphic novels = 10 books</li>
<li><strong>2014</strong>: 19 books + 20 graphic novels = 39 books</li>
<li><strong>2013</strong>: 40 books + 30 graphic novels = 74 books</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong>: 18 books</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, not great numbers. Each year I have been reading less and less. 2013 was a weird anomaly. So far this year of 2016 (there&rsquo;s still like ten days left in the year&#8230;) I only managed to read 38 books, not including graphic novels. In total I&rsquo;ve read about 84 books. So that&rsquo;s still like 46 graphic novels that I&rsquo;ve read. I really wanted my novel to graphic novel ratio to be greater than or equal to one. However, I still met my goal of 25 books. So kudos to me!</p>

<p>This year I decided to opt for minimalism and not sign up for any reading challenges. To me, the most important thing is going through my to read list. If I even manage to make a small dent in the list, I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>

<p><strong>Here are my 2017 reading resoltuions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Read a total of 60 books.</li>
<li>Read at least 30 non-graphic novels.</li>
<li>Read more novels than graphic novels.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take out any books from the library that are not in my to read list.</li>
<li>Read at least half of the books on my 25 books to read in 2017 list</li>
</ul>
