 I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Wednesday to come around so I&amp;rsquo;m doing my WIP Wednesday now.
Right now I&amp;rsquo;m working on a shawl for one of my best friends. Just last week, my friend told me that she had cancer. She has had problems with her thyroid for a very long time and her family doctor never did anything about it despite her concerns.</description>

      <description>WIP stands for a &amp;ldquo;work in progress.&amp;rdquo; As an avid crafter and generally creative person, I always have at least one WIP!
 This year I&amp;rsquo;m doing a temperature blanket for real. My inspiration comes from Sakaane who is also doing a temperature blanket. I deliberated over how I wanted to make the blanket. I already had a ton of squares but I know myself too well. I would never get around to joining all those squares and weaving in all those ends.</description>

      <description>My brother got me a yarn winder for my birthday last week and yesterday I spent the afternoon winding some yarn while watching Medici: Masters of Florence on Netflix.
  Yarn that has been winded    I just finished a block week course (a week long course ) on history of early modern Europe and I was bit by the Rrenaissance bug. Historial fiction is one of my favourite genres across multiple media.</description>

      <description>In my last post I talked about making my boyfriend a scarf. I started it yesterday after showing him a couple of sample swatches. Out of all the scarves I showed him, he liked this one of a crochet Outline Ribbed Scarf. It&amp;rsquo;s a rather simple scarf which is nice because it&amp;rsquo;ll work up quickly. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the scarf by his birthday.
Here are some pictures of the test swatches I made.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s my boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday coming up soon. I wanted to make him a knitted or a crocheted item because I need something to keep my hands busy. Plus aren&amp;rsquo;t handmade things the sweetest thing you could get as a present??
On some level, I know he&amp;rsquo;s a little picky about what kind of things he would like to wear. To avoid spending a ton of time working on something that he might not ever wear, I sent him a couple links to patterns of scarves and toques.</description>

      <description>FO stands for &amp;ldquo;finished object.&amp;rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&amp;rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!
Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn.</description>

      <description>I finally finished one Bernat Blanket Stripes cake! I am going to move onto cake number two for my afghan ripple blanket. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know yet who this blanket will be for. My mom keeps asking me and I can&amp;rsquo;t make up my mind. I am pretty happy that I am making progress on this blanket. I might need three cakes for this though and not the two that I have.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Yesterday opened up at their new location across the street. I dragged my brother along with me to the opening.
It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&amp;rsquo;t win anything from but that&amp;rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&amp;rsquo;s great!</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I went to Drumheller with the family. Up to this point I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&amp;rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&amp;rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</description>

      <description>While I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for a job this summer (which is almost halfway over already&amp;#8230; Blah!) I took a cue from Y who started to work on some side projects and I decided to be a little more productive. Since I have a free month of Udacity from the GitHub Student Pack. Udacity is basically an online learning hub where you can take courses that are related to the tech field.</description>

      <description>FO means &amp;ldquo;finished object&amp;rdquo; in crochet and knitter terms. So any completed project is a finished object!
 After making my first granny square, I quickly made my second granny square. Both were made from Loop &amp;amp; Threads yarn of the wool variety. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact name of the yarn.
I am not quite sure about the colour choices but they were the colours I had on hand of the same yarn.</description>

      <description>Since I recently started making a temperature blanket. I bought a couple of skeins of yarn (Bernat Premium, they are so soft!) and decided to wind them into balls to make transporting them easier for when/if I&amp;rsquo;m on the go. Surprisingly, it takes a while for them to wind up. I thought it was a perfect opportunity to watch some TV shows while doing it.
I decided to finish up watching season 2 of Knights of Sidonia, an anime about a human space colony at war with alien-like creatures.</description>

      <description>I went to the first pancake breakfast of the season with my family the other day. It was close to home which was a great bonus because my dad had the car for work. The breakfast wasn&amp;rsquo;t busy at all but maybe being fairly early was a factor. They only served pancakes and sausage patties but they were pretty good! There was also a Tim Hortons truck giving out free coffee and hot chocolate.</description>

      <description>A post shared by Edel Altares (@edelgraceme) on Jul 5, 2017 at 3:41pm PDT   Since the beginning of July, I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording the highs and lows of the daily temperature through granny squares. The middle colour represents the low of the day and the outer colour represents the high of the day. The first three days of July were roughly the same but the fourth was a little bit cooler.</description>

      <description>I am just starting to get into knitting as well and I decided to buy a relatively cheap set of bamboo knitting needles. I found this LIHAO Bamboo set on Amazon for around $16.99 CAD. Included are 18 pairs of needles ranging from 2.0mm to 10.0mm. It also came with a knitting gauge which is super helpful!
From a quick look over, there are no obvious defects. The reviews say that they are perfect for beginners so we&amp;rsquo;ll see!</description>

      <description>Last week was the end of final exams and on my last exam, I decided to take a well deserved day out. In celebration of Canada Day, Tim Hortons was bringing back Roll Up the Rim for a time. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to cut down on my coffee but I decided to get at least one cup, just to try my luck. Turns out that my luck isn&amp;rsquo;t that so great.</description>

      <description>I went to visit another local yarn store called Gina Brown&amp;rsquo;s. I was in the area waiting to meet up with some friends and decided to pop in and check the place out. It&amp;rsquo;s way too convenient that this place is a ten minute walk away from a train station.
It&amp;rsquo;s a nice store. In the back there&amp;rsquo;s a big table available for classes and (I&amp;rsquo;m assuming) to just knit or crochet.</description>

      <description>I have been going to the Brentwood Village Mall for the past couple of years now and I have never ever noticed this nice little yarn store before until I started up crochet. The Knitting Room is a small store located in a mall close to my university. I usually go to the mall when I&amp;rsquo;m itching to walk somewhere between classes. I decided to finally visit The Knitting Room for the first time and came away with some yarn!</description>

      <description>Since I recently took up crochet, I have also been itching to start learning how to knit as well. I figure it would be advantageous to take up both of the more well known fiber art hobbies. So I signed up for lessons at one of my local yarn stores.
The store itself is very cozy and quaint. It&amp;rsquo;s literally a small house filled to the brim with yarn. The people at the front desk are extremely nice and while I was waiting for class to start, they offered me some tea.</description>

      <description>Hooked on Crochet is a Discord server that I am a part of. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Discord is, it is essentially a chat client for gamers. You can create your own &amp;ldquo;servers&amp;rdquo; or chat rooms for dedicated topics. Hooked on Crochet is (obviously) a group of crocheters. They organized a yarn swap last spring which I took a part of.
My gifter got me a set of hand dyed Alpaca yarn, a llama stitch marker, and a pattern for a unicorn amigurumi!</description>

      <description>My previous FO was part of the March National Crochet Month and this one is no different. Except this event is a charity run. This square will be going to a charity to be part of a blanket! Different squares from different people will all be sewn together. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a cool joint effort!

It took me a swatch to get the hang of making a granny square. Thankfully the process is straightforward.</description>

      <description>March is National Crochet Month. A group on Ravelry holds a series of events during the month to celebrate. One of these events is a mystery crochet along! Basically, the finished product is a mystery and parts of the pattern is slowly released throughout the month.
There were times I fell a little behind the clues but I managed to finish it off! Honestly, I find it a little bit derpy but that&amp;rsquo;s part of it&amp;rsquo;s charm.</description>

      <description>I decided to make a baby blanket for my cousin who is due in June. I bought a ton of Bernat Blanket skeins for this project. There is a big sale going on at Michael&amp;rsquo;s so I kept getting discount after discount. Which is good because I could never imagine buying this many skeins of Bernat Blanket at full price. I may have actually bought too many. I did buy one skein at Walmart though.</description>

      <description>I made this little bag mostly while playing the MMO Blade &amp;amp; Soul, hence the title &amp;ldquo;Perpetually Loading.&amp;rdquo; My computer is a bit of a toaster so I managed to get a lot of crocheting done while on the loading screen. Sometimes my game would crash on the loading screen and that would mean even more crocheting for me! Unfortunately, this worked out to the disadvantage of my SO who I was playing with at the time.</description>

      <description>I recently found out that there was a Michael&amp;rsquo;s near my workplace. Rookie mistake. After work, I walked over to the store. It&amp;rsquo;s a 20 minute walk in an area with absolutely no sidewalks. The snow hindered me a little bit but not enough to make me turn away!
Okay, this is actually my second Michael&amp;rsquo;s yarn trip but the first time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy a single thing. I just went to check out the place and see the different kinds of brands they had.</description>

      <description>This next dishcloth I made was a simple green dishcloth with single crochets. What initially drew me to the pattern was that the texture of the dishcloth was very pretty. I was surprised to know that the variance in texture was simple due to changing which loop you inserted the hook in! While it isn&amp;rsquo;t completely perfect, by the time I finished this I felt a lot more confident in my single crochets.</description>

      <description>I made a post about participating in Crochet Along Together (CAT) to make a three colour cowl and the yarn I ordered for the project finally arrived! It was good timing too because the event started the next day. I was getting a little worried that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t arrive in time.
Despite the discount I got on the yarn due specifically to the CAT (the CAT was sponsored by this brand, I think), it was kind of pricey for me.</description>

      <description>When I bought my crochet hook set, I needed to buy an additional $15 worth of products so I could get free shipping. It saved me around five dollars and there was no point in getting hooks without any yarn.
Unfortunately, they shipped it separate from the hooks but I had bought yarn from Walmart in the meantime while waiting for my things to arrive.
So here is the skein of yarn I got from Amazon.</description>

      <description>The group []() on Ravelry are holding an MCAL (Mystery Crochet Along) which I am taking part of. The project is an amigurumi. I have never made an amigurumi before and this will be my first! It will be interesting seeing that I have no idea what the finished project will look like. These are the first two clues finished. I still need to start clue 3 and 4, I&amp;rsquo;m a little behind.</description>

      <description>On February 26 I finished my very first project! It&amp;rsquo;s only a simple dishcloth as I&amp;rsquo;m just starting out. I know the colours are kind of garish but I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d be using them together until I actually started working on it. I can see some of the mistakes I made, and there are many, but I am extremely happy with how it turned out and I had a lot of fun making it.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, I recently took up learning how to crochet. Since March is National Crochet Month, &amp;nbsp;I decided to take part in some of the activities that are being held at Ravelry.
MCAL (Mystery Crochet Along)
This is an event that reveals the pattern slowly, clue by clue. The only hint is that it&amp;rsquo;s an anigurumi made out of three colours. This will be my first amigurumi so I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited but also anxious that it won&amp;rsquo;t turn out well.</description>

      <title>Crochet Haul #2: Cheap Crochet Set</title>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m just starting out with crocheting, I bought a somewhat cheap crochet set on Amazon. I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to buy high end luxury tools if I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I want to continue crocheting. I do think it would be a worthy hobby to take part in!
The case itself is seriously cute. The brand seems to be Merrywindix but I can&amp;rsquo;t quite tell. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot smaller than I expected which is great, that means it&amp;rsquo;s extremely portable.</description>

      <title>Crochet Haul #1: Starting the Crochet Journey</title>

      <description>Right now I&amp;rsquo;m in a quest to find a hobby that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve sitting in front of a screen. I recently started learning the guitar and now I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to add crocheting onto my plate. I have always been secretly envious of those who can knit and/or crochet. I love it when someone busts out a project their working on while on the bus and train. I also adore the small little crocheted toys that I see around the net.</description>
