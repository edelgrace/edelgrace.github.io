          <p><p>My brother got me a yarn winder for my birthday last week and yesterday I spent the afternoon winding some yarn while watching <em>Medici: Masters of Florence</em> on Netflix.</p>

<p>I just finished a block week course (a week long course ) on history of early modern Europe and I was bit by the Rrenaissance bug. Historial fiction is one of my favourite genres across multiple media. Over the winter break, I even watched <em>The Crown</em> and <em>Downton Abbey</em> on Netflix.</p>

<p>Thank goodness for Netflix. I find Netflix a great way to multitask on crochet projects. I started on this <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lost-in-time">Lost in Time shawl</a>. The crochet Discord server I&rsquo;m a part of has this for our January crochet along. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun so far! I&rsquo;m not sure how closely I&rsquo;m following it though. I had to redo the popcorn bits a couple of times.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I went to a nice Korean BBQ place with my SO. It was my first time trying bi-bim-bap and it was sooo delicious.</p>

<p>Overall my week was pretty low key. Spent most of it on school related matters and yarn matters.</p>

<p>This week my goals are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Continue not buying food on campus. Last week I was successful so hopefully I can replicate my results.</p></li>

<li><p>Draft up two blog posts. This is one of them so I&rsquo;m already halfway through!</p></li>

<li><p>Finish my first draft of my &ldquo;essay&rdquo; that I have to do for my history course. It&rsquo;s such a slow grind.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Until next time!</p>

          <p><p>In my <a href="/blog/productive-distractions/">last post</a> I talked about making my boyfriend a scarf. I started it yesterday after showing him a couple of sample swatches. Out of all the scarves I showed him, he liked this one of a crochet <a href="http://www.fiberfluxblog.com/2013/01/free-crochet-patternoutline-ribbed-scarf.html">Outline Ribbed Scarf</a>. It&rsquo;s a rather simple scarf which is nice because it&rsquo;ll work up quickly. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll finish the scarf by his birthday.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures of the test swatches I made. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if he wanted the simple one stripe line like in the pattern so I did a couple of each.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-01.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-02.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-03.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p>When I sent the pictures to my boyfriend, he said he liked all of them. Which wasn&rsquo;t too helpful for me but at least he is not opposed it so far. Thankfully that section of the scarf doesn&rsquo;t come up for a while since it is worked horizontally.</p>

<p>Yesterday I just chained around 300 chains to start off the scarf and finished around two rows. I think I made it a little too long. My boyfriend is like 6&rsquo; and I made the scarf to be a couple more inches longer than that. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>The colours were chosen by my boyfriend himself. There&rsquo;s a game that we&rsquo;ve been playing together called Warframe and the colours he chose were the colours of one of his characters that we play. If you don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://warframe.com">Warframe</a> is a free-to-play online third person shooter. It&rsquo;s a good grind for those who like that kind of games. It reminds me a lot of Destiny!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I made the scarf too long and I had to frog all of my work. I managed to get back to where I was then the yarn tangled on me. Now I have untangle it&hellip; Such is life.</p>

          <p><p>It&rsquo;s my boyfriend&rsquo;s birthday coming up soon. I wanted to make him a knitted or a crocheted item because I need something to keep my hands busy. Plus aren&rsquo;t handmade things the sweetest thing you could get as a present??</p>

<p>On some level, I know he&rsquo;s a little picky about what kind of things he would like to wear. To avoid spending a ton of time working on something that he might not ever wear, I sent him a couple links to patterns of scarves and toques. I may have added a few slouchy beanies in the list of links because I think he would look really good in a slouchy beanie. Lo and behold, out of all the links I sent him, he liked the one non-slouchy beanie the most. I&rsquo;m not annoyed or anything but I am pretty amused. I love little moments like these.</p>

<p>To be honest, there are a ton of projects that I should be working on instead of thinking of this (to name a few, school assignments). However this is one of those things that I call a &ldquo;productive distraction.&rdquo; Writing this blog post is a productive distraction in itself.</p>

<p>I even had a productive distraction between thinking that I needed to write this post and actually starting to write it. I was originally planning to write only a short paragraph. Then I wondered if I should separate long form blog posts with my status-like blog posts. I turned to <a href="https://jack.baty.net">Jack Baty</a> for some inspiration. I really admire the web presence that Jack has and I like his gutso for mixing microblogging with regular blogging. The stream of consciousness approach is something that I really would like to emulate.</p>

<p>So I went to his website. Then I found myself on a couple of other websites. Now I have more things on my to-do list.</p>

<p>I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on <a href="https://pattern-paradise.com/2016/09/26/free-crochet-pattern-alpine-nights-beanie/">Alpine Nights</a> because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty. It also came with a child sizing which was perfect.</p>

<p>The yarn I used was Red Heart Super Saver in Candy Print. My cousin&rsquo;s daughter specifically requested pink and I figured this would be quite a cute colour combination and not too boring if it was just one solid colour.</p>

<p>It took a couple of hours for me to finish it. The pattern is very straight forward. I made a mistake in not turning (switching direction) every row so I had to restart a couple of times. I did make it a couple of rows shorter than the pattern specified because it was getting a little bit too big.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it. Even though I made it shorter, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s still big for my cousin&rsquo;s daughter. Since it seems like she grows each time I see her, I hope it would be okay for her to grow into it. We&rsquo;ll see if she likes it as much as I do!</p>

          <p><p>A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!</p>

<p>Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn. He made a &ldquo;bunny&rdquo; and asked me to give it eyes and a nose. I tried my best with what I was given. I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied but my cousin was so impressed. I love how innocent he is.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking how fast he&rsquo;s growing up. He just recently turned 11 and he&rsquo;s already almost as tall as me! Now that he&rsquo;s older he&rsquo;s less receptive to my affections which is a little disheartening to me since he is still so cute and sweet!</p>

<p>If I never have kids, I&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d be content with it because I am surrounded by kids in my extended family and I&rsquo;ve already watched many of them grow up. We celebrated my cousin&rsquo;s birthday over the weekend. She just turned 19 and I still marvel over how it seemed like she was a small little girl just yesterday. The same goes for her brother. He&rsquo;s going into grade twelve this year and I just can&rsquo;t believe it. We went to a night market at our mall recently and my brother, cousin, and I just walked around by ourselves talking. It&rsquo;s amazing to me how he has grown into his own person. Of course, while we were there, we got to chow down on some delicious food. I got a burger at Bandit Burger and it was absolutely delicious.</p>

<p>The next day we went to the park to celebrate my cousin&rsquo;s birthday and we spent almost eight hours there. There was a lot of eating and we took a walk and just chatted together. We even took a nap under the tree from the food overload. It was pretty relaxing and I even sat by the water&rsquo;s edge to knit for a little bit.</p>

<p>One of my older cousins saw me knitting and asked if I could make her daughter a hat. I said yes! I&rsquo;m a little nervous because I&rsquo;ve never had anyone ask me to make anything before but I would love to make my second cousin a hat. My cousin&rsquo;s daughter requested that it be pink. I have no pink yarn! I guess I&rsquo;ll be shopping around for pink yarn soon.</p>
