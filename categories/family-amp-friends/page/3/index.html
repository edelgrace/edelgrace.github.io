          <p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This was queued to be posted on Halloween. But I accidentally queued it for Halloween&hellip; LAST YEAR. *facepalm* Better late than never.</p>

<p>My iPod&rsquo;s broken. AHHHHHHHHH! I do most of my surfing, blog commenting, and posting on my iPod because I don&rsquo;t have access to my laptop most days. My parents only give me the laptop when I can whole heartedly prove to them that I have homework to do on the laptop. So I haven&rsquo;t been posting or anything for a while. I have been updating my Twitter and Tumblr on my phone but I can&rsquo;t go on any other websites unless I want a gigantic bill at the end of the month. Ah, whatever. Right now I&rsquo;ve finished all my homework and I&rsquo;m rushing to finish this post. Oh no, rushing is never good but forgive me.</p>

<p>So last week, I went to Screamfest for the very first time with my friends. Screamfest is an annual Halloween event where people 16+ have a good excuse to scare people who paid money to get scared. My friends have been asking me to go for the past four years but every year my parents have said no. Finally, they said yes this year. I kinda used the &ldquo;this will be our last halloween together before we all go away for university&rdquo; and I think it worked.</p>

<p>On our way to Screamfest, there was major traffic. Then my dad missed the turn to go into the venue. I kinda laughed at him as we tried to find an exit to bring us back to the intersection. When we finally got there, my dad dropped me off, we got our tickets, and we went in.</p>

<p>Screamfest is held at COP, the Canada Olympic Park in my city. It&rsquo;s a rather large place. During the winter people would ski down the hills and such. There&rsquo;s this section of the park that is reserved for things like sledding or more accuratley, luging. The entrace to the actual event was under the luging track and it definitely set the mood. It was dark and the stairs were creaky. Once you emerged from the mini-tunnel, there was a 5 minute walk along a path with mostly trees. We were walking and then this hooded guy dressed as grim reaper jumped out at us. We saw him and we knew he was coming but we screamed anyway.</p>

<p>We heard the loud thumping of a song and we knew we were close. We walked down another set of stairs to be greeted by a large group kids, a tent, a large bon fire, and a couple of those fair like haunted trailers. Screamfest staff walked around in their costumes, coming up behind people and scaring them. The chainsaw guy (we affectionately called him that the whole evening) stood on the fence that divided the lines for the trailers and waved his chainsaw in the air. It was a sight to see. And it was cold.</p>

<p>First we walked into the tent. It was really warm in there and there were strobe lights everywhere. Inside the tent were booths. Game booths, t-shirt booths, and (to much of my delight) comic book booths. Marie went to grab some grub and me and Sam looked around. There was a hot shirtless guy dressed as an angel holding up t-shirts. He was hot but I felt absolutely cold looking at him. How could he be shirtless in such a cold city??</p>

<p>After Marie finished her hot dog, we walked out of the tent and watched a couple performers on the mini stage. Most of them involved fire. A lady danced with a fire hula hoop and another lady had fire fans. It was interesting but we got bored quickly. We stood around for a bit and checked our phones. I put mine away and looked at the ground. Suddenly Marie said &ldquo;Oh hello,&rdquo; over her shoulder. I looked behind expecting someone we knew but instead this guy caked with skull makeup, piercings, and spiked up hair was staring at me. It was freaky but I then concluded that he was a bit hot looking. After he left, we went back to staring at our feet. Then Sam suggested we go into a haunted house.</p>

<p>The first one we went to was 3D. OMG 3D. They gave us 3D glasses, haha. And it was clown themed too. It wasn&rsquo;t that scary but I refused to be the first one inside. There was a few moments when me, Marie, and Sam fought over who would go first. It was fun.</p>

<p>We stood a while around the clown house when that scary yet hot skull boy came back. He walked up to me and stared. It was scary than the first time because I noticed his contacts. They were like glow in the dark green. And not cool glow in the dark green but like white that glows faintly green in the dark. Then he took a step forward and I stepped back. But then he turned hot again and licked his lips. He just had to go and ruin the illusion. I enjoyed being scared.</p>

<p>Then we went into another haunted house. It wasn&rsquo;t that scary and Marie and Sam forced me to go first. And so I did. It was really dark and I had no idea where to go. Thankfully there was a couple in front of us and we sheepishly followed them.</p>

<p>After we emerged from the house, the skull guy creeped behind us again. And twelve year old girls were hitting on him. And taking pictures of him. Lol.</p>

<p>Soon after, some of my other friends came. We stood in line for the maze. I was feeling really queasy because the smell of the smoke doesn&rsquo;t agree with me. We waited in line for a looooong time and I just wanted to puke. I kept it down but just as we entered the maze, my dad called me saying that he was waiting for me in the parking lot. So I basically ran through the maze clinging onto Luke&rsquo;s shirt. Luke is a scardycat but after the maze he said that he felt manly because I was clinging on to him for the whole time. Is that a compliment or&hellip;?</p>

<p>After that I went home. It was fun. Definitely going again next year!</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Yesterday was Thanksgiving in Canada land. I wasn&rsquo;t able to post because of our super long but extremely satisfying dinner. Turkey, ham, and pasta for all! Not to mention that there was no school yesterday.</p>

<p>I said I was going to create passwords and give them out but that never really happened. It will happen <strike>sometime this week</strike> when I get around to it.</p>

<p>Today was rather interesting. Everyone was talking about post post. In our marching band, there&rsquo;s a tradition of having a post party. The party consists of all the band kids from the previous year. It&rsquo;s like a reunion. I wasn&rsquo;t able to go because I wasn&rsquo;t in band last year (I won&rsquo;t be able to go next year either because I&rsquo;m not in marching band this year).</p>

<p>The actual post party is pretty fun. I went to post last year. You dress up a fancy, have a big dinner with food brought in by everyone, watch last year&rsquo;s performance, and give out awards (sexiest music section, mr and mrs tan lines, biggest should be couple, etc), all in the band room.</p>

<p>But post post is what most people look forward to. It&rsquo;s post free post. The post party after the post party. That&rsquo;s where all the good stuff is (or so I&rsquo;ve heard). I&rsquo;ve never been to post post. Basically, you get drunk or stay sober and watch drunk people do stupid things, or watch other sober people get stupid things done to them.</p>

<p>Now because I believe in obeying the law (the band members are all grade elevens, twelves, first year university students, or right out of high school workers AKA mostly underaged kids), I never went to post post last year. Plus the appeal of getting drunk for the sake of getting drunk is nonexistent. Okay, some drunk people do funny things, but it&rsquo;s not that great when people start throwing up everywhere.</p>

<p>Today everyone was talking about post post and all the hilarious things and I just felt like face palming (although some of the stories were amusing). I was also feeling a bit left out but that&rsquo;s really besides the point. I don&rsquo;t tolerate stupidity very well from most people. Especially my friends. Ack, what can you do? I&rsquo;m like the only senior band geek who has not been drunk in her whole entire life yet. I enjoy being able to truthfully say that.</p>

<p>But more about today. There was no band practice this morning, so I slept in. When I got to school, I walked into the band room to be greeted by the grade ten woodwinds playing Christmas songs. Normally, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind listening to Christmas songs even before Halloween is over but the grades tens were just butchering it. My ears are not used to such musical profanity.</p>

<p>In math, we got our quizzes back. I got one question wrong and it&rsquo;s because I forgot to convert radians to degrees. I hate making silly mistakes like that because it&rsquo;s just like, I could have easily gotten a hundred! My mat teacher also makes you feel stupid when you make mistakes like that, so it didn&rsquo;t help me feel any better. But my math teacher was making more jokes than usual today. Maybe he was happy from the Thanksgiving dinner. I quite enjoy my math teacher actually.</p>

<p>Physics was bad. We had to convert graphs into another type of graph. It was so easy but my teacher takes half a class for us to work on things that should only take ten minutes. And then he says &ldquo;Oh you have a unit test next week&rdquo; when we&rsquo;ve barely learned anything. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to pass this course.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have my favorite subject! Chemistry. Chemistry was fun but not. We went over our quizzes, which I got 75% on. Blergh. I do not do well with oxidation numbers. However after we did that, we did a lab. A titration lab! I love titration labs. Especially watching the solutions change into one color and then quickly fade away multiple times. It&rsquo;s just like, &ldquo;Is it going to say pink? Yes? Yes? Oh, just kidding.&rdquo; I love chem labs.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was my day. I only had math homework so it was a pretty slack day. I enjoy and fully cherish this semester.</p>

          <p><p>So I have vowed to write at least something everyday for this school year to document my final year in high school. Some of it will be published, some not. I also know most people don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;this is what I did this whole entire day&rdquo; kind of posts but it is my blog, and well, I&rsquo;ll blog whatever I want. :]</p>

<p>To start things off, today was rather ordinary. I woke up painfully early at six in the morning (well, it&rsquo;s early if you&rsquo;ve been sleeping in until noon for two months) because I heard my mom cooking. After an hour of trying to go back to sleep, my brother comes in to give me a kiss since he leaves earlier than me. That just woke me up even more.</p>

<p>So I stayed in bed for another two hours and finally started to get ready. I can still smell the wonderful scent of bacon right now. Anyway, getting ready was rather quick. I spent the next two hours playing around on the computer and then headed out to school.</p>

<p>The school wasn&rsquo;t empty but it was mostly grade elevens. The grade twelves didn&rsquo;t have to come for another hour so I was pretty early. I don&rsquo;t know many grade elevens so all I did was walk around the school until I found people I knew. Of course, they were in the band room.</p>

<p>After mingling and giving out hugs it was finally to go to our teacher advisor. I had a new one because my former teacher advisor retired. I&rsquo;m glad he did because he was grumpy and short tempered all the time. My new teacher advisor was young and very friendly. I like her. A very big change from my former one.</p>

<p>Then it was picture time. I waited for like twenty minutes to get my picture taken in the gym. I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether or not we were supposed to return to class after the picture because all my friends were waiting for me outside the gym. They all told me that their TAs said that they could leave right after their pictures so I was like okaaaay, I&rsquo;m trusting you guys and I&rsquo;m going to leave with you.</p>

<p>The bus ride home was awkward though. One of my friends is homosexual. Her former girlfriend just recently broke up with her and now her mom&rsquo;s trying to convince her that it&rsquo;s a sign and that she&rsquo;s straight. Her mom also set her up on a date with this one guy who she doesn&rsquo;t really like. This guy stalked her to her house, went inside, and asked, &ldquo;So if you&rsquo;re lesbian, how are we supposed to have sex?&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lesbian too, I like girls!&ldquo; Yeah, that guy was on the bus with us to go to my friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;date&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know about you but I don&rsquo;t like people like him. Just no.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s almost ten and for some reason I&rsquo;m completely drained. I really need to get my sleeping schedule on track soon. Blergh.</p>

          <p><p>Wow, it&rsquo;s already August! I can&rsquo;t believe it. Summer is half way done. No way. I wish summer break was longer. I don&rsquo;t want to think about school yet. Although I&rsquo;m extremely excited to start shopping for school supplies. That&rsquo;s honestly my favourite part of going back to school. I&rsquo;m in love with stationary. Notebooks and binders are something I go through very quickly&hellip;</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. It looks like I haven&rsquo;t blogged in a while, but I have. A lot of my posts that I made within the past nine days are set to private. Why? Because they contain very personal content and I don&rsquo;t want to have a physical diary. For some reason, I have more motivation to do it on my blog than on paper. I&rsquo;ve been keeping diaries for a while and because of that my family members are more likely to find it. I&rsquo;m horrible at hiding the fact that I have a diary. There&rsquo;s absolutely no privacy in this house. Seeing that my parents are technologically illiterate, I am basically free to do whatever as long as my parents aren&rsquo;t watching over my shoulder. As for my brother, what I say on the Internet doesn&rsquo;t bother him as long as I don&rsquo;t bad mouth him (which I don&rsquo;t). So yeah, this blog is like a diary to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday I came home from camping for two days. For some reason, camping isn&rsquo;t that fun for me anymore. I miss the old days when my family, extended family, and family friends would always go camping as a big huge family. There hasn&rsquo;t been a gathering that big in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but I&rsquo;ve been thinking about family a lot. My family here in Canada and in the Philippines. A couple of days ago, I was Skyping with my cousin and my grandparents in the Philippines. I guess you can say I&rsquo;ve been under the weather since then because I really miss my family that lives in that part of the world. My parents want to visit since my grandmother&rsquo;s health is rapidly deteriorating but the trip will cost too much and with me going to university in a year, it just seems out of the question.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve never been filthy rich but we&rsquo;ve been comfortable. A couple of times we&rsquo;ve had some rough spots when it came to money but we managed to always get by. My parents have always stressed the importance of education because they never had the opportunity to continue theirs after high school. The Philippines is a third world country and my parents worked insanely hard to get here in Canada. Since my parents don&rsquo;t have a good education, they&rsquo;re stuck with part time jobs. On top of that, they&rsquo;re always sending money to their family in the Philippines and they&rsquo;ve been doing that for the past twenty years. They&rsquo;ve managed to sponsor some of my aunts, uncles, and cousins to come here to work in Canada to do the same. Yeah, my family is still definitely luckier than others but we still have problems.</p>

<p>I know my mom is worried about her own mother and I just feel guilty that my going to school could prevent her from seeing my grandmother one last time. For me, family would definitely come first before education but my mom also has her heart on me going next year. But money is a big issue.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just wish money was never an issue. Not with just my own problems but with the whole world. Money is just a source of problems but I guess that without money, our world would be in even more chaos than right now but that&rsquo;s an entirely different issue. The world is just unfair.</p>

<p>How I got into this topic, I don&rsquo;t even know. This blog post was all over the place but I feel a whole lot better after letting out some steam. Ah, the day in the life of a second generation immigrant.</p>

          <p><p>I have another week to go! I&rsquo;m just ready for it all to be over. Today was a good day because during my 15 minute break, I met up with one of my friends in the hallway. He and the school marching band been in the US for a while and just came back last night so I had a good talk with him. For a moment, I forgot I had school until the bell rang for the end of the break. Tomorrow after school, I&rsquo;m going to watch my school&rsquo;s marching band compete. Every year during Stampede, there&rsquo;s a marching band competition. I was in band last year and we won first place, so I hope they&rsquo;ll win again!</p>

</div>

<p>Speaking of Stampede (an annual 10 day festival/rodeo), a couple days ago, Prince William and Princess Kate came by and participated in our Stampede Parade. I didn&rsquo;t get to watch it but my brother did and he said the Prince William looked pretty mad, faking happiness, and/or bored throughout the whole thing. I can&rsquo;t say that I blame him. The man is probably tired of touring everywhere and just wants to go home.</p>

<p>Going on with the Stampede talk, although I&rsquo;m going to the Stampede tomorrow, I&rsquo;m only going to watch my friends compete. Going to the Stampede every year is expensive. You have to pay the entrance fee and then buy tickets for rides, games, and such. I&rsquo;m not much of a rider but I love watching various performances and acts. I also/mostly enjoy the food. Cotton candy, sweet and salty popcorn, and mini doughnuts is a must for every year. I can eat those things any other day of the year, but it&rsquo;s just not the same if it&rsquo;s not from the Stampede grounds. My stomach is happy just thinking about it.</p>
