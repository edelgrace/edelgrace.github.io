      <description>Okay, for two weeks I told myself that I would watch the Worlds for figure skating but now I have some time to watch some of it. In typical &amp;ldquo;me-fashion&amp;rdquo; these posts are purely for my own enjoyment (that is the philosophy of this blog anyway sp yes, I am extremely vain!). I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT FIGURE SKATING. I just enjoy watching it. Read on if you dare!

I heard from the grapevine that reading week started because mid-semester is a period when too stressed out students tend to commit suicide.</description>
