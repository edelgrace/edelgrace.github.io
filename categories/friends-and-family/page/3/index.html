          <p><p>Usually I bring a textbook with me on the train to study from but today I had only one lecture and I definitely forgot to bring one. So I decided it would be good to write a blog post for once because I really do miss writing these things.</p>

<p>Christmas is indeed in the air! Last week in the food court on campus, Christmas carols were playing and a Santa was walking around asking for donations for some charity. I&rsquo;m definitely in the holiday spirits!</p>

<p>My dad though is a Christmas fanatic. On the first of November, we put our Christmas tree up. Yeah. The <strong>first of November</strong>. The family was all home for once and my brother and I put up the decorations on the tree while mom sang Christmas songs and my dad took pictures of us. It was really festive but really way to early to do those things (I had fun either way).</p>

<p>Around two weeks ago he put up the Christmas lights. We got some really long Christmas lights from a family friend because they moved to a condo. My dad put the lights on top of the fence, around all the windows, and even on my little evergreen tree (&ldquo;little&rdquo; even though it&rsquo;s taller than me&hellip; And I&rsquo;m the older one!). As well, my dad plays the Christmas station all the time! I&rsquo;m serious. When he&rsquo;s driving, it&rsquo;s all he listens to. And whenever he&rsquo;s home and not sleeping, he&rsquo;s listening to it. In the morning he boosts up the volume until it&rsquo;s deafeningly loud to wake us up.</p>

<p>He also loves telling us about Christmas in the Philippines. When he was younger he&rsquo;d go caroling door to door for food. And then they&rsquo;d go play outside until midnight and light fireworks and firecrackers. It&rsquo;s really cute when my dad gets in the holiday spirit. It runs off on me too!</p>

<p>Even though I am feeling the holiday cheer, I am absolutely dreading the days as they pass by. Why?</p>

<p>Finals.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of season again! My first final is this Monday, and I&rsquo;m kind of terrified. Programming is pretty easy if you do all the labs and pay attention. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll at least pass that one. The other ones&hellip; I&rsquo;m not so sure! I&rsquo;m taking a course which is kind of like chemistry. I always just seem to let it slip amongst everything else. There&rsquo;s no mandatory homework except for labs and I never do any practice problems or anything. Mostly because I do have mandatory homework in the rest of my classes and I just don&rsquo;t bother about my chemistry-like course. It&rsquo;s really bad, I know. As much as I&rsquo;d like to study that and only that until the exam, I&rsquo;d probably fail the rest of my exams. Oh well, I&rsquo;ll just do what I can, I guess!</p>

          <h4>Jul 26, 2012 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/new-layout-and-some-other-things/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
          
          <div class="tags">

                <li><a href="/categories/friends-and-family">Friends and Family</a></li>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Yes, after a couple of months, I&rsquo;m somewhat back! And with a new layout as well. I rather like this one more than the previous one. They were both still extremely simple, but I&rsquo;m not a talented designer. I just like writing a lot (I think). With Brokenphrases, I wanted the layouts to be similar to each other. As in, using certain elements (in this case, the logo and the broken two-coloured circle) but with a different structure. I moved the sidebar over to the right (oooh, revolutionary) and removed the footer. There are still some kinks here and there, mostly in the pages and such.</p>

<p>This new layout is supposed to reflect a new change in Brokenphrases. You can see in the nav that there are three new links. Life, music, and books. &ldquo;Life&rdquo; is all of my posts about, well, my life. This will lead you back to Brokenphrases. However, &ldquo;music&rdquo; and &ldquo;books&rdquo; will direct you to my subdomains that are specific to those things. As well, I&rsquo;ve installed a plugin that will have posts from those subdomains showing up here on Brokenphrases. All this fancy talk is kind of confusing, so just go click on the link yourself.</p>

<p>On my subdomain blogs, they also have a new layout that is similar to Brokenphrases. I want to emphasize the link between all three blogs. Eventually I will link &ldquo;my photoblog&rdquo; (Tumblr =P) here to Brokenphrases as well. But I&rsquo;m not used to the Tumblr layouts so that will have to wait.</p>

<p>The main reason why I did this is because I realized I was posting more on my side blogs rather than on here, Brokenphrases. I&rsquo;ve been blogging here and there since April (still not as much as I would like to be though) but it has been happening. Then I realized that not everyone notices my other blogs, or even knows about it. Hence, the linking of my three blogs.</p>

<p>But the reality is, I probably still won&rsquo;t blog as much, despite these new developments. University is coming up, and lol, engineering. From now on, I&rsquo;m just going to post as much as I can. But yeah, that&rsquo;s my PSA of the day.</p>

<p>Currently, summer is decent. My dad leaves for the Philippines this Saturday for two weeks. My grandfather isn&rsquo;t doing so well. He was pretty sick last week, which is why my dad booked a flight. Just two days ago my grandfather was hospitalized. It sounds serious. My aunt (from my dad&rsquo;s side, obviously) and her kids yesterday came over. They&rsquo;re going to the Philippines as well and staying for around a year. My aunt tried Skyping some of my relatives but it didn&rsquo;t work. Since my aunt doesn&rsquo;t have the best financial situation, she had to use our phone to call the Philippines. It was kind of distressing to hear her try to talk to my grandfather. A lot of crying. I really can&rsquo;t take any crying. I hope my dad makes it in time. Minus the situation, I&rsquo;m quite jealous of my dad, actually. I miss the Philippines like heck right now and ugh.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I meant to post last on the 15th but I just couldn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I should blog. It just didn&rsquo;t feel right to do so. Even now, I&rsquo;m not so comfortable posting this but I just need to get it out, which is why it&rsquo;s private. Only three people have the password to my private posts so I guess it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>

<p>On the 15th I received a text from a friend asking about our mutual friend, T.</p>

<p>T&rsquo;s one of my closest guy friends whom I affectionly call Muffin. We went to the same junior high together and we both excelled at the extreme sport of procrastination. I told Muffin everything about life. I trusted him with all my secrets. However, within the past year I haven&rsquo;t really talked to him that much. We&rsquo;d see each other in the halls and say a quick &ldquo;Hi how are you?&rdquo; and go on to our classes. Sometimes there was a hug. Him ruffling my hair. Poking each others sides. The usual friendship shenanigans.</p>

<p>So my friend asked if I had talked to Muffin lately and to check his Facebook page. I said no and proceeded to look at his wall on Facebook. There was a single post that I saw right away. It was a RIP message from his sister. At first I couldn&rsquo;t really believe it. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s a practical joke or something.&rdquo; But as people started commenting and more wall posts began to appear, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t a joke. Somehow, I had a small shred of hope that maybe, just maybe, it was a joke after all.</p>

<p>Still, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep right away that night. I cried and prayed that this wasn&rsquo;t real. When I walked into the band room for practice this morning, I felt like throwing up. His sister, M, is in band and plays the flute, just like me. She&rsquo;s the sweetest girl I know and she&rsquo;s always smiling. So when I saw her crying, I was filled with dread. It wasn&rsquo;t a joke. T&rsquo;s really gone.</p>

<p>Me and my friend A didn&rsquo;t say anything but we went over and hugged her. I tried to keep myself from crying because it would just be selfish of me. It was so hard, especially when M started shaking in my arms as she sobbed. The only thought in my head was, &ldquo;T, why did you leave her behind, this sweet little girl who just loves you to death? What happened to make you leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, I didn&rsquo;t really know what happened exactly but I had a vague feeling. I still don&rsquo;t like to say it because it just makes me shiver all over.</p>

<p>First period comes and goes and then it&rsquo;s time for second period. While my teacher was explaining every single meaning of every single sentence and word and punctuation mark of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, another teacher walks in and gives her a sheet of paper. A troubled looked crossed over my teacher&rsquo;s face and she sighed. I clenched my jaw and buried my head into my book.</p>

<p>Half an hour passes and my principal&rsquo;s voice comes onto the intercom, &ldquo;Please excuse this interruption. Teachers please read out the handout you just received. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We learned that over the weekend that T.W. passed away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ground my teeth so that my mouth wouldn&rsquo;t wobble or let out a cry. It was official. Really official this time. I spent the rest of the period trying not to cry. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that Muffin was gone.</p>

<p>After that the week went well actually. I tried not to think about it during the day, and it worked. I said my prayers for him every night.</p>

<p>Friday was the funeral.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to a funeral so I was scared. I was bit late but I managed to see two of my friends who I stood next to the whole time. It was crowded. I kind of expected it. Muffin has a lot friends. He was just so outgoing and cheerful and kind that all kinds of people flocked to him. So we literally stood a few inches away from the entrance where tons of over people where standing as well for the whole time.</p>

<p>Muffin&rsquo;s friend, appropriately nicknamed Cupcake, made a speech. It was wonderful. So many memories flooded into my mind at the time. I giggled at some of the hilarious teenage shenanigans and cried at the parts when it seemed like Cupcake couldn&rsquo;t hold it together. But he did and I never felt so proud for him. This is cheesy, but I was filled with love for some reason.</p>

<p>As it came to a close, I had a sudden urge to see his face. One last time. But I was in the back and I couldn&rsquo;t make it to see him in time. Maybe it was better if I didn&rsquo;t. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have handled it.</p>

<p>When they brought out the coffin, all the emotions I held in that past week burst out of me. I sobbed into my friend&rsquo;s shoulder as I watched as his best friend since the age of seven carried the coffin into the hearse. As I watched as his father quietly sobbed in his arm as the other men held him. As I saw his sister turn her head away and cry out loud. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Was that really Muffin in that coffin? What was his expression? And as silly as this sounds, was it really him? I was filled with immense sorrow and anger at that moment. Anger at myself, anger at him, anger towards whatever had caused this&hellip; I still kind of am but now it&rsquo;s considerably less.</p>

<p>After the hearse drove away, I made me way to say my condolences. All I could say was &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while&rdquo; and I hugged Cupcake for the longest time. I suddenly realized how long it was since I talked to him and how long it was since I told anyone any of my secrets. Then I went to hug Muffin&rsquo;s sister. It was a quick one. I don&rsquo;t know her that well. She looked at me and with the bravest and strongest face I have ever seen she said, &ldquo;If you want anything of Tai&rsquo;s, let me know.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s another topic entirely.</p>

<p>I lingered around. Hugged. Cried. Said good byes. I left feeling better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit unsettled. The halls seem emptier. I miss him. But little by little, I&rsquo;m getting used to it. I&rsquo;m not sure about his family though, especially his sister. They must have it so hard. I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine it. For now, I&rsquo;m going to pray for him and his family. I hope he can hear my prayers.</p>

          <p><p>Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was&hellip; Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &ldquo;play all&rdquo; function so that was interesting. It&rsquo;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. I actually started writing blog posts that I intended to post for later.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s new with my life? Absolutely nothing. I&rsquo;m really getting my butt kicked in everything schoool related. Not literally. But that&rsquo;s not new, I&rsquo;m always getting my butt kicked! I just need to pick up the pace and spring break seems like the greatest oppurtunity to catch up and get on my study horse again.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my little to-do list for the break:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Study for a calculus test.</p></li>

<li><p>Trig review questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Physics homework from last week.</p></li>

<li><p>Activity guide on democracy.</p></li>

<li><p>130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start and finish reading <em>Heart of Darkness</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start reading <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah. I think there&rsquo;s more actually but the most daunting task is those questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I&rsquo;m currently avoiding it but sooner or later I have to do it. I guess looking at that list is motivation in itself. Also, I want to get this done and over with so I have the rest of the break to do whatever I want (sitting at the computer, watching TV, playing video games, and more, haha) instead of doing everything I want first and then staying up until 3 in the morning the day before I go back to school.</p>

<p>On another note, today is my mother&rsquo;s birthday today! She&rsquo;s 53 today. It&rsquo;s interesting how we (we as in teenagers, which I know doesn&rsquo;t apply to all of you out there) get so caught up in our own lives and our growing up but we don&rsquo;t really notice our parent(s)/guardian(s) growing older. Suddenly I notice the wrinkles, the knobby hands, the slightly bent back, and the strands of grey hair. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m starting to appreciate my mom a whole lot more. Happy birthday mom!</p>

          <p><p>Yesterday was my birthday. Yay birthdays! I&rsquo;m now the golden age of 17 (this means I have to change all my ages on my websites, ack)! I kinda don&rsquo;t feel any different (no one ever does, am I right?), not to mention that 17 is a weird number. I guess it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s odd. But 21 and 23 aren&rsquo;t that weird of numbers either. I guess 17 is weird because it&rsquo;s that age that&rsquo;s in between. I&rsquo;m a teen but almost a legal adult. Oh, that&rsquo;s a scary thought.</p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday was a great day! It&rsquo;s far from one of the best birthdays ever but it was still loads of fun.</p>

<p>In the morning we woke up extra early to go to the weekday mass as church. After mass Father made the congregation sing happy birthday to me. It was embarrassing. Like, what do you do other than stand there awkwardly with a ridiculous grin on your face while people sing to you? I sure don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>After that we went home for a bit and then headed out for the mall. I invited a couple of friends for lunch and a movie. We watched the new Sherlock Holmes movie. I wanted to watch The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo but it&rsquo;s 18A. One of my frieds is already 18 so she could have bought the tickets for us but I didn&rsquo;t want her to. Good thing though because Sherlock Holmes is a great movie! Oh goodness, I loved it so much. Maybe even more than the first one. It had just the right mix of action, comedy, and wonderful deductions. Although I would have liked Sherlock to deduce more as he spent more screen time punching people or shooting a gun. Still, his antics were just golden.</p>

<p>I went home after the movie and fell asleep on my brother as he played on his shiny new PS3 since I was tired. I drooled a bit, haha. Then I was rudely awoken by him when our first visitors rang the doorbell. As more people came we started to eat. It was yummy dinner. Classic Filipino dishes and spaghetti. Although the spaghetti was quite dry, but shh, don&rsquo;t tell my mom that.</p>

<p>Overall it was a great day. I still can&rsquo;t get over the movie though. It&rsquo;s like when I watched Inception. Yeah, Inception. Don&rsquo;t judge me, I love that movie.</p>
