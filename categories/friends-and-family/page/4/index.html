          <p><p>Wow, it&rsquo;s already August! I can&rsquo;t believe it. Summer is half way done. No way. I wish summer break was longer. I don&rsquo;t want to think about school yet. Although I&rsquo;m extremely excited to start shopping for school supplies. That&rsquo;s honestly my favourite part of going back to school. I&rsquo;m in love with stationary. Notebooks and binders are something I go through very quickly&hellip;</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. It looks like I haven&rsquo;t blogged in a while, but I have. A lot of my posts that I made within the past nine days are set to private. Why? Because they contain very personal content and I don&rsquo;t want to have a physical diary. For some reason, I have more motivation to do it on my blog than on paper. I&rsquo;ve been keeping diaries for a while and because of that my family members are more likely to find it. I&rsquo;m horrible at hiding the fact that I have a diary. There&rsquo;s absolutely no privacy in this house. Seeing that my parents are technologically illiterate, I am basically free to do whatever as long as my parents aren&rsquo;t watching over my shoulder. As for my brother, what I say on the Internet doesn&rsquo;t bother him as long as I don&rsquo;t bad mouth him (which I don&rsquo;t). So yeah, this blog is like a diary to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday I came home from camping for two days. For some reason, camping isn&rsquo;t that fun for me anymore. I miss the old days when my family, extended family, and family friends would always go camping as a big huge family. There hasn&rsquo;t been a gathering that big in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but I&rsquo;ve been thinking about family a lot. My family here in Canada and in the Philippines. A couple of days ago, I was Skyping with my cousin and my grandparents in the Philippines. I guess you can say I&rsquo;ve been under the weather since then because I really miss my family that lives in that part of the world. My parents want to visit since my grandmother&rsquo;s health is rapidly deteriorating but the trip will cost too much and with me going to university in a year, it just seems out of the question.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve never been filthy rich but we&rsquo;ve been comfortable. A couple of times we&rsquo;ve had some rough spots when it came to money but we managed to always get by. My parents have always stressed the importance of education because they never had the opportunity to continue theirs after high school. The Philippines is a third world country and my parents worked insanely hard to get here in Canada. Since my parents don&rsquo;t have a good education, they&rsquo;re stuck with part time jobs. On top of that, they&rsquo;re always sending money to their family in the Philippines and they&rsquo;ve been doing that for the past twenty years. They&rsquo;ve managed to sponsor some of my aunts, uncles, and cousins to come here to work in Canada to do the same. Yeah, my family is still definitely luckier than others but we still have problems.</p>

<p>I know my mom is worried about her own mother and I just feel guilty that my going to school could prevent her from seeing my grandmother one last time. For me, family would definitely come first before education but my mom also has her heart on me going next year. But money is a big issue.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just wish money was never an issue. Not with just my own problems but with the whole world. Money is just a source of problems but I guess that without money, our world would be in even more chaos than right now but that&rsquo;s an entirely different issue. The world is just unfair.</p>

<p>How I got into this topic, I don&rsquo;t even know. This blog post was all over the place but I feel a whole lot better after letting out some steam. Ah, the day in the life of a second generation immigrant.</p>

          <p><p>I have another week to go! I&rsquo;m just ready for it all to be over. Today was a good day because during my 15 minute break, I met up with one of my friends in the hallway. He and the school marching band been in the US for a while and just came back last night so I had a good talk with him. For a moment, I forgot I had school until the bell rang for the end of the break. Tomorrow after school, I&rsquo;m going to watch my school&rsquo;s marching band compete. Every year during Stampede, there&rsquo;s a marching band competition. I was in band last year and we won first place, so I hope they&rsquo;ll win again!</p>

<p>Speaking of Stampede (an annual 10 day festival/rodeo), a couple days ago, Prince William and Princess Kate came by and participated in our Stampede Parade. I didn&rsquo;t get to watch it but my brother did and he said the Prince William looked pretty mad, faking happiness, and/or bored throughout the whole thing. I can&rsquo;t say that I blame him. The man is probably tired of touring everywhere and just wants to go home.</p>

<p>Going on with the Stampede talk, although I&rsquo;m going to the Stampede tomorrow, I&rsquo;m only going to watch my friends compete. Going to the Stampede every year is expensive. You have to pay the entrance fee and then buy tickets for rides, games, and such. I&rsquo;m not much of a rider but I love watching various performances and acts. I also/mostly enjoy the food. Cotton candy, sweet and salty popcorn, and mini doughnuts is a must for every year. I can eat those things any other day of the year, but it&rsquo;s just not the same if it&rsquo;s not from the Stampede grounds. My stomach is happy just thinking about it.</p>

          </div>

          <p><p>Like the title says, happy Canada day! Today Prince William and Kate are in Canada as we speak celebrating with us. My family doesn&rsquo;t really do anything special for Canada day except for wearing red all day. Last year I spent Canada day in the States actually because of marching band. We were practicing on a football field and on the large scaffolding where the band directors stood, we hung a huge Canadian flag on it. Yeah, that was our Canada day celebration. Today, my family friend is holding a birthday party. That&rsquo;s the extent of our partying for this year.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention this last time I blogged but my favourite contestant on <em>Filipinas Got Talent</em> won! His name is Marcelito Po Moy and he&rsquo;s amazing. He can sing like a man and a woman. The first time I listened to him, I thought he was actually a girl even though he doesn&rsquo;t look like it. I really like it when he sings in his normal voice though.</p>

<p><img src="http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/1804/happyfeetplacedsecondin.jpg" alt="Happy Feet" style="float:right;" /></p>

<p>However, the contestants that got second place really did capture my heart as well. They&rsquo;re a two man act called Happy Feet. It consists of two brothers, one 12 (Laudito) and the other 21 (Ramonito), and they did tap dancing. At first they were voted out but they were voted back in again with an overwhelming amount of votes. Then they landed in second place with 18.22% votes (Marcelito had 19.36%).</p>

<p>I think their story really resonated with the viewers. You see, the Philippines is a third world country and most people have it hard. I don&rsquo;t know the full story of Happy Feet but they have it hard too. They come from a poor family. The two brothers had to sell tomatoes and eat only bread everyday to finance their trip to the auditions. During the auditions, the brothers revealed that they weren&rsquo;t wearing real tap dancing shoes since they couldn&rsquo;t afford it, but rather leather shoes they made. Actually, they had no idea that the dance they loved so much was called tap dancing before the show. They always referred it to &ldquo;happy feet dancing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At the end of their journey, when the grand winners were finally announced, one of the judges exclaimed that she would buy a loaf of bread for every member of their family (she&rsquo;s also been reported to have bought the boys tap dancing shoes right after their audition). Although Happy Feet&rsquo;s talent wasn&rsquo;t as explosive and awe inspiring as Marcelito&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no doubt that they are shining example of genuine family love and perseverance.</p>

          <p><p>Today was pretty fun!! I found out that I lost 13 pounds, that I fail at trying to bench press, and that I can jump! And a lot of band things happened today.</p>

<p>So today was Marina&rsquo;s (colour guard and clarinet) 16th birthday! And Andrew Lumapas came!! He&rsquo;s for sure my hero. His YouTube vids are EPICALLY AMAZING. So amazing that I have to use all caps. Go check out  <a href="http://youtube.com/omnomnomandrew">his YouTube account</a>.</p>

<p>Then during math I got 500 texts (I&rsquo;m exagerating, obviously) texts saying that we had to come back to school at 7 to perform for the grade nine open house.</p>

<p>After school, band people started coming and the band instructors started playing a slideshow they showed for Post Party. It was hilarious looking and the pictures of the alumini band pictures. And cute because even some of the couples now, are still together (some, anyway). Plus we watched the Italy show! I think it was from 2007 or 2008 and called Quest or something. It was good, but nowhere as good as this year!</p>

<p>OMG. I met a guy, Corey, who I first met online through my grade nine friend Tai. He&rsquo;s soo cute but only a kid way. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll like my school for sure!</p>

<p>When we played for the grade nines, we kinda epically failed cause there was NO seniors but we still sounded good. I for sure hope we convinced sone grade nines to join band.</p>

<p>After we played some of our parade tunes me and my friend wandered off places. We ran into Tai and Corey a couple of times (they thought we were stalking them but we were circling the school while they stood in one place. Kinda hard to miss them).</p>

<p>So yeah, tonight was eventful. Lots of hanging out time. It&rsquo;s so good to see potential bandies.</p>

<p>To focus on my offline life&hellip; I just spent four hours at my friend&rsquo;s house. Yummy chips, walks to fish creek park, picture taking, and girl talks.</p>

<p>I have to make sure my band teachers convince my mom about me going to California for our tour this summer. My mom won&rsquo;t let me go because it&rsquo;s too expensive ($2000) and because she &ldquo;can&rsquo;t stand it if I left her for ten days.&rdquo; The money issue I can understand, but not the second issue. Really? I growing up, you have to let me go some places.</p>
