          <p><p><strong>Warning: Implied misogynistic content, alluding to the USBC shootings, and mentions of rape.</strong></p>

<p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I&rsquo;ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was listening to an episode of the Internet Box, which was recorded around the time when Andrew got a Tumblr and started stirring the pot with the social justice fan community. Dylon was trying to steer away the conversation from using ableism terms and Barbara told Dylon that he has &ldquo;So much to learn about the world.&rdquo; That made me legitimately angry and sad because I really love Barbara but no, Barbara there a couple of things you have a lot to learn too. I wish I could be that blissfully and purposefully ignorant of all the things that my friends and I do that are harmful. In the famous words of Burnie Burns, &ldquo;God dammit Barbara.&rdquo;</li>
<li>My prof asked who was going to watch Maleficent and then he asked if anyone was going to see it because of Angelina Jolie and I think I was the only one who put up their hand??? In a history of video games class filled with mostly males I am confused but also slightly pleased.</li>

<li><p>&ldquo;College is a time when everyone experiences things such as sex, and fun, and pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Idk, I hate how there are people who think this a guaranteed and mandatory and expected &ldquo;college experience.&rdquo; I mean I know &ldquo;fun&rdquo; is objective but I’m pretty sure in this context it means &ldquo;partying&rdquo; and &ldquo;clubbing&rdquo; but college isn’t just that, there are other ways of having fun too.</p>

<p>And god, this guy is just so… So full of it. This video makes me sick to my stomach. We don’t owe people our affections and we don’t &ldquo;deny&rdquo; anyone to a happy life. Wow I’m having a hard time of sympathizing with this guy (which I&rsquo;m not trying to do but he&rsquo;s trying to get us to do). He takes the friendzone to the extreme I can’t wrap my head around how there are people who actually think this way. It just sickens me that people died over this. this is not ok.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay this one is too long to put under a bullet point.</p>

<p>I honestly love Nintendo because they’ve been doing their own thing ever since they got into the video industry. Before no one really cared about bugs in their games but then Nintendo came along and demanded all of their programmers to go through rigorous testing. They controlled what games could or could not be released on their platform (preventing things like <em>Custer&rsquo;s Revenge</em> which was basically a rape simulator for the Atari 2600 made by a porn company). Because of this (and their good games of course) they single-handedly revived the video game industry in the 70s/80s (my prof would be disappointed reading this).</p>

<p>It kinda makes me sad to see them going on a downhill but they are honestly stuck in the old times and very much set in their traditional values and people thought it was unthinkable then, but it’s even more unthinkable now. Although you gotta hand it to them for sticking to their guns. Now I totally get why nintendo does the backward things they do.</p>

<p>And yeah this rant came about because I was totally listening to The Patch. Every week they talk about something that I’m learning in class. Last week they were talking about arcade games and this week they’re talking about Nintendo. I love hearing current &ldquo;news&rdquo; about the things I’m learning it makes things that much more interesting.</p>

<p>TL;DR I&rsquo;m not so surprised about nintendo’s “backwardness” anymore when that’s what they’ve been for the entirety of their existence and once (maybe more than once idk yet??) it actually worked out for them.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Mass Effect 4 I just want to talk more. I want to learn more about their cultures and I want to do stuff for them, even if it’s just talking them through decisions and not going to the ends of the universe for them. Like how that one “couple” on the citadel were debating whether or not they wanted to undergo gene therapy for the unborn child. I also want to eavesdrop on conversations. I want to hear mundane stuff like &ldquo;Did you hear about X in accounting? he’s getting MARRIED.&rdquo; I want to hear game relevant stuff like &ldquo;I heard that if you go to this planet, you can get Y model of armor&rdquo; or &ldquo;There’s a rumour that Z is hiding in the W solar system.&rdquo; There are a lot of other things i want in ME4 but like adsjkfhkasdj. I hope ME4 will be amazing, Bioware please don’t let me doooooown.</li>
<li>Did I ever mention that I was watching one of Ray’s livestreams and I said something in the chat and Ray mentioned my name AND HE SAID IT RIGHT and it just made me so happy to hear my name in his voice like I can almost die happy now I just need a hug from him.</li>
<li>I took an ethics course and our prof was so hard on us when it came to the topic of eating meat. Every single argument we could come up with FOR eating meat, he tore them apart and exposed every single flaw in them. Then he gave his arguments AGAINST eating meat and they were so convincing and almost untouchable. I just CANNOT justify eating meat anymore but I still do it anyway. I just feel extremely guilty whenever I eat meat now.</li>
<li>when I was in elementary school I tried to make an Alyson Stoner guild on Neopets except I couldn’t say &ldquo;Alyson Stoner&rdquo; in the description because it kept censoring me telling me I couldn’t use that word and at that point I was innocent enough to not know why her name was a bad word.</li>
<li>Sometimes I wish there were &ldquo;readme for newbies&rdquo; version for 99% of the readme files on github because I’m really not that great at reading documentation and most of them assume that I already know something but I don’t and I never know what it is that I should know because I don’t know it in the first place???</li>

<p>This was my second year going to my local con. Last year I went all three days but this year I just went one day. It was a lot of fun but also soooo exhausting!</p>

<p>It was typical weather for my city: snowing. Ugh. Gross. I got there earlier than I wanted, so I had to wait in line. In the snow. Thankfully, I wasn&rsquo;t waiting for too long! The line was so much faster than last year. Instead of walking around the building to the front entrance, they just let us in through the back doors. Less time waiting outside and less time spent walking outside is fine with me. The line itself was also a lot more organized. They split up the line into more lines instead of making arbitrary groups as the line moved. It was a lot more faster that way. Thank goodness!</p>

<!--more Read the rest of my con shenanigans!-->

<p>I went with two friends of mine and their friends. It was a lot of fun! My friend, P, dressed up as Petra from the anime <em>Shingeki no Kyojin</em>. She was the only one who cosplayed. She didn&rsquo;t get a lot of people asking for pictures and she actually enjoyed it that way. I think it&rsquo;s because not a lot of people who go to the con don&rsquo;t pay much attention to anime. But she looked super cool anyway!</p>

<p>We parted ways soon after, and Petra and I went (semi-window) shopping! For two hours. I mostly did the shopping, haha. But I also took a lot of pictures. There were a lot of awesome cosplays, and ahhh. They were all really awesome.</p>

        Another Commander Shepard cosplayer. I had to chase down this guy and I called after him saying, "Exuse me, Commander Shepard!" and I felt a little bit like Emily Wong (a journalist in the game). It was surreal. Also it took forever for me to focus the camera and I giggled out of awkwardness (I should have explained myself, I hope he didn't think I was laughing at him...). That poor guy had to stand there for like a minute. Whoops.

        Halo dudes from Halo. I don't play this game (PlayStation all the way), but I love any cosplay with armor. I also love this picture because the dude on the left is looking forward and it's like the dude on the right is just like "Bro, what are you looking at?"

        A Pyscho enemy character from Borderlands. This guy was cool. His eyes were glowing and everything. I think I saw him last year too, and maybe at Otafest at well. But dang, that detail. He looks like he basically stepped out of the game!

<p>In the middle of the day, a friend and I went to get a photo op with the lovely Jessica Nigri, a cosplayer and Internet celebrity. She also does a voice in the RWBY animated series. She was super cute and super pretty! We got to get her to sign our photo with her, and her agent didn&rsquo;t let us pay for it. What an awesome dude. He was as upbeat and cool as she was! Probably one of the highlights of my day.</p>

<p>Also, in the picture, you can see that I&rsquo;m all buddy buddy with Nigri but my friend is really far away from her. It&rsquo;s now a running joke that he and her are&hellip; Close. Haha.</p>

<p>After that, we wandered and shopped a little bit more. We ended the day with attempting to get into a panel but it was really packed so we didn&rsquo;t get in. Which was okay with me because I was about ready to pass out! And so we parted ways and went home.</p>

<p>Onto the merchandise&hellip; I spent exactly $100 dollars, including food and not including transit and coat check. My brother asked me to buy something Rooster Teeth (not happening as they are the only ones who sell their stuff and they&rsquo;re based in Texas so&hellip; Yeah&hellip;) or League of Legends. The only LoL thing I found was really basic messenger bags and they were like $40. Sorry brother, you aren&rsquo;t getting that&hellip; But I did end up buying him a Grunt POP! figure. My brother looooves the Krogans from Mass Effect and the Grunt figure was so adorable that I knew he&rsquo;d love it! When we opened up the box, my brother immediately when &ldquo;Aweeh, he&rsquo;s so cute.&rdquo; The figures are so tiny, he fit in my freakishly small hand! So. Cute. I really wanted to find a Garrus figure but was unable to do so. I think they&rsquo;re really popular because the Garrus figure is even cuter than the Grunt one, and because Garrus is like THE most loved character in Mass Effect.</p>

<p>I also bought some Homestuck merchandise. I debated getting a Scalemate plushie, but opted for the art instead. The calendar has been on my wish list ever since it came out. While I wasn&rsquo;t particularly found of the tarot cards, it was such a deal to get them. I don&rsquo;t regret it at all. I have a love for &ldquo;predicting&rdquo; things (I don&rsquo;t take it too seriously though) and with the gorgeous art and the cards, I think I&rsquo;ll have a lot of fun with them. I also kinda feel like Cardcaptor Sakura. I need to buy those (Clow Cards) next&hellip;</p>

<p>Lastly, there were a lot of cosplays that I wasn&rsquo;t able to take pictures of or didn&rsquo;t see. A moment of silence for these amazing cosplays: Sakura from Cardcaptor Sakura, Satsuki and Ryuko from Kill La Kill, my friend cosplaying Blake from RWBY, Ruby and Weiss from RWBY, dude wearing a &ldquo;People Like Grapes&rdquo; shirt, girl wearing a &ldquo;Free Edgar 2014&rdquo; sign, Kaworu and Shinji from Evangelion, countless Connors and Ezios and Edwards from Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, and Trickster Jane from Homestuck. I&rsquo;m sure there are more but I just can&rsquo;t think of them at the moment. I also wanted to meet Westy from the Mikecast but it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to randomly bump into a specific person who is not cosplaying.</p>

<p>I saw cool people and I bought cool things. Overall, it was a pretty rad day.</p>

          <p><p>My exams ended relatively early last semester. That meant more time for a break! I didn&rsquo;t do terribly a lot over through break though. Definitely was not as productive as I would have liked to be.</p>

<p><strong>Finished watching and reading Shingeki no Kyojin</strong></p>

<p>Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime. The Internet has been basically exploding over it (my part of the Internet anyway). My friends in real life also freak out over it and so much so that I just had to see what they were on about. I definitely watched the last 13 episodes all in one sitting. It&rsquo;s a really awesome anime. The world and plot is cleverly crafted. Oh, you don&rsquo;t even know how clever the plot is!</p>

<p>I also finished reading the manga, starting from the very beginning. It was <em>really</em> good. The manga is ahead of the anime and if you thought the anime was clever&hellip; Just you wait until you catch up with the manga. I guess the good thing is that the anime is really close to the manga.</p>

<p><strong>Set up my Filofaxes</strong></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what a <a href="http://filofax.co.uk">Filofax</a> is, it&rsquo;s a company that makes binders that hold planner pages. They come in several sizes, colours, materials, and designs. They&rsquo;re also a bit expensive&hellip; I bought three and am currently using two. One is wallet and one is my day planner. I took a couple of days to personalize both. They&rsquo;re not 100% done but I like them the way they are right now.</p>

<p><strong>Turned 19</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, I turned 19. Big whoop. I&rsquo;m getting older. Upside is that I&rsquo;m the youngest out of my group of friends. I won&rsquo;t feel too old once everyone starts turning <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> this year. ;) But yeah I had a nice little get together with high school friends. All of my exclusively university only friends are from out of town and were away for the break which was understandable. It&rsquo;s so good to see my high school friends though. I really have to keep in touch with everyone haha.</p>

<p><strong>Played a lot</strong></p>

<p>My brother bought Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 4: Black Flag and my friend lent me all of the Metal Gear Solid games. I mostly played Assassin&rsquo;s Creed over the break. It was good but not as good as I hoped it would be. Eventually I&rsquo;d like to post on that as well.</p>

<p><strong>Did nothing</strong></p>

<p>Those were my biggest accomplishments for the winter break. Not entirely world changing but the goal was to relax, which I did! I wish I worked on my websites even a little bit but I opted for working on my Filofaxes instead. I just might have to dedicate a section in Ainsley<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-429" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-429">1</a></sup> to projects like those. Don&rsquo;t worry, I put it in my planner to-do list.</p>

          <p><p>And all though the house</p>

<p>Not a creature was stirring</p>

<p>Not even a certain university student who should be cramming.</p>

<p>Today was everything but studying. I had the intentions of doing so. I even planned out my day! Then things happened. Those things consist of: music and Ray. I spent most of my day hanging out on <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>. Then I went to make a quick tweet about how much I hate recursion, for when I actually decided to crack open my textbook for two seconds. Then I did a quick scan through of my Twitter timeline and saw that Ray was doing a live stream of Dead Rising 3 on Twitch.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know who Ray is, he is an employee of Rooster Teeth. He literally plays games (I lied, he mostly edits the footage of said gameplay) for a living and he is quite the comical guy. I got a shout out and was seriously happy he pronounced my username right (it has my actual name in it and people usually never get it right). It definitely made my heart go doki doki. Like, &ldquo;OMG he said my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On to the actual stream&hellip; I&rsquo;m not a big fan of zombie games. I watched my brother play the zombies mode in CoD and I grew tired of it within a week. Not to mention I&rsquo;ve watched the movie &ldquo;I Am Legend&rdquo; too many times before. I know &ldquo;Dead Rising&rdquo; and &ldquo;Last of Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Walking Dead&rdquo; are all hit video games but I will never get into the zombie craze. I really want to play Last of Us though, but I just don&rsquo;t want to do the zombie part of it. That&rsquo;s like everything. I don&rsquo;t even want to watch walkthroughs on YouTube. What is the world coming to??</p>
