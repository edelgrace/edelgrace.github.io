          <p><p>I understand that it is almost Thanksgiving in the States so others have long weekends as well. But our reasons for the long weekend are because of parent teacher interviews tomorrow and Rememberance day the after.</p>

<p>Speaking of Rememberance day, today was the Rememberance celebration at my school. Since I go to a Catholic school, the celebration is held at the church behind the school. It&rsquo;s a short walk across the field and into the parking lot but it was chilly. There was snow on the ground but not really, so that&rsquo;s always a plus.</p>

<p>The actual celebration was decent. The drama kids put on a homily/mini play. It&rsquo;s really cheesy, especially with Rememberance day. A lot of guns and dying. But my one friend, who has a very exuberant personality was narrating half of it and she did a wonderful job. She made me tear up!</p>

<p>Also, I always feel some sort of emotion when they do the role call of those who died in war. Seeing all those people stand up and pin a poppy onto the cross when someone they know is called is somehow heartbreaking. Yeah, that was my highlight of my day.</p>

<p>I got 93% on my math midterm! It was so easy, and I&rsquo;m just so happy right now. Omg. But. Physics always ruin my day. However, we&rsquo;re learning about centripical force and my teacher did a demo with a bucket full of water and swung it around with a string. It didn&rsquo;t spill (well duh) but the string broke the the bucket went flying. Chemistry was blah because we wrote a quiz on ice tables and I blanked. We also had a substitute so it was just a work period. On the bus, me and marie talked about jobs and scholarship. Quite exciting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that is it for today. Goodnight!</p>

          <p><p>Yesterday was Thanksgiving in Canada land. I wasn&rsquo;t able to post because of our super long but extremely satisfying dinner. Turkey, ham, and pasta for all! Not to mention that there was no school yesterday.</p>

<p>I said I was going to create passwords and give them out but that never really happened. It will happen <strike>sometime this week</strike> when I get around to it.</p>

<p>Today was rather interesting. Everyone was talking about post post. In our marching band, there&rsquo;s a tradition of having a post party. The party consists of all the band kids from the previous year. It&rsquo;s like a reunion. I wasn&rsquo;t able to go because I wasn&rsquo;t in band last year (I won&rsquo;t be able to go next year either because I&rsquo;m not in marching band this year).</p>

<p>The actual post party is pretty fun. I went to post last year. You dress up a fancy, have a big dinner with food brought in by everyone, watch last year&rsquo;s performance, and give out awards (sexiest music section, mr and mrs tan lines, biggest should be couple, etc), all in the band room.</p>

<p>But post post is what most people look forward to. It&rsquo;s post free post. The post party after the post party. That&rsquo;s where all the good stuff is (or so I&rsquo;ve heard). I&rsquo;ve never been to post post. Basically, you get drunk or stay sober and watch drunk people do stupid things, or watch other sober people get stupid things done to them.</p>

<p>Now because I believe in obeying the law (the band members are all grade elevens, twelves, first year university students, or right out of high school workers AKA mostly underaged kids), I never went to post post last year. Plus the appeal of getting drunk for the sake of getting drunk is nonexistent. Okay, some drunk people do funny things, but it&rsquo;s not that great when people start throwing up everywhere.</p>

<p>Today everyone was talking about post post and all the hilarious things and I just felt like face palming (although some of the stories were amusing). I was also feeling a bit left out but that&rsquo;s really besides the point. I don&rsquo;t tolerate stupidity very well from most people. Especially my friends. Ack, what can you do? I&rsquo;m like the only senior band geek who has not been drunk in her whole entire life yet. I enjoy being able to truthfully say that.</p>

<p>But more about today. There was no band practice this morning, so I slept in. When I got to school, I walked into the band room to be greeted by the grade ten woodwinds playing Christmas songs. Normally, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind listening to Christmas songs even before Halloween is over but the grades tens were just butchering it. My ears are not used to such musical profanity.</p>

<p>In math, we got our quizzes back. I got one question wrong and it&rsquo;s because I forgot to convert radians to degrees. I hate making silly mistakes like that because it&rsquo;s just like, I could have easily gotten a hundred! My mat teacher also makes you feel stupid when you make mistakes like that, so it didn&rsquo;t help me feel any better. But my math teacher was making more jokes than usual today. Maybe he was happy from the Thanksgiving dinner. I quite enjoy my math teacher actually.</p>

<p>Physics was bad. We had to convert graphs into another type of graph. It was so easy but my teacher takes half a class for us to work on things that should only take ten minutes. And then he says &ldquo;Oh you have a unit test next week&rdquo; when we&rsquo;ve barely learned anything. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to pass this course.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have my favorite subject! Chemistry. Chemistry was fun but not. We went over our quizzes, which I got 75% on. Blergh. I do not do well with oxidation numbers. However after we did that, we did a lab. A titration lab! I love titration labs. Especially watching the solutions change into one color and then quickly fade away multiple times. It&rsquo;s just like, &ldquo;Is it going to say pink? Yes? Yes? Oh, just kidding.&rdquo; I love chem labs.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was my day. I only had math homework so it was a pretty slack day. I enjoy and fully cherish this semester.</p>

          <p><p>I love the song September by Earth Wind and Fire, so I just couldn&rsquo;t help myself. On the 21st I sang the song throughout the whole day. I was tempted to go and play the song on my flute because I learned it, but I forgot where the music for the song went. Oh well. So, do you guys remember what happened on the 21st night of September?</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been contemplating this for a while. I really don&rsquo;t want some of my blog entries read by some of the people I know in real life as some of my friends know about my various sites, including this one. I keep a lot of private entries because of this. I actually post regularly, but they&rsquo;re all private. So I&rsquo;m thinking of making password protected entries. If you guys want a password to my entries, feel free to comment in this entry.</p>

<p>So what has been happening lately? School. Nothing new actually. I&rsquo;m trying to do as well as I can so that means that I have less of a social life but I never really had one anyway so that&rsquo;s a-okay!</p>

<p>I love all my classes. Except for my physics class. Most of my physics class includes grade elevens. A whole lot of them are immature. They&rsquo;re all loud and they take advantage of our really frail and old teacher. Our teacher isn&rsquo;t that great either. I don&rsquo;t really understand anything he says and when I ask him a question he just gets mad at me. Ack. I think our class just puts him in a bad mood. It puts me in a bad mood too. I kinda wish my teacher would yell at them or something. However, I don&rsquo;t think that would change anything anyway.</p>

<p>Well, I have to go as it&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s birthday today. Please wish him many birthdays to come. :]</p>

          <p><p>So I have vowed to write at least something everyday for this school year to document my final year in high school. Some of it will be published, some not. I also know most people don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;this is what I did this whole entire day&rdquo; kind of posts but it is my blog, and well, I&rsquo;ll blog whatever I want. :]</p>

<p>To start things off, today was rather ordinary. I woke up painfully early at six in the morning (well, it&rsquo;s early if you&rsquo;ve been sleeping in until noon for two months) because I heard my mom cooking. After an hour of trying to go back to sleep, my brother comes in to give me a kiss since he leaves earlier than me. That just woke me up even more.</p>

<p>So I stayed in bed for another two hours and finally started to get ready. I can still smell the wonderful scent of bacon right now. Anyway, getting ready was rather quick. I spent the next two hours playing around on the computer and then headed out to school.</p>

<p>The school wasn&rsquo;t empty but it was mostly grade elevens. The grade twelves didn&rsquo;t have to come for another hour so I was pretty early. I don&rsquo;t know many grade elevens so all I did was walk around the school until I found people I knew. Of course, they were in the band room.</p>

<p>After mingling and giving out hugs it was finally to go to our teacher advisor. I had a new one because my former teacher advisor retired. I&rsquo;m glad he did because he was grumpy and short tempered all the time. My new teacher advisor was young and very friendly. I like her. A very big change from my former one.</p>

<p>Then it was picture time. I waited for like twenty minutes to get my picture taken in the gym. I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether or not we were supposed to return to class after the picture because all my friends were waiting for me outside the gym. They all told me that their TAs said that they could leave right after their pictures so I was like okaaaay, I&rsquo;m trusting you guys and I&rsquo;m going to leave with you.</p>

<p>The bus ride home was awkward though. One of my friends is homosexual. Her former girlfriend just recently broke up with her and now her mom&rsquo;s trying to convince her that it&rsquo;s a sign and that she&rsquo;s straight. Her mom also set her up on a date with this one guy who she doesn&rsquo;t really like. This guy stalked her to her house, went inside, and asked, &ldquo;So if you&rsquo;re lesbian, how are we supposed to have sex?&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lesbian too, I like girls!&ldquo; Yeah, that guy was on the bus with us to go to my friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;date&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know about you but I don&rsquo;t like people like him. Just no.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s almost ten and for some reason I&rsquo;m completely drained. I really need to get my sleeping schedule on track soon. Blergh.</p>

<p>Over a week ago I went to the Stampede grounds to see Showbands Live. Showbands Live is an annual marching band competition. Every year there are the regulars (The Stetsons Calgary Showband, The Red Deer Royals, and Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts). Last year I was part of the Ghosts and I wanted to support them and see them compete. This year there were a lot of American bands that were participating. There are no words to describe how amazing each band was.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of all the acts that preformed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chinook Country Line Dancers</li>
<li>A Band of Outriders</li>
<li>The Red Deer Royals</li>
<li>The Renegade Regiment (US)</li>
<li>Calgary Stampede Showband</li>
<li>Lighthouse Brigade of Recine (US)</li>
<li>Calgary Stetsons Showband</li>
<li>Sound of Sun Prairie (US)</li>
<li>Shadow Armada (US)</li>
<li>Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/8065/76386837.png" alt="Stetsons" style="float:right;width:50%;height:50%;padding:5px;" /></p>

<p>All the bands were great but a few of them really stuck out to me. First things first, The Stetsons. The Stetsons is our rival band. For some reason, we don&rsquo;t like each other and it&rsquo;s been that way for a long time. Their show was pretty&hellip; decent. However, it bore a ton of similarities to Grandin&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s show. It was pretty obvious that they took some inspiration from our show, even copying some charts and formations. Even the concept of the show was the same. Other than that, it was a decent show. I think it relied to heavily on props but the music was pretty good.</p>

<p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s The Shadow Armada. They were from the US, a high school marching band. I must say that they were extremely impressive. Their show was extremely precise, the music was amazing, and the visuals just wow. I really loved their drumline. I have a soft spot for good drumlines even though I play a woodwind instrument. The drum solos were intricate and just so darn catchy. The Shadow Armada was a great marching band and really a great treat to watch. So great that they won first place. They really deserved as they were just that amazing.</p>

<p><img src="http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3755/71936535.png" alt="Grandin Ghosts" style="float:left;width:50%;height:50%;padding:5px;" /></p>

<p>Of course, I have to mention my own band, the Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts. After listening to them play their show music every day of the week before school, I have to say that they really improved from the beginning of the year. Their music was just amazing and so epic, and loud, and in your face. The show wasn&rsquo;t up to par with the early morning practices unfortunately. Still, their show was pretty good. Better than the Stetsons of course. Their theme was &ldquo;Pandora&rsquo;s Box&rdquo;. It was pretty cool because they had an actual box. It was glowing and spouting fog and everything. I have to say it was cool to see a prop like that. Sadly, they only landed third place but their competitors were tough. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m so proud of them!</p>

<p>Speaking of Grandin, I finished summer school two days ago. I finished the course with a 95% and a 98% on my final exam. Wow, I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s over. Now I can sleep in, stay up late, and blog as much as I want, haha.</p>
