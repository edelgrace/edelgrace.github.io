              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I&rsquo;ve been with <a href="http://three-words.net">Three Words Hosting</a> for a long time now. I can&rsquo;t exactly pinpoint how long&hellip; But I still had my first domain while I was with them. I remember when I had to jump from host to host because they kept disappearing. However, when I found Three Words, I felt like I could stay there forever. Honestly, I have nothing but praise for Misaki. She&rsquo;s been an outstanding host. What little downtime there is, it&rsquo;s not intrusive. She sends out timely e-mails and tweets whenever there are changes. Her passion for webhosting definitely shows.</p>

<p>Initially, I was being hosted for free. When the packages changed and free hosting was no longer being offered, I decided to change to paid shared hosting. The main reason is because I wanted to be able to contribute for the increasing server costs. The quality of hosting was so great that it would have been a crime to not pay for it, I felt.</p>

<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t work last summer because I was out of the country. Our trip sucked a lot from my savings. I&rsquo;m promised to get some of them repaid from my mom but it&rsquo;ll take a while before that happens. Combine that with the worsening Canadian dollar (I&rsquo;d give anything to have the loonie be worth more than the American dollar again), I looked at my bank account worringly. As soon as I do get a job again, I&rsquo;m highly considering going back to Three Words. Their packages ARE affordable, let me be clear, but not for a compulsive buyer (I blame Steam sales) with no income (like me).</p>

<p>For a while, I scoured the Internet for free hosts or absurdedly cheap hosts. Most of the free hosts did not fit with my space constraints. I wanted at least 2GB of space because 1GB is just too little. Backups can sometimes suck up the space. While I did find amazing packages for less than $5 a year, I was wary. A lot of these websites were new, amateur, or seemingly inactive websites. I didn&rsquo;t want to fall for another &ldquo;fly-by&rdquo; host who just takes my money.</p>

<p>Eventually, I settled for <a href="http://networkpanda.com">Network Panda</a>. I was browsing a forum and saw that they were having a promotion for lifetime $0.99/month packages. I jumped on the chance. From what I found about them, they&rsquo;re pretty well established. The packages themselves were great too. There were some mixed reviews but they were mostly positive. I decided to take the risk.</p>

<p>The payment was smooth and painless. I submitted a ticket for transferring my cPanel backup and received a reply in what seemed like within seconds. The whole process took around less than 10 minutes to have my websites restored to their former state.</p>

<p>So far, so good.</p>

<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve only been here for a couple of days but only time will tell how good Network Panda really is. If things start to go downhill, I won&rsquo;t hesitate to go back to Three Words or find a new host.</p>

<p>So, goodbye (hopefully for now) Three Words. Hello Network Panda!</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m kinda disappointed there are no pandas on the website, like&hellip; Where&rsquo;s your mascot, it&rsquo;s in your company name?!?!</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Okay I&rsquo;m so angry, I wrote this entire post out in the &ldquo;Quick Draft&rdquo; section of my dashboard, clicked &ldquo;Save Draft&rdquo; and then when I came back, what I wrote was erased. :( This happens a lot but not enough for me to remember to save entries locally before I publish&hellip; I&rsquo;ll try my best to recreate what I just wrote. I&rsquo;m still really salty, haha.</p>

<p>In my <a href="/2015/08/tumblr-post-5">previous post</a>, I mentioned that I was moving from <a href="http://getboostrap.com">Bootstrap</a> to <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a>. I even applied the theme to my <a href="http://study.erzadel.net/blog">study blog</a>. I don&rsquo;t really know where I got the motivation to finally do this. Maybe it&rsquo;s because school is approaching way to quickly and I wanted to do something productive for once. Over the summer I&rsquo;ve been planning all the projects that I want to accomplish with my websites. It&rsquo;s great to do even one thing on that list!</p>

<p>When it comes to my websites, I always get hung up when I (feel like I) have to update with a new theme. Foundation kind of alleviated that feeling. It&rsquo;s a super intuitive framework and easier (in my opinion) to work with than Bootstrap. Some time ago I accepted that I&rsquo;m not really that much of a web designer. So now I opt for more simple designs. Even though I&rsquo;ve been making websites for a couple of years now, I haven&rsquo;t really improved much when it comes to web design. I just really want to focus on making original content instead of agonizing over how to display that content. Premade themes are more accesible but I feel obligated to make it myself. If it means taking the &ldquo;easier&rdquo; route by using frameworks, so be it.</p>

<p>I have to admit, most of the content I want to make is very &ldquo;me&rdquo; oriented. I mostly only care about archiving the things I do so that I can look back on them. Honestly, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that much to me if I have a regular audience. While I genuinely like getting to know people who interact with my content, but it&rsquo;s not the main goal. &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; social media, though, is another beast entirely.</p>

<p>Social media is known for instant gratification and love how fast and simple feedback is. Most of the time, the feedback I get isn&rsquo;t even for my own content. There&rsquo;s something so easy about social media and I can put in a lot of time into it. I&rsquo;ve been trying to cut down but recently I logged back into my Tumblr account. However, I unfollowed a lot of fandom blogs and now I follow study related blogs. It gets old quickly when I&rsquo;m scrolling through similar posts (unfortunately, a lot of study posts look the same) so I have been opening the Tumblr app less. In a weird way, I&rsquo;m also more motivated to post my own original content there. I even automatically post my content from my study blog over here.</p>

<p>Now I totally forgot how I ended this post. I originally wanted this post to be a sort of summer wrap up but I kinda went off on a tangent. One of the habits that I need to work on is to stop talking about 138741287 things in one blog post. I&rsquo;m not really good at the blogging thing but I do it anyway. Like I said, I&rsquo;ll work on it.</p>

          <p><p>I only have one link today, that&rsquo;s the blog <a href="http://altairandvega.net">Altair &amp; Vega</a>.</p>

<p>Altair &amp; Vega is an <em>extremely</em> insightful blog that delves deep into the narrative and art of many popular anime and manga titles. They have a group of multiple authors and while their posts aren&rsquo;t regular, when they do show up on my news feed, it&rsquo;s a great treat.</p>

<p>I forget how I originally got to this site. I probably stumbled upon it through the post on the anime Hyouka, <a href="http://altairandvega.net/2012/07/15/and-you-dont-doubt-your-own-satoshi-fukube-a-character-study/">&ldquo;And You Don&rsquo;t Doubt Your Own?&rdquo; Satoshi Fukube, A Character Study</a>. Despite the fact that it makes a very problematic and most likely false claim saying that Fukube is in love/obsessed with Oreki, it is an incredibly interesting read. Speculating on someone&rsquo;s sexuality is something that should never be okay. In most contexts, it implies the use of applying harmful stereotypes that only further perpetuates them. Thankfully, this article steers clear of this. Instead, it focuses on the behaviour of the characters in the relationship and how the medium portrays these behaviours.</p>

<p>The analysis of Fukube and Oreki&rsquo;s friendship is great in itself, but it&rsquo;s the conclusion that rubs me the wrong way. There seems to be a trend towards assuming that a deep and meaningful friendship suggests that one of the parties sees the other as more than &ldquo;just a friend.&rdquo; In reality, that is not the case. One can be in a shallow and superficial relationship and harbour romantic feelings towards the other person. However, I think the main culprit here is (other than the fact that people <em>love</em> their shipping<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-818" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-818">1</a></sup>) the fact that Oreki and Fukube are both middle school boys. Very rarely do we see friendships between two boys in media where the relationship scratches more than the surface. Two boys sharing their feelings on life and insecurities instead of playing basketball or doing laps around the neighbourhood? Nah, they must be gay.</p>

<p>While this accusation is pretty harsh, I don&rsquo;t necessarily accuse nor blame Altair &amp; Vega for it. In fact, I&rsquo;m extremely glad they wrote this article. As I said before, the analysis of their relationship is superb. They point out specific artistic choices that allude to a certain aspect to their characters I could have never come up with myself (mainly, the shot of Fukube shrouded in darkness while he and Oreki are discussing a &ldquo;rose coloured&rdquo; life blew my mind).</p>

<p>Another article I love to read over and over again is <a href="http://altairandvega.net/2013/01/10/paradise-kiss-and-the-art-of-self-deprecation/">Paradise Kiss and the Art of Self Deprecation</a>. Paradise Kiss is a manga and anime that is very near and dear to my heart. Across my many sites, I love to say that <a href="http://books.mazohyst.org/i-have-an-ai-yazawa-addiction/">Ai Yazawa is one of my favourite mangaka(s?)</a> in the entire industry and I love each and every one of her works. Yazawa has a talent for tapping into the teenaged girl psyche (which doesn&rsquo;t sound that hard but, ugh, she does it so well). I saw myself in Yukari and I sympathized with from start to finish. But like&hellip; <em>The Art of Self Deprecation.</em> This article nails it perfectly. Just read it for yourself.</p>

          <p><p><strong>Warning: Implied misogynistic content, alluding to the USBC shootings, and mentions of rape.</strong></p>

<p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I&rsquo;ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was listening to an episode of the Internet Box, which was recorded around the time when Andrew got a Tumblr and started stirring the pot with the social justice fan community. Dylon was trying to steer away the conversation from using ableism terms and Barbara told Dylon that he has &ldquo;So much to learn about the world.&rdquo; That made me legitimately angry and sad because I really love Barbara but no, Barbara there a couple of things you have a lot to learn too. I wish I could be that blissfully and purposefully ignorant of all the things that my friends and I do that are harmful. In the famous words of Burnie Burns, &ldquo;God dammit Barbara.&rdquo;</li>
<li>My prof asked who was going to watch Maleficent and then he asked if anyone was going to see it because of Angelina Jolie and I think I was the only one who put up their hand??? In a history of video games class filled with mostly males I am confused but also slightly pleased.</li>

<li><p>&ldquo;College is a time when everyone experiences things such as sex, and fun, and pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Idk, I hate how there are people who think this a guaranteed and mandatory and expected &ldquo;college experience.&rdquo; I mean I know &ldquo;fun&rdquo; is objective but I’m pretty sure in this context it means &ldquo;partying&rdquo; and &ldquo;clubbing&rdquo; but college isn’t just that, there are other ways of having fun too.</p>

<p>And god, this guy is just so… So full of it. This video makes me sick to my stomach. We don’t owe people our affections and we don’t &ldquo;deny&rdquo; anyone to a happy life. Wow I’m having a hard time of sympathizing with this guy (which I&rsquo;m not trying to do but he&rsquo;s trying to get us to do). He takes the friendzone to the extreme I can’t wrap my head around how there are people who actually think this way. It just sickens me that people died over this. this is not ok.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay this one is too long to put under a bullet point.</p>

<p>I honestly love Nintendo because they’ve been doing their own thing ever since they got into the video industry. Before no one really cared about bugs in their games but then Nintendo came along and demanded all of their programmers to go through rigorous testing. They controlled what games could or could not be released on their platform (preventing things like <em>Custer&rsquo;s Revenge</em> which was basically a rape simulator for the Atari 2600 made by a porn company). Because of this (and their good games of course) they single-handedly revived the video game industry in the 70s/80s (my prof would be disappointed reading this).</p>

<p>It kinda makes me sad to see them going on a downhill but they are honestly stuck in the old times and very much set in their traditional values and people thought it was unthinkable then, but it’s even more unthinkable now. Although you gotta hand it to them for sticking to their guns. Now I totally get why nintendo does the backward things they do.</p>

<p>And yeah this rant came about because I was totally listening to The Patch. Every week they talk about something that I’m learning in class. Last week they were talking about arcade games and this week they’re talking about Nintendo. I love hearing current &ldquo;news&rdquo; about the things I’m learning it makes things that much more interesting.</p>

<p>TL;DR I&rsquo;m not so surprised about nintendo’s “backwardness” anymore when that’s what they’ve been for the entirety of their existence and once (maybe more than once idk yet??) it actually worked out for them.</p>

          <p><p>Ugh I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had a dream where I literally just lived out my entire day, down to sitting in lecture being bored and taking notes.</p>

<p>You don’t even know how disappointed I am when I woke up knowing that I had to do it all over again.</p></li>

<li><p>I’m using emacs via SSH for my CS assignment and the backspace key doesn’t mean backspace, the del key means backspace AND I KEEP HITTING BACKSPACE. I’m so frustrated. I don’t want to change the settings either because what if I do something I shouldn’t do because I’m on my university&rsquo;s servers.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes I like to think that my faith in humanity is so strong that I can leave my stuff anywhere at the university without asking anyone to watch it but I just really don’t want to talk to people.</p></li>

<li><p>so I just listened to DIR EN GREY’s new single. Sustain the Untruth. Hmm. I think it will grow on me. I like the intro and outro (dat bass), the synth, and all that typical Kyo vocals (he sounds so sinister, wow, I&rsquo;m not surprised though). The chorus sounds a bit out of place to me. Overall it’s okay but I think it’s kinda anticlimatic.</p>

<p>BUT OMG. RUTEN NO TOU ACOUSTIC VERSION. That’s some godly music right there. But back to STU. the music video is also kinda lack lustre. How did the deg shoutbox put it? Kyo is like a zombie mary magdalene I don’t understand.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday I was mailing stuff (now three months ago) and there’s this guy at the mall who works at the knives store and he has a sweet mohawk. I was sitting nearby putting stamps on envelopes and an old lady asked him if she could touch his hair. it was kinda cute but at the same time I wonder if he was annoyed but he sounded really cheerful so I guess not?</p></li>

<li><p>The best thing about Lindsay having a tumblr though is when she reblogs posts about Michael or about her and Michael and kinda fangirls over it. She’s like living the ultimate fangirl dream like, &ldquo;You see the person in this post? I’m getting married to this guy.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>I feel so happy for recognizing Rie Fu’s voice but it’s only because she sang in really fluent English. Hourou Musuko is the sweetest anime I have ever watched. Yeah, it’s a slice of life school anime but I really love how it treated the LGBTQ issues. It all seems so perfect though. If only more people facing those issues received the support the characters did. And if only people reacted the way the characters did. Wow, so sweet.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-809" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-809">1</a></sup></p></li>
