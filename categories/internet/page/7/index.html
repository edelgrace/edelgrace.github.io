          <p><p>I have a whole load of things to do this weekend. Not sure if I&rsquo;ll actually get around to doing those said things. But at least my midterms are finally over! But finals start up in two weeks. Huh. Now that I&rsquo;ve made a list of things I need to, it doesn&rsquo;t really seem like that much but considering my procrastination habits, it is quite a lot. Weekends are for relaxing, not for drowning myself in tears. Funny how my calculus teacher in high school once said that his roommates in university only did homework on Sunday afternoons. 12 hours is not enough to do homework anymore. And I definitely started typing &ldquo;homestuck&rdquo; instead of homework, Hussie what are you doing to me? So yeah, here&rsquo;s my list of things to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computers post-lab</li>
<li>Computers pre-lab</li>
<li>Computers in-lab</li>
<li>Behaviour of liquids, solids, and gases lab</li>
<li>Calculus homework</li>
<li>Linear algebra homework</li>
<li>Start studying for finals</li>
<li>Work on video game project for design</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a list of things I want to do. Sadly, only one of those things are present on my things I need to do list. It looks like I got my work cut out for me, yeah?</p>

<ul>
<li>Read lots and lots of Homestuck</li>
<li>Work on video game project for design</li>
<li>Replay some Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 (I actually want to read pay more attention to what&rsquo;s happening at least try to)</li>
<li>Write a review/reaction/long ass rant about Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 (I have a lot of feelings about this franchise)</li>
<li>Work on my database of books</li>
<li>Work on other things that require coding of the HTML considering I haven&rsquo;t done that in a while</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a list of what I&rsquo;m doing right now. Gosh darn it, I&rsquo;m so productive.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>Neopets</li>
<li>Reading Homestuck</li>
<li>Thinking of starting my behaviour of liquids, solids, and gases lab</li>
</ul>

<p>I spend too much on Tumblr, it&rsquo;s so addicting. I used to scoff at the idea of micro-blogging but now every time I want to make a really long wall of text, I go straight to Tumblr instead of here. It kinda makes me sad. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s more accessible for my friends. But why do I even want my friends to know about the stuff I do? I think it&rsquo;s some weird social media thing. Like how on Facebook you make your life seem more interesting than it really is. That&rsquo;s kinda like what I used Tumblr for. Tumblr is like a giant mess of my thoughts. If you want to know what I&rsquo;m currently obsessing about, Tumblr is the place to look. It&rsquo;s just really good cathartic way of expressing myself. Social media, why must you do this to me?</p>

          <p><p>Currently I&rsquo;m writing to you from my shiny new WordPress app on my iPod! I&rsquo;m seriously grateful for the WordPress app. I do 90% of my blogging on my iPod anyway. The only mobile thing about the admin section of WordPress is the login page. Typing long things in Safari is a pain as well. It crashes way too often in Safari. Plus, this app is just distraction free. When you&rsquo;re typing, it&rsquo;s just that: you typing. A blank white screen just itching to be filled with words. Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without some HTML shortcuts. They could be handy but I usually do my HTML formatting myself.</p>

<div style="padding:0px 10px 10px 10px;float:left;">
  <img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/20120802-181659.jpg" alt="20120802-181659.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" />
</div>

<p>One of the best things about this app is that it works offline too. It can save drafts locally onto the iPod and as soon as it is connected to the Internet it will be uploaded onto your website. Did I mention that it can work with self hosted sites and WordPress.com sites as well?</p>

<p>Anyway, enough about apps. Summer has been deliciously lazy. All I&rsquo;ve been doing is playing video games and surfing the Internet. Of course, I&rsquo;ve done some &ldquo;productive things&rdquo; like revamping layouts, and finishing up Fanlistings but that&rsquo;s still lazy stuff.</p>

<p>My biggest accomplishment is finishing three video games. Not 100% perfect but you know the deal. I know that&rsquo;s kind of sad but i usually it takes me months to finish a video game. I finished three video games in less than a month. Of course, it was the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Ezio trilogy games that I finished: <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed II</em>, <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Brotherhood</em>, and <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Revelations</em>. I really love that series. Sometimes I confuse the games for each other but it&rsquo;s understandable considering the fact that I played them all one after the other. It&rsquo;s almost my perfect ideal game, almost! AC3 is coming out this October and I seriously cannot wait. Sadly, I&rsquo;m too broke to preorder it though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really a gamer. I&rsquo;m a casual gamer. I like stuff like Sims and Sly Cooper and girly dating sims. So finding a video game that I like that&rsquo;s out of my boundaries is a rare event. The series is just perfect. Awesome yet not too hard gameplay, huge open world, beautiful graphics, detailed designs, complex storylines, a pinch of history, awesome soundtrack, badass characters&hellip; Pretty much everything I would like in a game is in this series.</p>

<p><strong>Fave musician(s) atm</strong>: Uhh&hellip; I actually have no idea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just so you all know, I waded through 7000+ forums posts to find all the YouTube links I wanted to post here. Then I realized I could have used the search function. OTL Anyway, on to the post. Warning, there&rsquo;s a lot here. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d want to read it all but yeah.</p>

<p><span id="more-259"></span></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the weird part of YouTube. Well, not really. The weirdest thing I&rsquo;ve seen is probably the Obscure music video by DIR EN GREY. My mind is seriously boggled at how such a thing is allowed to exist on YouTube but I&rsquo;m glad it does or I would have never been able to bask in DIR EN GREY&rsquo;s glorious music. It&rsquo;s actually pretty surprising at all the different things you can find on YouTube. People from all of the world (minus North Korea and some of C, haha&hellip; Oh, that&rsquo;s not funny) posting videos and watching videos and commenting on videos. It&rsquo;s kinda crazy once you think about it. Just the Internet in general is a concept that I find hard to wrap my head around.</p>

<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m in a roleplaying guild on Neopets. Roleplaying? Guilds? Neopets? Ugh, I&rsquo;m so lame. But yeah. We&rsquo;re not so international. In fact, I&rsquo;m the only one who doesn&rsquo;t live in the US. And I don&rsquo;t live in some exotic foreign place, I live in Canada. Even so, we have such diverse tastes, especially in music. I&rsquo;ve only been part of the guild for two to three weeks, and I&rsquo;ve encountered many different songs and different genres and it&rsquo;s all just great.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve been going out of my genre boundaries and listening to other stuff. There&rsquo;s just so much out there! So, I&rsquo;m going to share my discoveries.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=8tJU9w6_YkI">Rich Fantasy Lives as performed by Rob Balder, Tom Smith &amp; Will Frank</a></strong></p>

<p>Okay, the guild member who recommended this has the coolest music taste ever. I&rsquo;d probably would have never listened to this if I saw the thumbnail. Three average looking middle aged men singing about fantasy worlds? Doesn&rsquo;t seem like my thing. It still really isn&rsquo;t my thing, but the tune of this song is just catchy. Simple, yes, but catchy. It&rsquo;s like a fairytale story you tell your kid but in song form. Very cute.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=8We3xnTmVaA">Trophy by Bat For Lashes</a></strong></p>

<p>Hauntingly beautiful. I don&rsquo;t want to say it&rsquo;s primitive or basic because it is and isn&rsquo;t at the same time. I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe it. It&rsquo;s just great. Hypnotizing. Lulling. Comforting. I don&rsquo;t even know. I wish I knew more musical terms.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoPplpBPQxQ">Technologic by Daft Punk</a></strong></p>

<p>This is definitely not a new discovery, but rather, a rediscovery. Daft Punk. Guhhh. The sounds this duo brings is seriously out of this world. It&rsquo;s almost hard to believe that this music wasn&rsquo;t made too long ago. I feel like I&rsquo;ve grown up with this song. As for the music video&hellip; I&rsquo;m reminded of Furbies that were skinned of their synthetic fur.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUJXJcQDC_s">Innocence by Miku Hatsune</a></strong></p>

<p>One of the guild members really, really, really, really likes vocaloids. I don&rsquo;t blame her. They&rsquo;re pretty cute and most of the music is actually pretty cute. Miku is actually one of my least favourite vocaloids (out of the five that I know, haha) so I was surprised at the cuteness of this song.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhHNCfA7NI">Mr. Saxobeat by Alexandra Stan</a></strong></p>

<p>What. Is. This. Catchy. Trickery. I actually like this, what&rsquo;s with my constantly changing views of music? It&rsquo;s seriously pretty good. Kinda stupid, like a lot of music out of there, but just so damn catchy. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that she&rsquo;s attractive. This song kinda reminds me of t.a.t.u&rsquo;s music but that&rsquo;s probably only because Alexandra is also European.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYxlEq8pHNc">HetaOni Douga what I don&rsquo;t even know</a></strong></p>

<p>From the same guild member who likes vocaloids. I&hellip; What? This is worthy of the &ldquo;weird part of YouTube&rdquo; title. There&rsquo;s 12 minutes of weird Hetalia shit. I don&rsquo;t really like Hetalia and uh, I just couldn&rsquo;t really watch it for some reason? One of my favourite songs is half an hour long and I couldn&rsquo;t pay attention to this at all.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSIV5r1oyQw">Classical Servant of Evil by some Nico Chorus</a></strong></p>

<p>Why does Mystic do this to me? Seriously, this a really pretty cover of what I assume is a really pretty song. I really like this. Although I mostly only watched through the whole thing to see the story unfold. I feel a bit bad because after around 2 minutes in, I was bored of the song. Around the 4 minute mark, things got better but still, that&rsquo;s a long time to be bored in a song.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p9asau6ia4">CLEVER SLEAZOID (cover) by Miku Hatsune</a></strong></p>

<p>Another rediscovery. I first heard this almost year ago I think (so says my comment from 11 months ago). It&rsquo;s kinda funny how much the J-rock fandom seems to despise vocaloids. They always claim &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not real music!&rdquo; Just look at the J-Music confessions Tumblr. Actually, I was on TH3JROCKFAN&rsquo;s Facebook page a couple of days (weeks?) ago when they announced that there&rsquo;s going to be a visual kei/J-rock vocaloid album. A lot of the comments were pretty negative. :/ I was surprised. There&rsquo;s actually a lot of good vocaloid songs out there. I used this video as an example of a decent vocaloid cover. And a Malice Mizer songs as well. What was it?? Syunikiss? Brise? I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=parJWVvSZXs">Rolling Girl by Miku Hatsune</a></strong></p>

<p>Mystic really likes her vocaloids and I can&rsquo;t resist clicking on every single YouTube link that&rsquo;s presented before me. And I actually really like this song. Somehow I&rsquo;m always really surprised when I like the vocaloid songs Mystic recommends.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0IuNv27sOE">England sings the campfire song</a></strong></p>

<p>Mystic also really likes her Hetalia. I think we&rsquo;ve already establish I don&rsquo;t like Hetalia. I don&rsquo;t like this but it&rsquo;s still a discovery.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oOu-vKx7Qk">The Campfire Song (Spongebob edition)</a></strong></p>

<p>My childhood, enough said.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMXwFo4zJIk">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! from Soul Eater</a></strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t finished watching Soul Eater. *sobs at my endless to watch anime list* But I do like this song quite a lot.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdMpJ9Zm2ts">Sombody to Love by CLUBSODA</a></strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny because the creator of the song actually had the guts to go onto 2NE1 videos, find people who like 2NE1, and message them with this song, hoping they&rsquo;d get views. It actually worked. I like this song a lot. Like. The vocalist, Motsu, is so attractive. In her face and in her little mannerism, and ugh, especially her voice. Her voice. Hnnng. Sounds like Koda Kumi (who is apparently one of Motsu&rsquo;s influences). But yes. So catchy. Dubstep, I thought I hated you. I think vocal-less dubstep angers me. But this isn&rsquo;t vocal-less dubstep and I love this song.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhXkguYoJKI">NightmaRe by sNoW</a></strong></p>

<p>From xthrowxdownx&rsquo;s J-Music podcast. Apparently it&rsquo;s from an anime but I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I really <strike>like</strike> love it when Japanese female musicians sing the way sNoW does. I don&rsquo;t know what it is about her voice but I love it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz3QtQMz6uk">The Way You Look Tonight (cover) by Seth MacFarlane</a></strong></p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to tell someone to shut up? Yeah, that was me while watching this video. I don&rsquo;t really know what compelled me to look up Seth MacFarlane (creator of Family Guy, voices of Peter, Brian, Stewie, Quagmmire, and more, if you didn&rsquo;t know). I think was watching the Pearl episode with my brother (the episode when Brian complains about not finding love and he finally does but lol shit happens) and the music sequence comes on and I was looking it up on YouTube. Then I found out, woah, Seth MacFarlane does all of these voices, he drew them all, he&rsquo;s funny, he has his values intact, he&rsquo;s somewhat attractive, <strong>and</strong> he can sing. So, I looked for videos of him singing and BAM he hits me with Sinatra and frigging Sinatra man, Family Guy suddenly makes sense. He&rsquo;s just such a cool classy cat in this video. Just taking drags on his cigar with the hat and crooning into that mic. Flipping fudge. I want to tell him to shut up because he&rsquo;s too talented. SETH MACFARLANE PLEASE.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhFY9x8ATh0">Ugly (Japanese version cover) by Zessei Bijin!</a></strong></p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a recent, recent discovery. I&rsquo;ve been getting into K-pop recently, more specifically, 2NE1 because those girls are gorgeous. I like looking for Japanese covers of their songs and that&rsquo;s pretty much how I found Zessei Bijin! I listened to all of their 2NE1 covers and I subscribed to them immediately. These girls have really great voices. My only complaint is that their songs usually don&rsquo;t start off that well. It takes around 30 seconds to a minute to actually get into the groove of their songs. Which is unfortunate because not a lot of people are willing to stick around that long.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zTUJBFiVLA">Mister (Japanese cover) by Zessei Bijin!</a></strong></p>

<p>I seriously cannot pass up the chance to talk about this song. I. Frigging. Love. This. Song. It&rsquo;s so cute and sexy and catchy, and damn, the girls from Kara are really pretty. I could listen to this song forever and ever and I would never be tired of it. So peppy and cute and uguu.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAnPerDr758">Shiroi Yuki no Princess Wa (cover) by Zessei Bijin!, Zodiac,and Akatsuki Taiyou</a></strong></p>

<p>A seriously crazy good song. I showed this song to Mystic and she actually liked it. Yay. Mystic seal of approval. :D This came up on my YouTube homepage because lol, I&rsquo;m subscribed to Zessei Bijin! Before I watched this video, I never realized that there were more groups like them out there. And male groups. Males that sing vocaloid songs. M A L E S. I like F E M A L E S too but damn, M A L E S. I cannot deny the fact that I love male voices. Especially male voices singing in Japanese. But not to outshine the lovely females in this song. Moon really shines in this song. Like really. There&rsquo;s this one part in the song where she just sustains this note and it sounds so pretty. And Minnie is her usually cutesy self and it sounds like she&rsquo;s getting better. I think I&rsquo;m going to liveblog this song. Okay? I&rsquo;m liveblogging it.</p>

<p>Okay, this is my first reactions to the video and then some. THIS IS KINDA CRAZY BUT I MENTALLY DO THIS WITH ALL OF THE SONGS I LISTEN TO OKAY?</p>

<p>0:21 &#8211; Oh what is this cuteness. The art used in this is gorgeous.</p>

<p>0:43 &#8211; K is really cute okay. Omg now there&rsquo;s Minnie too. MINNIE IS SO CUTE. What. This whole part is too cute. I can&rsquo;t&hellip; Voices this cute should not exist, okay?</p>

<p>1:00 &#8211; Oh goodness, Ann from the Ugly cover. Yes.</p>

<p>1:09 &#8211; I&rsquo;ve never heard of these tw-holy crap yes. Wait. Onion? That&rsquo;s seriously so cute. Onion. ASFASFGSDGLDFK.</p>

<p>1:13 &#8211; More people I don&rsquo;t really know, wow there&rsquo;s a lot of them. I never knew.</p>

<p>2:01 &#8211; RYODO WHY ARE YOU SINGING AGAIN STOP MY OVARIES ARE HURTING.</p>

<p>2:03 &#8211; WHY ARE BOTH YOU STILL STINGING STOOOOOOP.</p>

<p>2:12 &#8211; Ugh, Tonkhai. What a crystal clear voice. So warm it makes me feel all fuzzy and cozy inside.</p>

<p>2:16 &#8211; Omg this Onion. I am crying because he is an Onion and that&rsquo;s what onions do.</p>

<p>2:22 &#8211; SIA. WHAT AN ADORABLE VOICE. IT&rsquo;S ADORABLE.</p>

<p>2:28 &#8211; I really love Antares&rsquo; vibrado what. And Moon is doing that thing again. It&rsquo;s too good. Don&rsquo;t stop Moon.</p>

<p>2:51 &#8211; If I had a drink I would have spitten it out all over my laptop screen. THIS IS THE BEST PART OF THE SONG. NO JOKES. I got goosebumps from this part. The voices sound all beautiful together.</p>

<p>3:11 &#8211; Omg Sia. SoooooOoOoOo cute. A bit breathy, but still cute. KISSUU.</p>

<p>3:21 &#8211; The cuteness continues. Seriously. These girls have to stop being cute I&rsquo;m feeling very self conscious right now.</p>

<p>3:33 &#8211; Beibei and Jun is the best idea. Ever.</p>

<p>3:38 &#8211; Oooh Liana I like her in this part. Still don&rsquo;t know who she is but oooh I like.</p>

<p>3:41 &#8211; Antares what are you doing please stop I&rsquo;m dying here.</p>

<p>3:49 &#8211; Ehmz is so cute. I actually follow him on Twitter and he&rsquo;s so cute. UGUUU.</p>

<p>3:58 &#8211; I love it when Tonkhai sings like this, I can&rsquo;t even register how awesome her voice is.</p>

<p>4:09 &#8211; Holy balls there are a lot of them.</p>

<p>4:12 &#8211; Antares I thought I told you to stop. I love that low vibrado wtf stop.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hOVecXftog">Sayoko (short English cover) by Antares</a></strong></p>

<p>Uh, I really like this song. I&rsquo;ve already said that Antares really stood out for me in the previous video and wow, his voice is like chocolate. The first time I listened to this, I just sat there and replayed it a thousand times. Not only is Sayoko just an amazing song overall, listening to the English cover sung by a great vocalist is too much. I also swear it&rsquo;s not because of the accent because I don&rsquo;t really like accents in the first place opps, I&rsquo;m a horrible female. Plus, his IA and full length non-acoustic covers of the song is flipping amazing too.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Yes, after a couple of months, I&rsquo;m somewhat back! And with a new layout as well. I rather like this one more than the previous one. They were both still extremely simple, but I&rsquo;m not a talented designer. I just like writing a lot (I think). With Brokenphrases, I wanted the layouts to be similar to each other. As in, using certain elements (in this case, the logo and the broken two-coloured circle) but with a different structure. I moved the sidebar over to the right (oooh, revolutionary) and removed the footer. There are still some kinks here and there, mostly in the pages and such.</p>

<p>This new layout is supposed to reflect a new change in Brokenphrases. You can see in the nav that there are three new links. Life, music, and books. &ldquo;Life&rdquo; is all of my posts about, well, my life. This will lead you back to Brokenphrases. However, &ldquo;music&rdquo; and &ldquo;books&rdquo; will direct you to my subdomains that are specific to those things. As well, I&rsquo;ve installed a plugin that will have posts from those subdomains showing up here on Brokenphrases. All this fancy talk is kind of confusing, so just go click on the link yourself.</p>

<p>On my subdomain blogs, they also have a new layout that is similar to Brokenphrases. I want to emphasize the link between all three blogs. Eventually I will link &ldquo;my photoblog&rdquo; (Tumblr =P) here to Brokenphrases as well. But I&rsquo;m not used to the Tumblr layouts so that will have to wait.</p>

<p>The main reason why I did this is because I realized I was posting more on my side blogs rather than on here, Brokenphrases. I&rsquo;ve been blogging here and there since April (still not as much as I would like to be though) but it has been happening. Then I realized that not everyone notices my other blogs, or even knows about it. Hence, the linking of my three blogs.</p>

<p>But the reality is, I probably still won&rsquo;t blog as much, despite these new developments. University is coming up, and lol, engineering. From now on, I&rsquo;m just going to post as much as I can. But yeah, that&rsquo;s my PSA of the day.</p>

<p>Currently, summer is decent. My dad leaves for the Philippines this Saturday for two weeks. My grandfather isn&rsquo;t doing so well. He was pretty sick last week, which is why my dad booked a flight. Just two days ago my grandfather was hospitalized. It sounds serious. My aunt (from my dad&rsquo;s side, obviously) and her kids yesterday came over. They&rsquo;re going to the Philippines as well and staying for around a year. My aunt tried Skyping some of my relatives but it didn&rsquo;t work. Since my aunt doesn&rsquo;t have the best financial situation, she had to use our phone to call the Philippines. It was kind of distressing to hear her try to talk to my grandfather. A lot of crying. I really can&rsquo;t take any crying. I hope my dad makes it in time. Minus the situation, I&rsquo;m quite jealous of my dad, actually. I miss the Philippines like heck right now and ugh.</p>

<p>My Last.FM stats as of July 2012. I use Last.FM a lot, without my knowledge basically. Whenever I open up iTunes, Last.FM secretly scrobbles my music as I listen. Also, whenever I plug my iPod in, I get a dialog box that asks if I want to scrobble everything. Well, obviously. So this makes for interesting stats. I definitely know which artists I need to stop listening to (COUGH LARUKU AND DIR EN GREY COUGH). <span id="more-261"></span></p>
