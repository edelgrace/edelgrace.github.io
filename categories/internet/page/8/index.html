          <p><p>Lent is over. I haven&rsquo;t visited Room 304 or Goodreads in over 40 days. Geez, I have a lot of catching up to do. I did read over those 40 days but definitely not a lot. I&rsquo;ve been swamped with school work and going to sleep at midnight every night doesn&rsquo;t leave much time for reading.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve resorted to audiobooks. Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;lazy way of reading&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve been craving some sort of world that I can delve into and just absorb. Lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to audiobooks while doing homework or when I have a free period in class. Somehow I can manage listening perfectly to an audiobook and manage to do calculus questions (and get them right) at the same time.</p>

<p>So far my favourite audiobook is <em>Seriously&hellip; I&rsquo;m Kidding</em> written and narrated by Ellen Degeneres. Usually I&rsquo;m quite weary about celebrities writing books but whew, this one was just so entertaining! Yeah, it&rsquo;s full of laughs but what else do you expect from a comedian? Ellen is just a ball of excitement and fun. Plus, hearing her narrate her own words really made it lively. However, I do want to read the printed version some time soon.</p>

<p>But yeah, I have quite a lot of catching up to do. I wasted my whole Easter Break trying to do homework and I&rsquo;m kicking my butt over it. I said I would do my homework in two days so I can have free time for the rest of the week but that didn&rsquo;t happen. So now I have 130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, couple of questions of calculus, a chapter&rsquo;s worth work of physics, and a workbook in social to do.</p>

<p>After I do all that, hopefully I can update my reading list. Here&rsquo;s what I have so far:</p>

          <p><p>Tomorrow marks the beginning of Lent. Last year I gave up Tumblr for Lent. This year I&rsquo;m giving up using the Internet (minus school things). So for the next 40 days I won&rsquo;t be posting, commenting, reading, e-mailing, Twittering, Facebooking or anything that has to do with the Internet. My poor Neopets are going to starve to almost death (that&rsquo;s the the first thought that came to my mind, how sad). I&rsquo;m not sure if I can do it but hopefully I can. I enjoy testing my discipline but I always feel frustrated when I&rsquo;m tempted. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I got my diploma results back. In my province, anyone taking grade twelve courses have to take diplomas, which are basically just final exams.</p>

<p>So the mail came and I stared at the envelope. I opened it in a frenzy and just held the piece of paper. I was scared to open it. When I did, I let out a sigh of relief. I got 86% on my math diploma, well above the 75% I was expecting. My overall mark for math went down 1% which I&rsquo;m thoroughly grateful for. Now chemistry is a whole different story. My mark dropped 6 whole percentages which kinda sucked but I did better than the 70% I thought I would get. I got a 78% which is decent considering <strike>how much I studied</strike> the lack of studying I did (16 hours including diploma prep).</p>

<p>Yeah. A lot my friends did amazingly well, which I&rsquo;m kind of jealous about. Like in the 90s range! Guhh, I wish I studied harder, especially for chemistry. At least I still meet the requirements for engineering which is my main goal, as many of you already know.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s it for today. Goodnight!</p>

          <p><p>Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&rsquo;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong. I&rsquo;m hoping for the best. But I&rsquo;m still worried! My stomach hurts just thinking about it! Thankfully I don&rsquo;t have to go to school until Tuesday. Even then, it seems like not a long time.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I wrote my chemistry, I went to the library and stayed there for a good hour. I took out eight books. <em>Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)</em> by Lee Young-You, <em>Cirque Du Freak (Volume 7)</em> by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai, <em>Perfect Match</em> by Jodi Picoult, <em>Poster Boy</em> by Dede Crane, <em>The Truth About Delilah Blue</em> by Tish Cohen, and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami. You can read more about why I got those books <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/at-the-library-1/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Later on in the evening, I went to a youth group meeting at my parish. It was my first time there (and the first youth group meeting in a year) but I knew everyone there so I didn&rsquo;t really have to worry about social interactions and such. There was a lot of discussion going on, which was quite enjoyable I think. I&rsquo;m not much of a talker so I just listened. I left with a lot to think about, actually. The theme of that meeting was basically being aware of what&rsquo;s happening in the world. Of course, being young adults, we got off topic quite a couple of times but each topic was just as meaningful as the first. I&rsquo;m hoping to go regularly if time permits.</p>

<p>So, a couple days ago I finally transferred my domains from Go Daddy to Namecheap. Why? Because of the constant complaints I always hear about them, the poor customer service, and of course, SOPA. Yes, I do know that Go Daddy no longer supports SOPA and that SOPA is less likely to exist but the fact that they said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t support SOPA anymore&rdquo; right after Wikipedia and thousands more said they were going to move all of their domains from Go Daddy doesn&rsquo;t make them trustworthy in my eyes. It&rsquo;s quite apparent that they only made that statement because of all of the money and potential customers they lost. Good bye Go Daddy and good riddance!</p>

          <p><p>Yes, it is finally December!</p>

<p>The first day of December was okay. In math I got my last unit test back. 91%! But then I got my quiz back. 64%! My marks have such variety, don&rsquo;t they? I felt like my math teacher was giving me disappointed looks all through class because I did so bad on this quiz. This unit we&rsquo;re doing, permutations and combinations, is really weird for me. I get the answers right in my homework but I&rsquo;m not getting it. I understand what to do but I just don&rsquo;t get it. I&rsquo;m not used to thinking like this. It&rsquo;s stuff like probablity. I was never good at probablity. I prefer formulas that are concrete and don&rsquo;t require much thinking. Ugh, I hate this unit. I said that to my friend with such force and venom in my voice, I think I scared him or made him think I was a freak. Well, I&rsquo;ll just do super amazing on the unit test and then my math teacher will replace the mark. But I hate looking at that 64%&hellip;</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much about today except for the math thing, haha. In spare I just do homework, physics is such a bore, and chemistry isn&rsquo;t something where many exciting things happen. Actually, that last bit was a lie. My chemistry teacher has such a sweet personality. Her jokes are plentiful. Although it&rsquo;s not enough to energize me and keep me awake. I&rsquo;ve never fallen asleep in any class but I&rsquo;ve been close to, especially last period (which is chemistry for this semester).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no drama right now, which is always a plus. Although my friend&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend is getting deported back to his home country (which is the reason why they broke up) which is dramatic but not really. It&rsquo;s quite saddening because they were such a cute couple.</p>

<p>Oh, and I must mention that I opened my very first fanlisting!</p>

<p>If you are a fan of index cards, please don&rsquo;t hesistate to join. ^^ I also applied for a Yukihiro Awaji fanlisting today. I love him so much, he&rsquo;s one of my favourite musicians! Forever my bias.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s all for today. I am once again trying to post as much as I can. I predict many posts with little to no comments as I don&rsquo;t have enough time for blogwalking but I will reply to any comments I receive asap. :D</p>

          <p><p>Last Wednesday, the marching band (with a few concert bandies) hosted a workshop for the junior highs in the Catholic School District. It was mostly a ploy to get junior high kids to join marching band if and/or when they come to our school. Sadly, concert band wasn&rsquo;t emphasized in any way (I&rsquo;m part of concert and apparently I&rsquo;m inferior to marching band kids HAH I beg to differ). It was fun regardless. There was over 300 kids in total. At the end of the workshop, we all played together as one mass band. It was loud. My little brother is in junior high right now and he went to the invitational. I was so proud to see him play and such. I dote on him too much but I can&rsquo;t help it.</p>

<p>Wow, tomorrow is December! I actually can&rsquo;t believe it. Over the weekend we put up the Christmas tree. I&rsquo;m ready for a nice long break (<strike>that will be spent studying orz</strike>)! My birthday is in 31 days, not including today. The only bad thing about having a birthday near the end of the year is that you&rsquo;re one of the youngest people in your grade. One of my friends in my grade is already 19 (when she moved to Canada from the Philippines, she went down a grade because of language problems but still). And Christmas is in 25 days. To be honest, I&rsquo;m mostly excited to do the Advent Calendar on Neopets, haha.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to sign off. It may only be 10 PM but I am dead tired.</p>
