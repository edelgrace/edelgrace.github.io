          <p><p>Here&rsquo;s my weekend in a nutshell: lazy and wonderful. I did almost nothing and I loved it. Too bad this is the last long weekend until Christmas break. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll hold out until then. So, here&rsquo;s a slightly more detailed view of my weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday:</strong></p>

<p>Woke up early for my dentist appointment. My mom still makes me go to a pediatric dentist because I’m not yet an adult, haha. I was told that I have nice teeth yet I have cavities and I need my wisdom teeth pulled out. Ouch. Also, the assistant dentist asked if I was in grade eleven and I dumbly said yes, thinking I was still in grade eleven.</p>

<p><strong>Friday:</strong></p>

<p>Got my friend to change my password for Tumblr so that I don’t procrastinate anymore. I still procrastinate.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday:</strong></p>

<p>Told myself I would finish my homework. I finished my fanlisting collective, a fanlisting, and worked on my book log. Productive procrastination, yay!</p>

<p><strong>Sunday:</strong></p>

<p>Went to church, joined a Tumblr guild on Neopets, talked to the people there for a good two hours, and got someone to sell me a Christmas paint brush for half price. I proceeded to paint Eluxus (my kougra) Christmas. One dreamie pet down, two to go! Also, I favourited a gazillion songs on YouTube. Then I finished my homework. Okay, I didn’t finish it but I have spare first period so I’ll just do it then.</p>

<p>I hope everyone else had a good long weekend as well!</p>

          <p><p>I usually don&rsquo;t post on weekends, even though it&rsquo;s when I have the most free time. Even with free time I&rsquo;m usually wasting it, haha. Although today, I did something somewhat productive, which was retweak the layout! I&rsquo;m not sure if you lot like it, but I do. The fancy @font-face works well, haha. As you can see, I used a font in several place. It&rsquo;s called <em>Asenine</em>. I love this font, and that word. I think I went overkill on it. But no matter. Also, I made the layout wider, centered some things a bit, made things bigger, etc. I had fun with it.</p>

<p>If you look at the sidebar, you&rsquo;ll see that I have watered it down, and added a <em>Tumblr Feed</em> widget. I&rsquo;m usually on Tumblr a lot, so you guys can see what I like to post from time to time. Right now it&rsquo;s a fyeahbandbuffalo picture. It&rsquo;s so relevant to my life, it&rsquo;s not even funny.</p>

<p>A little update on me. I&rsquo;ve been getting into Neopets lately, LOL. Someone mentioned it to me so I thought, I want to play that again! So I did. And now I&rsquo;m addicted. I named all my pets after my favourite celebrities&hellip; Oh my, what has become of my Internet life? Neopets and Tumblr!</p>

<p>Some other internet things. I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot more online comics lately. Wow, there are so many talented and dedicated people out there! My favourite ones at the moments are <a href="http://nopinkponies.keenspot.com/">No Pink Ponies</a>, <a href="http://myth.smackjeeves.com/">MYth</a>, and <a href="http://yourrhapsody.smackjeeves.com">Your Rhapsody</a> (although it&rsquo;s barely started). I have no idea how some people can draw magnificent masterpieces once or twice a week. It looks like it takes a really long time. I really adore those kinds of people. I wish I could draw well. I just draw as a hobby.</p>

<p>Anyway, I really should be getting back to studying. I have three unit tests this weeks. Egads. Wish me luck!</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I was browsing through some blogs yesterday and came across a blog dedicated to a cat. The blog, <a href="http://sisinmaru.blog17.fc2.com/">I Am Maru</a> is ridiculously cute. It&rsquo;s about a cat named Maru who lives in Japan. The owner likes to take pictures of Maru and put cute captions underneath it. I really think it&rsquo;s adorable.</p>

<p>I love cats. They&rsquo;re just so fluffy and moody (for some reason, that&rsquo;s what I love about them). Sadly, I&rsquo;m 99% sure I&rsquo;m allergic to cats. My eyes get red, puffy, and watery whenever I&rsquo;m around cats. I also sneeze like a maniac. It&rsquo;s unfortunate because I&rsquo;ve always loved cats. Maybe one day I could get a hairless or hypoallergenic cat. Like a sphynx or something. Although, anything that&rsquo;s hairless kinda freaks me out. Remember Kim Possible? I looked at a real picture of a real naked mole rat because of it. After that, I was never the same again. Sphynx cats kinda looks cute though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I start school in nine days. I&rsquo;m excited but a bit scared. My last year of high school! Then I&rsquo;ll be somewhat pushed into the real world.</p>

<p>I took some of your suggestions and started looking at scholarships and such. There&rsquo;s a lot of them. I found this one scholarship that give $3,000 for every year for three years if you&rsquo;re studying on the oil and gas industry, which is exactly what I&rsquo;m planning on doing. That would be <strong>a lot</strong> of help. So I&rsquo;m going to have to work even harder this year. My schedule is packed and I anticipate a whole load of work. Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna relax as much as I can over the next nine days.</p>

          <p><p>Wow, it&rsquo;s already August! I can&rsquo;t believe it. Summer is half way done. No way. I wish summer break was longer. I don&rsquo;t want to think about school yet. Although I&rsquo;m extremely excited to start shopping for school supplies. That&rsquo;s honestly my favourite part of going back to school. I&rsquo;m in love with stationary. Notebooks and binders are something I go through very quickly&hellip;</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. It looks like I haven&rsquo;t blogged in a while, but I have. A lot of my posts that I made within the past nine days are set to private. Why? Because they contain very personal content and I don&rsquo;t want to have a physical diary. For some reason, I have more motivation to do it on my blog than on paper. I&rsquo;ve been keeping diaries for a while and because of that my family members are more likely to find it. I&rsquo;m horrible at hiding the fact that I have a diary. There&rsquo;s absolutely no privacy in this house. Seeing that my parents are technologically illiterate, I am basically free to do whatever as long as my parents aren&rsquo;t watching over my shoulder. As for my brother, what I say on the Internet doesn&rsquo;t bother him as long as I don&rsquo;t bad mouth him (which I don&rsquo;t). So yeah, this blog is like a diary to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday I came home from camping for two days. For some reason, camping isn&rsquo;t that fun for me anymore. I miss the old days when my family, extended family, and family friends would always go camping as a big huge family. There hasn&rsquo;t been a gathering that big in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but I&rsquo;ve been thinking about family a lot. My family here in Canada and in the Philippines. A couple of days ago, I was Skyping with my cousin and my grandparents in the Philippines. I guess you can say I&rsquo;ve been under the weather since then because I really miss my family that lives in that part of the world. My parents want to visit since my grandmother&rsquo;s health is rapidly deteriorating but the trip will cost too much and with me going to university in a year, it just seems out of the question.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve never been filthy rich but we&rsquo;ve been comfortable. A couple of times we&rsquo;ve had some rough spots when it came to money but we managed to always get by. My parents have always stressed the importance of education because they never had the opportunity to continue theirs after high school. The Philippines is a third world country and my parents worked insanely hard to get here in Canada. Since my parents don&rsquo;t have a good education, they&rsquo;re stuck with part time jobs. On top of that, they&rsquo;re always sending money to their family in the Philippines and they&rsquo;ve been doing that for the past twenty years. They&rsquo;ve managed to sponsor some of my aunts, uncles, and cousins to come here to work in Canada to do the same. Yeah, my family is still definitely luckier than others but we still have problems.</p>

<p>I know my mom is worried about her own mother and I just feel guilty that my going to school could prevent her from seeing my grandmother one last time. For me, family would definitely come first before education but my mom also has her heart on me going next year. But money is a big issue.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just wish money was never an issue. Not with just my own problems but with the whole world. Money is just a source of problems but I guess that without money, our world would be in even more chaos than right now but that&rsquo;s an entirely different issue. The world is just unfair.</p>

<p>How I got into this topic, I don&rsquo;t even know. This blog post was all over the place but I feel a whole lot better after letting out some steam. Ah, the day in the life of a second generation immigrant.</p>

<p><strong>Updates</strong>: Finally opened!</p>

<p>Today Brokenphrases is officially open for business! If you want to know more about the site and myself, feel free to go <a href="/about">here</a>. So, I&rsquo;ve finally opened Brokenphrases after a year of endless hiatuses and revamping. As you can see, I&rsquo;ve imported as many of my old blog posts from Ueda&hearts;Love, Pure Orenji, and old Brokenphrases that I could find. Why? Because I feel so giddy when I see those old posts. Plus, I&rsquo;d never read them if they stayed as databases and text files. Anyway, I hope this will stick around for good (they always say that, don&rsquo;t they?).</p>

<p>I have quite a lot of free time now that exams are over. I only took one exam, English. I&rsquo;m just horrible at reading comprehension (which is basically what the final exam was) and whenever I think I did good, the results show me otherwise. I&rsquo;m glad I got it over with, but I&rsquo;m still worried about my mark. Let&rsquo;s just hope that I did alright.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m reading a novel by Ryu Murakami called &ldquo;Piercing&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s quite possibly the most terrifying thing I&rsquo;ve ever read but I lobe it! The novel revolves around a man who has a strong desire to stab his baby every night. He never goes through with it but one day he decides to relieve his desire through stabbing someone else other than his daughter. The rest of the story is well, disturbingly great. Murakami is known for his psycho-thrillers and gosh, they aren&rsquo;t kidding when they say he&rsquo;s a master at horror! At least once I&rsquo;m done this book I have over a dozen chick lit novels I can indulge in&hellip;</p>

<p>Well since it&rsquo;s currently around 12 in the morning, I&rsquo;m singing off. Take care guys!</p>
