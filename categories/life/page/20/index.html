          <p><p>I was awakened in the middle of the night by bursts of light penetrating my closed eyelids. As I opened my eyes, I saw what looked like a meteor shower. For a second, it looked beautiful. But as my lids rose up,a light followed it. Up. Why is that light going up? The skyline glowed with golden orbs and light shot out from them. The lights curled and twisted. And instead of end shortly with a boom like a firework or fading with a fizzle like a sparkler, the kept going up into the sky until my head couldn&rsquo;t look any higher. Missiles. Were those&hellip; Missiles?</p>

<p>Shortly after, a large object slowly fell through the sky. I could hear the whistle. The whistle of an inevitable bomb. I braced myself and waited. I didn&rsquo;t close my eyes. I watched it land what looked like a far ways. The horizon glowed with the impact and there was a delay. A short delay where you start to think, &ldquo;why is anything not happening?&rdquo; but the shaking of the earth interrupts you.</p>

<p>I managed to stumble my way from my room to the kitchen as the ground shook me to my core. I prayed the floor wouldn&rsquo;t give out from under my feet. The lights were on. My parents were already up and they were calm. Did they know in advance?</p>

<p>The TV flashed with warnings. At one moment, it showed a high quality 3D map of the city (you know, like the ones you see in the big Hollywood movies). A part of the city flashed red. I only heard two words. South. East. That&rsquo;s where I am. Right now. That&rsquo;s where I live.</p>

<p>I panicked. What do I do? I&rsquo;m not ready to die.</p>

<p>The TV ignored me and showed more images. Men &#8211; soldiers- gathering under the fire streaked sky. They held up flags of the United States of America and France. What an odd combination. But the flags looked almost beautiful. Red. White. And blue.</p>

<p>A logo filled the screen and questions filled my mind. The logo was just like the flags: red, white, and blue. A few words were displayed under the sphere of colour. Columbia. Columbia? As in the university?</p>

<p>The rest I don&rsquo;t remember enough to write. I woke up and I was extremely shaken even though the dream was pretty ridiculous when I went over it in my head.</p>

<p>&#8211; Milky cloud dudes</p>

<p>&#8211; The girls who wanted to form a band</p>

<p>&#8211; The busy walk</p>

<p>&#8211; The restaurant, my missing friends</p>

<p>&#8211; The tattoo and the attempt</p>

<p>&#8211; The guy who tried to pretend to be my bf???</p>

<p>&#8211; The scene sitting with my family in the dark, praying the rosary</p>

<p>&#8211; The glimpse of people crowded in bathtubs</p>

          <p><p>I’m still waiting to fall in love with a book. I want to open it and never want to put it down ever again. I want to find myself in it. I want it to drag out the dark from inside of me and then I want it to tell me that it’s okay and to list all the things that are good about me. I want to read it and never look at life and humanity the same way again. And not for an hour, not for day, not for a month, not for a year, but for the rest of my life. I want to be able to read it again and again and each time it will be different but each time it will become even more beautiful than before. I want it to become familiar, so familiar that I could just know the amount of times the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; appears on page 86 but every time I quote a line from memory, it will read with a new meaning.</p>

<p>I say I’m waiting to fall in love with a book but I think I’m just waiting to fall in love with a person.</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, I really want a book (an actual book) to grab me. The closest thing I&rsquo;ve come to one is <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Bronte. I love that book. I&rsquo;ve sadly only read it once but I now I feel like I should read it again.</p>

<p>Even now, the mere mention of the name &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo; evokes a pang of pain and sympathy (and no, not because of Lucy Stillman even though I do feel pain at the sound of her name but that&rsquo;s a different kind of pain).</p>

<p>Lucy is an ironic name. &ldquo;Light,&rdquo; The first thing you see in a new morning. Hope. Optimism. No, Lucy has no hope and her life is a pessimist&rsquo;s dream (or rather, nightmare). Her last name says more about her than her first: Snowe. &ldquo;Cold.&rdquo; Lifeless. But at the same time snow is white: pure and innocent.</p>

<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s entirely innocent or pure, there&rsquo;s still something beautifully naive about her. Her isolated nature brings out a sort of awkwardness. She pores herself into her books, makes believe that her unrequited love might just love her back (all the while knowing that he doesn&rsquo;t), indulges in her isolation, doesn&rsquo;t allow herself to feel true anger at the mere child who stole her unrequited love from her, reason destroys her because she feels like she is just a tool to be used by others, reason doesn&rsquo;t allow her to enjoy life because she knows there isn&rsquo;t much to enjoy, and there&rsquo;s just so much about Lucy Snowe that is beautiful.</p>

<p>And then there was that rare event when someone fell in love with her and she fell in love back. Someone who didn&rsquo;t find her as an odd girl but was in love with her Protestant quirks, her quick wit, and her abundant knowledge. They planned to get married but her lover is swept away by the sea.</p>

<p>How tragic. How utterly tragic. Lucy, there is no hope for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Me she had forgotten. I was changed too; though not, I fear, for the better. I made no attempt to recall myself to her memory: why should I?</em></p>

<p><em>I would have given two francs for the chance of getting that book once into my hands, turning over the sacred yellow leaves, ascertaining the title, and perusing with my own eyes the figments which, as an unworthy heretic, it was only permitted me to drink in with my bewildered ears.</em></p>

<p><em>I suppose he regarded my silences as eccentric.</em></p>

<p><em>This hag, this Reason, would not let me loop up, or smile, or hope: she could not rest unless I were altogether crushed, cowed, broken-in, and broken-down. According to her, I was born only to work for a piece of bread, to await the pains of death, and steadily all life to despond. Reason might be right.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;I believe if you had been a boy, Lucy, instead of a girl &#8211; my mother&rsquo;s god-son instead of god-daughter &#8211; we should have been good friends.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;You are good, you are beautiful; but you are not mine.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8216;I live in solitary.&rsquo;<br />
&#8216;But solitude is sadness.&rsquo;<br />
&#8216;Yes; it is sadness. Life, however, has worse than that.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p>This was my second year going to my local con. Last year I went all three days but this year I just went one day. It was a lot of fun but also soooo exhausting!</p>

<p>It was typical weather for my city: snowing. Ugh. Gross. I got there earlier than I wanted, so I had to wait in line. In the snow. Thankfully, I wasn&rsquo;t waiting for too long! The line was so much faster than last year. Instead of walking around the building to the front entrance, they just let us in through the back doors. Less time waiting outside and less time spent walking outside is fine with me. The line itself was also a lot more organized. They split up the line into more lines instead of making arbitrary groups as the line moved. It was a lot more faster that way. Thank goodness!</p>

<!--more Read the rest of my con shenanigans!-->

<p>I went with two friends of mine and their friends. It was a lot of fun! My friend, P, dressed up as Petra from the anime <em>Shingeki no Kyojin</em>. She was the only one who cosplayed. She didn&rsquo;t get a lot of people asking for pictures and she actually enjoyed it that way. I think it&rsquo;s because not a lot of people who go to the con don&rsquo;t pay much attention to anime. But she looked super cool anyway!</p>

<p>We parted ways soon after, and Petra and I went (semi-window) shopping! For two hours. I mostly did the shopping, haha. But I also took a lot of pictures. There were a lot of awesome cosplays, and ahhh. They were all really awesome.</p>

        Another Commander Shepard cosplayer. I had to chase down this guy and I called after him saying, "Exuse me, Commander Shepard!" and I felt a little bit like Emily Wong (a journalist in the game). It was surreal. Also it took forever for me to focus the camera and I giggled out of awkwardness (I should have explained myself, I hope he didn't think I was laughing at him...). That poor guy had to stand there for like a minute. Whoops.

        Jessica Rabbit. What a classic. This girl was so sweet and so gorgeous. Aweh, I get all mushy inside just thinking about her reaction to me calling her gorgeous.

        Halo dudes from Halo. I don't play this game (PlayStation all the way), but I love any cosplay with armor. I also love this picture because the dude on the left is looking forward and it's like the dude on the right is just like "Bro, what are you looking at?"

        A Pyscho enemy character from Borderlands. This guy was cool. His eyes were glowing and everything. I think I saw him last year too, and maybe at Otafest at well. But dang, that detail. He looks like he basically stepped out of the game!

<p>In the middle of the day, a friend and I went to get a photo op with the lovely Jessica Nigri, a cosplayer and Internet celebrity. She also does a voice in the RWBY animated series. She was super cute and super pretty! We got to get her to sign our photo with her, and her agent didn&rsquo;t let us pay for it. What an awesome dude. He was as upbeat and cool as she was! Probably one of the highlights of my day.</p>

<p>Also, in the picture, you can see that I&rsquo;m all buddy buddy with Nigri but my friend is really far away from her. It&rsquo;s now a running joke that he and her are&hellip; Close. Haha.</p>

<p>After that, we wandered and shopped a little bit more. We ended the day with attempting to get into a panel but it was really packed so we didn&rsquo;t get in. Which was okay with me because I was about ready to pass out! And so we parted ways and went home.</p>

<p>Onto the merchandise&hellip; I spent exactly $100 dollars, including food and not including transit and coat check. My brother asked me to buy something Rooster Teeth (not happening as they are the only ones who sell their stuff and they&rsquo;re based in Texas so&hellip; Yeah&hellip;) or League of Legends. The only LoL thing I found was really basic messenger bags and they were like $40. Sorry brother, you aren&rsquo;t getting that&hellip; But I did end up buying him a Grunt POP! figure. My brother looooves the Krogans from Mass Effect and the Grunt figure was so adorable that I knew he&rsquo;d love it! When we opened up the box, my brother immediately when &ldquo;Aweeh, he&rsquo;s so cute.&rdquo; The figures are so tiny, he fit in my freakishly small hand! So. Cute. I really wanted to find a Garrus figure but was unable to do so. I think they&rsquo;re really popular because the Garrus figure is even cuter than the Grunt one, and because Garrus is like THE most loved character in Mass Effect.</p>

<p>I also bought some Homestuck merchandise. I debated getting a Scalemate plushie, but opted for the art instead. The calendar has been on my wish list ever since it came out. While I wasn&rsquo;t particularly found of the tarot cards, it was such a deal to get them. I don&rsquo;t regret it at all. I have a love for &ldquo;predicting&rdquo; things (I don&rsquo;t take it too seriously though) and with the gorgeous art and the cards, I think I&rsquo;ll have a lot of fun with them. I also kinda feel like Cardcaptor Sakura. I need to buy those (Clow Cards) next&hellip;</p>

<p>Lastly, there were a lot of cosplays that I wasn&rsquo;t able to take pictures of or didn&rsquo;t see. A moment of silence for these amazing cosplays: Sakura from Cardcaptor Sakura, Satsuki and Ryuko from Kill La Kill, my friend cosplaying Blake from RWBY, Ruby and Weiss from RWBY, dude wearing a &ldquo;People Like Grapes&rdquo; shirt, girl wearing a &ldquo;Free Edgar 2014&rdquo; sign, Kaworu and Shinji from Evangelion, countless Connors and Ezios and Edwards from Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, and Trickster Jane from Homestuck. I&rsquo;m sure there are more but I just can&rsquo;t think of them at the moment. I also wanted to meet Westy from the Mikecast but it&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to randomly bump into a specific person who is not cosplaying.</p>

<p>I saw cool people and I bought cool things. Overall, it was a pretty rad day.</p>

          <p><p>I went out with some friends today. It&rsquo;s funny because every time we go to this ramen place, our local anime convention has an event. Last time it was their mini winter com and this time they were having a trading pin party up at the university.</p>

<p>But yeah we went to eat ramen. It was yummy. And then we bought candy. That was yummy as well.</p>

<p>But my friends also gave me presents which was really weird wow. Look at all this stationary I can&rsquo;t wait to use them.</p>

<p>My friend got me fabric instead of washi tape because she couldn&rsquo;t find any but it&rsquo;s okay because I&rsquo;ll find a way to use them. I already used the bear stickies. They&rsquo;re so adorable!</p>

          <p><p>My exams ended relatively early last semester. That meant more time for a break! I didn&rsquo;t do terribly a lot over through break though. Definitely was not as productive as I would have liked to be.</p>

<p><strong>Finished watching and reading Shingeki no Kyojin</strong></p>

<p>Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime. The Internet has been basically exploding over it (my part of the Internet anyway). My friends in real life also freak out over it and so much so that I just had to see what they were on about. I definitely watched the last 13 episodes all in one sitting. It&rsquo;s a really awesome anime. The world and plot is cleverly crafted. Oh, you don&rsquo;t even know how clever the plot is!</p>

<p>I also finished reading the manga, starting from the very beginning. It was <em>really</em> good. The manga is ahead of the anime and if you thought the anime was clever&hellip; Just you wait until you catch up with the manga. I guess the good thing is that the anime is really close to the manga.</p>

<p><strong>Set up my Filofaxes</strong></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what a <a href="http://filofax.co.uk">Filofax</a> is, it&rsquo;s a company that makes binders that hold planner pages. They come in several sizes, colours, materials, and designs. They&rsquo;re also a bit expensive&hellip; I bought three and am currently using two. One is wallet and one is my day planner. I took a couple of days to personalize both. They&rsquo;re not 100% done but I like them the way they are right now.</p>

<p><strong>Turned 19</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, I turned 19. Big whoop. I&rsquo;m getting older. Upside is that I&rsquo;m the youngest out of my group of friends. I won&rsquo;t feel too old once everyone starts turning <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> this year. ;) But yeah I had a nice little get together with high school friends. All of my exclusively university only friends are from out of town and were away for the break which was understandable. It&rsquo;s so good to see my high school friends though. I really have to keep in touch with everyone haha.</p>

<p><strong>Played a lot</strong></p>

<p>My brother bought Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 4: Black Flag and my friend lent me all of the Metal Gear Solid games. I mostly played Assassin&rsquo;s Creed over the break. It was good but not as good as I hoped it would be. Eventually I&rsquo;d like to post on that as well.</p>

<p><strong>Did nothing</strong></p>

<p>Those were my biggest accomplishments for the winter break. Not entirely world changing but the goal was to relax, which I did! I wish I worked on my websites even a little bit but I opted for working on my Filofaxes instead. I just might have to dedicate a section in Ainsley<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-429" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-429">1</a></sup> to projects like those. Don&rsquo;t worry, I put it in my planner to-do list.</p>
