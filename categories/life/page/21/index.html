          <p><p>Okay, for two weeks I told myself that I would watch the Worlds for figure skating but now I have some time to watch some of it. In typical &ldquo;me-fashion&rdquo; these posts are purely for my own enjoyment (that is the philosophy of this blog anyway sp yes, I am extremely vain!). <strong>I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT FIGURE SKATING.</strong> I just enjoy watching it. Read on if you dare!</p>

<p><strong>Opening ceremony</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I love the little figure skating girls! And I&rsquo;m so sorry, but as they were doing the flag bit, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think &ldquo;that is how you use props, Adelina.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m so sorry&hellip; I like her but that just sprung into my mind&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Pairs Short Program</strong></p>

<p>Wow, I picked a stream with absolutely no commentary. This is a little bit discomforting. Weird. Now I don&rsquo;t know if something was truly &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;good&rdquo; in terms of how stuff should actually be done. Also, wow I can see their current score? This actually makes me so anxious.</p>

<p>But seriously, watching that score makes me nervous wow.</p>

<p><strong>Austria (Miriam Ziegler and Severin Kiefer)</strong></p>

<p>A bit slow at the end. They looked so disappointed when they were done though. Aweh, don&rsquo;t frown, I enjoyed it!!</p>

<p><strong>Great Britain (Amani Fancy and Christopher Boyadji)</strong></p>

<p>I wish my last name was Fancy. Also, Fancy is 16 years old?? Whaaat?? Awehh Fancy, it&rsquo;s okay that you missed that landing. Aweh, oh no I feel so bad! They way Fancy twirled down after that lift though, wow. That was beautiful. Happy birthday to that girl they mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine (Julia Lavrentieva and Yuri Rudyk)</strong></p>

<p>Aweh, it looked like Lavrentieva made a two foot landing. Still looked impressive though. I hate it when skaters make mistakes early in their program because I don&rsquo;t want them to worry too much and let it affect the rest of it. Kudos to the skaters who can overcome but it makes me worried too! Not sure if I&rsquo;m digging their music a whole lot.</p>

<p>Is it just me or did the three first pairs have the same coach or something?? The dude(s?) who greeted all three of them look the same. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not paying enough attention, lol.</p>

<p>Also, is this The Fray playing in the background? Lol what.</p>

<p>Omg no, I know this is the kiss and cry but nooo, please don&rsquo;t cry!</p>

<p>Ahhh it&rsquo;s the warm up and the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the US pair just fell. Nooo don&rsquo;t let it affect you, Zhang, noooo.</p>

<p>Aaaand now they&rsquo;re playing Marianas Trench. Who picked this playlist?? Japan, please.</p>

<p><strong>Germany (Maylin Wende and Daniel Wende)</strong></p>

<p>Aweeh are they married?? Or siblings??<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-737" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-737">1</a></sup> Digging their song choice. Holy shoes, that lift was beautiful. And Maylin almost fell on that toss (throw?? I wonder what the real term is), but she saved it. You go girl! Spins are usually my favourite part about figure skating and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get used to how slow pairs are at those spins. And ommmg he kissed her when they finished. Awehhh. Now that is a ship I won&rsquo;t feel guilty for shipping. Ommmg in the K and C, Maylin just made the cutest gesture.</p>

<p><strong>USA (Felicia Zhang and Nathan Bartholomay)</strong></p>

<p>Omg I&rsquo;m so digging their song choice. Loving their speed. That toss flip thing was pretty fast as well. Gosh, that must take a whole lot of trust. And yeeah Zhang landed that jump. And the second one too. Also, I heard someone yell &ldquo;YEAH!!!&rdquo; in the stands, LOL. Omg, she&rsquo;s soo cute.</p>

<p>Seriously, what is with this playlist playing in between each skate??</p>

<p>Wait, did they just lower their score from 35 to 33? Ouch.</p>

<p>Also, the dude that greeted them. Totally hot. Just saying.</p>

<p><strong>Italy (Nicole Della Monica and Matteo Guarise)</strong></p>

<p>The Japanese announcer said &ldquo;Italy&rdquo; in Japanese and I was so confused like &ldquo;what does Hetalia (the anime) have to do with figure skating?&rdquo; but then I remembered Hetalia is Italy in Japanese. I am seriously so ashamed right now. Loving their musicality so far. Ouch, that landing on the toss wasn&rsquo;t A+. Oh no, a touch down on that jump. That costume on Guarise is not flattering at all. Costume designers, what are you doing??</p>

<p><strong>Russia (Julia Antipova and Nodari Maisuradze)</strong></p>

<p>Gooooo Russia. Antipova looks so darling and cute!! I love her costume too. She looks so tiny compared to Maisuradze! Omg. I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about how tiny she is. I mean, she is 16 but Fancy is 16 too but Fancy isn&rsquo;t as tiny as her. How werid is it for these 20-something guys to dance with 16 year old girls? Omg her Russian is great though.</p>

<p>Okay, I approve of them playing Panic! at the Disco. All the other music choices are iffy.</p>

<p><strong>Japan (Narumi Takahashi and Ryuichi Kihara)</strong></p>

<p>Oh no, they&rsquo;re both soooo cute. Also, what?? Takahashi is 22 and Kihara 21?? Noooo way. She looks so young! They both look so young! Not a fan of Kihara&rsquo;s outfit. Once again, costume designers, please. Ouch, only a 2.80 so far? Wait, it bumped up to 6.00. Still. Ouch. I&rsquo;m loving their step-ish sequence part (I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called, I don&rsquo;t know what most things are called, I&rsquo;m so sorry). Also, yesss. Loving their speed on their spins. Omg Ryuichi is sooo cute.</p>

<p><strong>Belruse (Maria Paliakova and Nikita Bochkov)</strong></p>

<p>Holy buff. Bochkov looks so buff and muscular. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because male figure skaters just look too skinny. Loving Paliakova&rsquo;s costume. Bochkov&rsquo;s? Not so much. These poor men. Omg they&rsquo;re both really cute, too. Omggg. What a beautiful language they&rsquo;re speaking! Bochkov is too adorable in the Kiss and Cry.</p>

<p><strong>Estonia (Natalja Zabijako and Alexandr Zaboev)</strong></p>

<p>Zaboev&rsquo;s hair is to die for. Why is it that these girls who are over 20 totally do not look like they&rsquo;re over 20?? Loving Zabijako&rsquo;s costume though. Also, wow, that spin toss thing. Wow. Pretty. The music choice is so fun. And ahhh they looked so synchronized in their jump. Wow, I&rsquo;m so loving this program so far. Sad their technical score isn&rsquo;t 100% great. Aweh. I&rsquo;m hoping for a 50 from this pair. Aweh, 46.11 is still good!</p>

<p><strong>Bulgaria (Elizaveta Makarova and Leri Kenchadze)</strong></p>

<p>Wow, Kenchadze is smoking. Loving the song choice. So spicy. So high energy.</p>

<p>Aaaand my stream stopped working<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-737" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-737">2</a></sup>. I guess that means I should start working on my homework. Ugh, waiting for Hanyu is sheer tortue.</p>

<p><li>

          <p><p>The Monday after reading week is always the worst, that is. I told my friend who is from the States that I had reading week and she had no idea what it is. It&rsquo;s pretty much a Canadian/Commonwealth countries thing where we get a couple days off in the middle of the semester. I heard from the grapevine that reading week started because mid-semester is a period when too stressed out students tend to commit suicide.</p>

<p>To be honest, reading week makes me more stressed out! Mostly because I always plan to be productive and study but then I end up doing nothing at all and it makes me stressed that I did absolutely zilch. It definitely doesn&rsquo;t help that all of my midterms are the week after reading week. Ay&hellip;</p>

<p>So what exactly did I do all week, if not studying?</p>

<p>Mostly <a href="http://mazohystic.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and the Olympics. I&rsquo;m usually not a big sports fan but this year I found myself really invested! Mostly because of the super cute<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-593" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-593">1</a></sup> and super adorable<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-593" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-593">2</a></sup> and super talented<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-593" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-593">3</a></sup> Japanese figure skater and gold medalist, Yuzuru Hanyu. Ever since I disovered this skating genius, I became engrossed in the figure skating world. I watched the FP (free skate program, also called LP/long program) and watched him win gold!</p>

<p>Favourite men skaters at Sochi (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yuzuru Hanyu</strong><br />
Do I even have to explain again?</li>
<li><strong>Patrick Chan</strong><br />
Ah, my fellow Canadian. It was awesome he got silver for Canada. He&rsquo;s a great guy and super cute as well. He&rsquo;s so strong, masculine, and &ldquo;stereotypically&rdquo; athletic. A strong contrast to Hanyu, who&rsquo;s really feminine, soft, and almost whimsical. I really appreciate that about Chan. Oh, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSPbjVsv1ug">his exhibition</a> was pretty great, too. It was weird trying to see him &ldquo;let down his hair.&rdquo; It was almost awkward but he had enough charms to pull it off. He was smoooooth. There&rsquo;s no one else I&rsquo;d rather have for silver!</li>
<li><strong>Denis Ten</strong><br />
The bronze medalist. This guy really captured my heart. He&rsquo;s a skater from Kazakhstan and he&rsquo;s GREAT on the ice. Technically strong and had so much artistic quality. I also came across really cute gifs of him on Tumblr. He&rsquo;s such a cute dork! His exhibition was super cool. It featured Kazakh folk music and was really intense. My jaw was open pretty much the whole time. wOW. Plus he favourited one of my Tweets on Twitter. I&rsquo;m still freaking out about it.</li>
<li><strong>Kevin Reynolds</strong><br />
Ok, this guy is super awesome. In his SP (short program), he skated to ACDC. Who skates to ACDC in figure skating?? This guy. He&rsquo;s such a rockstar. He fell a couple of times, which visibly affected him. It was disheartening to watch him react to his low score. However, in his FP, he definitely redeemed himself. He looked like a Greek god, and skated like one too, if Greek gods could skate. It made me really happy! Oh, and he&rsquo;s CANADIAN. So. Proud. To. Be. Canadian.</li>
<li><strong>Jason Brown</strong><br />
Technically, Jason Brown was my gateway to figure skating but Hanyu just gave me that final push. I saw a video of Jason Brown <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzlcVKFVWVI">doing an Irish dance</a> in one of his skates on Tumblr, and I was just in awe. He has so much personality and poise. He doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;the jump&rdquo; (the ever elusive quad) that others do but there&rsquo;s something about him that just draws you in to his performances.</li>
<li><strong>Daisuke Takahashi</strong><br />
I missed out on his SP but I did watch his FP. Even so, I only need that to know he&rsquo;s legendary. It&rsquo;s a shame that he&rsquo;s retiring because, ugh, the talent he has! His exhibition was fabulous. There was absolutely no denying his talent.</li>
<li><strong>Tatsuki Machida</strong><br />
I will admit, I only watched his exhibtion. But it was one of my favourite skates from Sochi purely because it was pretty amazing. He skated along to Queen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop Me Now&rdquo; and it was awesome and lighthearted. Not to mention, there was a sweet air guitar bit in it too.</li>
<li><strong>Javier Fernandez</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m so sorry, Javi, but I only watched your exhibition as well&hellip; And to be honest&hellip; It was super hilarious. It featured a medley of songs with bits where he recorded himself in an imaginary role of a gym trainer. It was full of personality and just made me giggle and smile throughout the whole thing. I mean, come on, how can you not love a hot Spanish skater skating to himself saying things like &ldquo;A body like this just doesn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo;?</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t restrict myself to just male skaters, contrary to popular belief. I watched the ladies in it&rsquo;s entiriety. It was an emotional rollercoaster.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Isadora Williams</strong><br />
She wasn&rsquo;t one of the strongest contenders for the medal, but I just loved loved loved her FP. It was super smooth and seductive!</li>
<li><strong>Akiko Suzuki</strong><br />
This girl is a trooper. She suffered from anorexia and successfully overcame it! I really think Suzuki is one of the prettiest ladies that was present at Sochi. She&rsquo;s seriously so adorable. I love her smile, I&rsquo;m always smiling along with her. It hurts after a while because it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s always smiling! Her dress in the FP was breathtakingly beautiful. I really loved it, she skated so sweetly. She was just like a ballerina! It&rsquo;s a shame that she&rsquo;s retiring as well. Then again, she was the oldest female skater there. 28 years old doesn&rsquo;t sound much but that&rsquo;s old in figure skating. Man, I totally thought she was way younger! I love her youthfulness!</li>
<li><strong>Polina Edmunds</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m not sure if Edmunds is really thin or really lanky or a combination of both. Her limbs are really long and she uses it to her advantage. She&rsquo;s super graceful on the ice! I loved how the commentators talked about her. They made her sounds a bit cocky but in a playful non-insulting way. She just has a lot of confidence! I love seeing that in her! And I don&rsquo;t blame her for her confidence. She was stunning on the ice.</li>
<li><strong>Mao Asada</strong><br />
Please don&rsquo;t talk to me about Mao Asada. I&rsquo;m absolutely smitten by this lady, almost as smitten I am by Yuzuru! I&rsquo;ve heard she is a skating legend in Japan. Plus, she&rsquo;s had a rivalry with fellow female figure skater &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; Yuna Kim, which means she is WAY up there. I watched the SP with great anticipation for Asada&rsquo;s skate. It wasn&rsquo;t at all what I expected. She fell on her first jump, a triple axle if I recall correctly. That was okay but she let it affect her performance and missed other jumps as well. It was really just super sad, you could see her get super frustrated. Everyone thought she&rsquo;d be on the podium but she just lost her chance. However, the next day, she <strong>slayed</strong> the competition, earning the third highest mark for that day and the fourth highest mark of all time. She definitely redeemed herself. The skate was beautiful (as was she), technically great (she landed eight hard jumps), and just so emotional (I was getting so teary eyes because I couldn&rsquo;t stop think, &ldquo;Mao you deserve a medal!&rdquo; and then she started crying as well). Definitely my number one favourite of the entire 2014 Winter Olympics. Emotionally charged and beautiful!</li>
<li><strong>Carolina Kostner</strong><br />
There was something beautiful about her performances. She skated cleanly, had the &ldquo;star power&rdquo; to captivate you, and was all around breath taking. I really enjoyed them and she earned her bronze medal! Her costumes were pretty awesome too, wow.</li>
<li><strong>Yulia Lipnitskaya</strong><br />
This kid is only 15 years old and she is AMAZING. She&rsquo;s so extremely graceful on the ice. It&rsquo;s just beautiful to watch her skate. I was mesmerized the first time I saw her skate! She&rsquo;s definitely Russia&rsquo;s figure skating sweetheart for sure.</li>
<li><strong>Yuna Kim</strong>She&rsquo;s the queen of figure skating. I prefer Asada but Kim is definitely Asada&rsquo;s equal, if not, she&rsquo;s better than Asada. She is pretty much technical perfection.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I definitely wrote this a week ago and I&rsquo;m already done with all of my midterms.</p>

<p>Computer Science: B+</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not happy with this, haha. I was 0.5 away from getting an A-! I&rsquo;m so disappointed, haha. Then again, I literally studied for this midterm for maybe a total of three hours, and even that is generous. I guess it&rsquo;s a good enough mark for barely studying. I should have studied. Then I would have my A-/A!</p>

<p>Religious Studies: A+</p>

<p>Oh goodness me, I am so happy for this! I totally did not expect this mark. I got a 99%. Technically, he curved it and I got lower but after the curve, I have 99%. I&rsquo;m pretty darn happy about this.</p>

<p>Philosophy: ??</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know yet. I&rsquo;m sure that I did not do as well as my first Philosophy midterm. I was shaky on some of the short answers and I don&rsquo;t think I did the essay to the best of my ability. I&rsquo;m hoping for a B/B+!</p>

          <p><p>I went out with some friends today. It&rsquo;s funny because every time we go to this ramen place, our local anime convention has an event. Last time it was their mini winter com and this time they were having a trading pin party up at the university.</p>

<p>But yeah we went to eat ramen. It was yummy. And then we bought candy. That was yummy as well.</p>

<p>But my friends also gave me presents which was really weird wow. Look at all this stationary I can&rsquo;t wait to use them.</p>

<p>My friend got me fabric instead of washi tape because she couldn&rsquo;t find any but it&rsquo;s okay because I&rsquo;ll find a way to use them. I already used the bear stickies. They&rsquo;re so adorable!</p>

          <p><p>My exams ended relatively early last semester. That meant more time for a break! I didn&rsquo;t do terribly a lot over through break though. Definitely was not as productive as I would have liked to be.</p>

<p><strong>Finished watching and reading Shingeki no Kyojin</strong></p>

<p>Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime. The Internet has been basically exploding over it (my part of the Internet anyway). My friends in real life also freak out over it and so much so that I just had to see what they were on about. I definitely watched the last 13 episodes all in one sitting. It&rsquo;s a really awesome anime. The world and plot is cleverly crafted. Oh, you don&rsquo;t even know how clever the plot is!</p>

<p>I also finished reading the manga, starting from the very beginning. It was <em>really</em> good. The manga is ahead of the anime and if you thought the anime was clever&hellip; Just you wait until you catch up with the manga. I guess the good thing is that the anime is really close to the manga.</p>

<p><strong>Set up my Filofaxes</strong></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what a <a href="http://filofax.co.uk">Filofax</a> is, it&rsquo;s a company that makes binders that hold planner pages. They come in several sizes, colours, materials, and designs. They&rsquo;re also a bit expensive&hellip; I bought three and am currently using two. One is wallet and one is my day planner. I took a couple of days to personalize both. They&rsquo;re not 100% done but I like them the way they are right now.</p>

<p><strong>Turned 19</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, I turned 19. Big whoop. I&rsquo;m getting older. Upside is that I&rsquo;m the youngest out of my group of friends. I won&rsquo;t feel too old once everyone starts turning <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> this year. ;) But yeah I had a nice little get together with high school friends. All of my exclusively university only friends are from out of town and were away for the break which was understandable. It&rsquo;s so good to see my high school friends though. I really have to keep in touch with everyone haha.</p>

<p><strong>Played a lot</strong></p>

<p>My brother bought Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 4: Black Flag and my friend lent me all of the Metal Gear Solid games. I mostly played Assassin&rsquo;s Creed over the break. It was good but not as good as I hoped it would be. Eventually I&rsquo;d like to post on that as well.</p>

<p><strong>Did nothing</strong></p>

<p>Those were my biggest accomplishments for the winter break. Not entirely world changing but the goal was to relax, which I did! I wish I worked on my websites even a little bit but I opted for working on my Filofaxes instead. I just might have to dedicate a section in Ainsley<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-429" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-429">1</a></sup> to projects like those. Don&rsquo;t worry, I put it in my planner to-do list.</p>

          <p><p><strong>Write a blog post every week</strong></p>

<p>Writing a blog post every day is pretty much impossible for me. However, I still want to post regularly. Posting weekly sounds pretty doable for me. There are 168 hours in a week. If I can&rsquo;t fit in at least one blog post in there, I&rsquo;m going to have to rethink my current time management system.</p>

<p><strong>Spend less than 30 minutes on YouTube everyday</strong></p>

<p>YouTube is a huge time sink. I&rsquo;m sure that many people know this struggle. I hope this is self explanatory.</p>

<p><strong>(Start to) learn a language</strong></p>

<p>I plan to take a language course over the summer. Which language? I don&rsquo;t even know myself. I&rsquo;m debating between Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. All very cool languages that I&rsquo;m very interested in. Russian seems to be a very nice language to listen to. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn Japanese because I&rsquo;ve always been interested in the modern/imported culture<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-396" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-396">1</a></sup>. I&rsquo;d also like to learn Chinese because I am sooo intrigued by the writing system, despite it&rsquo;s alleged difficulty (but I&rsquo;m more concerned about speaking&hellip;).</p>

<p><strong>Finish assignments at least one day before they&rsquo;re due</strong></p>

<p>The obvious exception is if I receive an assignment that&rsquo;s due the next day. I have a problem with procrastination. I got away with finishing assignments the day before last semester because they were very small assignments but apparently the workload next semester will be very heavy.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t skip any classes</strong></p>

<p>I can count the classes I skipped last semester on one hand but I&rsquo;d like to reduce that to a cool zero.</p>

<p><strong>Keep a relationship with my professors and TAs</strong></p>

<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. No, not like that. I want to interact with them more. Go to office hours and ask questions not only about the course but their research as well. Professors always talk about how they wait and wait and wait for people to come and it&rsquo;s true. I once went to one of my professor&rsquo;s office. I walked by it, saw him sleeping, thought it wasn&rsquo;t him, and walked right by it! I made another lap around the floor and caught him waking up. It was his office after all! Obviously he had been waiting for a while. Gotta take advantage of the office hours.</p>

<p><strong>Read 100 books</strong></p>

<p>I was really bad about recording my reading in 2013. I don&rsquo;t know if I read 100 books or not. I know I read at least 60 some books. Let&rsquo;s aim for 100 again!</p>
