          <p><p>My heart hasn&rsquo;t gone doki doki in a while. The last time I can remember is when I was in my freshman year of high school when I was crushing on my first boyfriend<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-216" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-216">1</a></sup>. This was, of course, before last Friday.</p>

<p>On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I have my first class with three of my friends. We all have a break after the class so we eat together. Last Friday, we decided to eat in the ICT building. The first floor of the building has lecture halls, a lot of seats, and some food vendors. The other six floors have some lecture halls but are mostly offices for graduate students and professors. Usually we eat in the building across the road. I prefer it in the other building because the chairs and tables aren&rsquo;t fixed like in ICT and my next class is in that building. However, my friend had hawk-like eyes and saw an empty table in ICT while we were walking through. Why continue to walk through the building <em>and</em> across the street when you can just sit down right away? University logic.</p>

<p>Like I already mentioned, the chairs at ICT are fixed. Four to a table. It&rsquo;s great when it&rsquo;s just the four of us together but when there&rsquo;s one more, it gets hairy. Thankfully the table next to us only had one girl in it and let our fifth addition to the group sit there. Macha and Jean Paul<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-216" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-216">2</a></sup> were fangirling over Shingeki no Kyojin. I haven&rsquo;t finished watching it so I tried my best to ignore their conversation and instead turned my attention to Beardo and Shane<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-216" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-216">3</a></sup>. I was immersed in my conversation, that is, until the elevators across from my opened and a large group of people poured out. I glanced at them, since anything moving catches my eye, and in that group, I see my TA from computer science. I shifted my eyes back to Shane talking, but all I could pay attention to was my heart thumping loudly in my ears and him out of the corner of my eye. &ldquo;Doki doki!&rdquo; my heart practically screamed.</p>

<p>Why did I have such a reaction to my TA?</p>

<p>I find it too weird that I could possibly have a crush on my TA. He&rsquo;s old</p>

<p><sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-216" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-216">4</a></sup>, can barely speak English, is dorky, and not that attractive. On the other hand, he&rsquo;s an older man and therefore more mature, knows two languages, is adorable, and still a bit cute. Did I just write that? Now I know why they call them crushes: I&rsquo;m absolutely crushed. A crush doomed right from the start!</p>

<p>Anyway, an hour later (because all my friends and I do is sit together for like three hours), I see senpai come back from the front doors. We locked eyes. His default face is cute, although he looks angry. I wave. Dammit, Beardo is in the way! As senpai disappears behind Beardo and reappears from behind Beardo, he gives me a crooked grin and waves back. Wow, my heart nearly exploded. I was grinning from ear to ear. I turned to Macha but she didn&rsquo;t notice. I&rsquo;m glad no one really noticed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> My TA is super smart.</p>

<p><strong>Beardo:</strong> Is he super cute?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> *Lies through my teeth* Ehh&hellip; Kinda</p>

<p>&mdash; Beardo and I talking on the train yesterday</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I think about it, I had a lot of doki doki moments with senpai last week. On Tuesday, senpai walked up to me and genuinely wished me luck on our group demo. He looked really sincere and I just liked hearing him tell me good luck two times in one conversation. The next was on the next day. Chan<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_5-216" id="back_ajs-fn-id_5-216">5</a></sup> said, &ldquo;Our TA got a haircut.&rdquo; I looked around and I saw senpai being talked to by the professor with his new haircut. It&rsquo;s a really cute haircut!! It makes him look younger. I instantly grinned. When he came to collect our assignments, I complimented him on his haircut. He did his cute crooked grin thing and was all, &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He turned his head to the side, still grinning. &ldquo;I got it yesterday.&rdquo; OsuDude made a comment about how his default haircut was the same thing. Senpai laughed and said, &ldquo;Default haircut?&rdquo; All the while, people were walking up to him to give him their assignments. He stayed there for a little longer, even though we really had nothing to say to him anymore.</p>

<p>Then there was Thursday. I face palm when I think about Thursday. Before the tutorial I was sitting in the computer lab waiting for the class in the room to be done. I stood up and instantly I just happened to lock eyes with senpai as he walked down the hall. Awkward. I&rsquo;m so awkward! I stood outside the room, pretending to fiddle with my iPod. The room was mostly empty and my TA just stood in the doorway like, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to come in?&rdquo; So I did. I flashed a quick hi and immediately sat down. He approached me instantly, because I was really the only one there. He asked me how the demo went and went off on his way. He then came back (when my group members came) and criticized them jokingly for not doing work. &ldquo;Look she&rsquo;s painting!&rdquo; Chan asked him if he had a watch and when senpai lifted up his left sleeve, Rayman was all I TOLD YOU to Chan<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_6-216" id="back_ajs-fn-id_6-216">6</a></sup> I asked senpai if he was right or left handed. He said he was both and said something about something happening 20 years ago. I then asked him how old he was. Awkward. Awkwaaaard. He said to guess. Chan guessed 22. LOL. Rayman guessed 28. Senpai said he was close. I said 25 because that&rsquo;s what I desperately wanted his age to be. He&rsquo;s 27. Then Rayman was all, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ten years older than me!&rdquo; Senpai made this cute noise and turned to walk in the other direction out of embarrassment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old!&rdquo; he said as he came back. He proceeded to ask us our ages. Rayman 17. Chan 18. Myself, 18 almost 19<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_7-216" id="back_ajs-fn-id_7-216">7</a></sup>. He was all, &ldquo;First year you should have turned 18 or turn 18! Are you a first year?&rdquo; I said no, second year. He said, &ldquo;Impressive.&rdquo; I replied with a &ldquo;not really.&rdquo; At the back of my mind I was like LOL YOU&rsquo;RE THE DUDE GETTING HIS PHD NOW <strong>THAT</strong> IS IMPRESSIVE. He left and came back and asked me what my agenda was. &ldquo;I see you everyday, you bring it to class but I don&rsquo;t know what it is! What is it?&rdquo; I told him he was all &ldquo;Good&rdquo; and left. LOL. While I was doing my work, I senpai was helping out this kid in the row in front of me. I saw senpai leaning on the table, facing my direction, and glancing at me occasionally. Cute. Cuuuuuute. And awkward. Soooo awkward. When I got up to leave, he ditched the kid immediately and walked over to me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving?&rdquo; Yeah. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be in class tomorrow.&rdquo; Me inside: Nooooo. &ldquo;Nathaly can handle it.&rdquo; Really? No way. I look down. We awkwardly say bye and he tells me &ldquo;Have a good day.&rdquo; So awkward. So adorable. So cute. So old. So weird. :(</p>

<p>Why does my crush have to be a foreign TA?? For all I know he&rsquo;s engaged or married. However I think that&rsquo;s highly unlikely because I&rsquo;ve seen him alone with a girl one more than on occasion<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_8-216" id="back_ajs-fn-id_8-216">8</a></sup>. Okay, maybe he has a girlfriend. And the cultural barrier. The language barrier. The possible religious barrier. The age gap barrier. The teacher-student relationship barrier. Too many barriers. It was not meant to be, I think. I&rsquo;ll give it a shot anyway after I get my marks back.</p>

          <p><p>AJ reminds me of Kemal. As much as I&rsquo;d hate to say it, that&rsquo;s the number one reason why I find AJ so attractive. He&rsquo;s like the Korean version of Kemal. Also, I&rsquo;d rather fangirl over AJ than be madly crushing on a guy who probably thinks I&rsquo;m an idiot and who I haven&rsquo;t seen in almost a year.</p>

<p>However, I saw Kemal on campus a while ago and I realized how much they don&rsquo;t really look like each other. Just the overall idea of their faces are similar. I think Kemal is more handsome while AJ is more pretty boy cute. They both have beautifully cheekbones though. :( I&rsquo;m a sucker for nice cheekbones&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably my memory being rusty but I feel like they have similar accents too. Kemal&rsquo;s accent is more Russian and thicker. But they sound very similar! When I watch their lips, they both make the same movements when they speak. It&rsquo;s freaky. I need to hang out with Kemal again to really get a good comparison of the two.</p>

<p>But seriously though. AJ is perfect.</p>

          <p><p>The sun cleared up his eyes and I was instantly lost.</p>

<p>Even when his head turned towards mine</p>

<p>I could not and would not tear mine away from his.</p>

<p>That colour!</p>

<p>I had never experienced it before.</p>

<p>Warm and clear.</p>

<p>I could see forever in his eyes.</p>

<p>I could feel his disappointment</p>

<p>when he looked into mine: an endless dirt pit.</p>

<p>But he smiled at me then, a sweet crooked grin</p>

<p>accompanied by an equally sweet pair of crooked teeth.</p>

<p>A cat-like curl and a crooked grin.</p>

<p>I had never experienced these colours before.</p>

<p>I really wish I could be able to write poems! Poems are beautiful but like I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;m not a writer. Writers have an innate ability to know and feel words and I definitely do not have that. I tried guys, I tried<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-203" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-203">1</a></sup>. If you&rsquo;re wondering what this is about, it&rsquo;s about a random encounter I had while on campus in my freshman year. I hate how encounters on campus are random. Come back, mystery guy!</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m seriously fading in motivation. I just feel really down all of a sudden and all of the time. But then I remember AJ from U-KISS and I remember that he goes to Columbia and works his butt off (I hope). AJ, please give me inspiration!! And yeah, Eat Your Kimchi has officially converted me into a Kiss Me. I have mixed feelings. Be right back while I go blast some acid android and DIR EN GREY. Maybe with some Sadie and SCREW in the mix. I need more SCREW songs. And I have an album that I have yet to give a full listen through by DIR EN GREY. I&rsquo;m so behind in my music! I wish I had money to buy music. ;A; I need a job but I need good grades. Whaaaat is life?</p>

          <p><p>I don&rsquo;t really know what to write about in my blog right now. At first I was like &ldquo;post everyday!&rdquo; but when I got to it, I drew a blank. Not to mention, the 500 words requirement overwhelms me. What can I write about for 500 words??That&rsquo;s why I already missed more than four days of posting. A &ldquo;blog post idea&rdquo; list would be very hand right now. I gotta start writing down said ideas. So I resort to using fictional writing prompts for today&rsquo;s post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Write a scene that starts with the line, &ldquo;Short? SHORT?&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;Sarah Selecky Prompts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Short? SHORT?&rdquo; Daniel bellowed as he held his wallet in one hand and two crumpled bills in the other. &ldquo;The sign said it was only $0.99!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lips of the cashier&rsquo;s mouth tugged at the corners. &ldquo;The sign is for a different product. Many customers have already said the same thing. I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she shrugged and waved the burrito in the air. &ldquo;Do you have another way to pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daniel stared down at his two dollar bills. &ldquo;This is all the money I have,&rdquo; he mumbled. He looked back up at the cashier with pleading eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been walking on foot for days, I need food. Please. I&rsquo;ll take anything for two dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the cashier shook her head. The two stood there for a couple of moments, staring at each other before another customer coughed from behind Daniel.</p>

<p>He gave up. He stuffed his money back into his wallet. On the way out from the gas station, he glanced longingly at a bag of chips and lingered there for a second. The thought appeared in his mind but he pushed it out as soon as it came. He left the store empty handed and with an empty stomach.</p>

          <p><p>I&rsquo;m a victim of the 140 characters. Okay, sometimes I like to say things that are more than 140 characters but you know what I mean, yeah? Tumblr (not Twitter) has conditioned me to want to share my thoughts every time they pop into my head. Fortunately, I don&rsquo;t have Tumblr anymore. Unfortunately, I do have a Twitter. Fortunately, I don&rsquo;t want to use my Twitter<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-177" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-177">1</a></sup> too much because I have only six followers who probably don&rsquo;t care about me at all.</p>

<p>However, I do want to release my thoughts to the wild in some sort of fashion instead of keeping it trapped in my brain where it will be lost eventually. So, here they are.</p>

<ul>
<li>The PS4 came out just yesterday. My friend&rsquo;s friend went to a midnight launch and won a Vita. Lucky duck.</li>
<li>The only reason why I&rsquo;d ever get the PS4 is to play WATCH_DOGS and AC4. I swear I&rsquo;m not a Ubisoft fangirl.</li>
<li>Seriously though, console wars are really stupid. Just pick a console and play it. Who cares what other people buy??</li>
<li>I finished reading <em>Lolita</em> today. &ldquo;Lolita is quite possibly the most beautiful and twisted book I have ever read. Nabokov is a genius&hellip; I had to put down Lolita after barely reading a paragraph because it was too beautifully written for me to handle. Goosebumps everywhere.</li>
<li>I think Arryn<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-177" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-177">2</a></sup> is just an all around adorable girl. It&rsquo;s even more adorable how she fangirls over Miles<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-177" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-177">3</a></sup> on her Tumblr.</li>
<li>The layout for erzadel.net/blog has been tweaked slightly. The title and page/post headings are now centered. Also, fixed alignment with the footnotes and made them just a tad smaller.</li>
<li>Today we put up the Christmas tree. My brother refused to do it for half an hour because he was playing LoL. I wish he never started playing LoL. Now he doesn&rsquo;t want to do anything because if he leaves in the middle of a game, he&rsquo;ll get banned. Lame rules.</li>
<li>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about the new YouTube comment system is the fact that I can&rsquo;t reply to old comments.</li>
<li>I watched a little bit of Mike&rsquo;s MLP Season 3 stream&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t make it through. However, it was only because I was watching Joel and Adam play Cry of Fear.</li>
<li>Vera Wang is really pretty. I wish I would look that good when I&rsquo;m older.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been on a &ldquo;What Would You Do?&rdquo; binge on YouTube. :(</li>
</ul>
