          <p><p>I said before that I&rsquo;m finding it slightly hard to come up with blog topics. Therefore, I am creating a new feature for my blog: Just a Review. It&rsquo;s basically what it seems like: just a review of my day. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a <em>review</em> review but more like a summary. If I rated my days it would be very depressing to look at all the low scores<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-120" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-120">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So, from the beginning!</p>

<p>This morning I woke up. I have alarms on my iPod that go off at five minute intervals. I totally thought I had an alarm for 7:05 but when I finally came to, it was 7:13. It doesn&rsquo;t seem that disastrous at first but it is when I have to leave the house at 7:45! To my dismay I realized that my breakfast was to be porridge. It takes me forever to eat porridge! Although, I&rsquo;m proud to say that I downed that mofo in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>When I got to the station, I didn&rsquo;t get a seat on the bus like I usually do. Not getting a seat on the train isn&rsquo;t a big deal but it is on the bus. The train doesn&rsquo;t make huge turns that doesn&rsquo;t threaten to throw you on the person next to you. As soon as a good chunk of people got off the bus, I grabbed a seat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s getting late and unfortunately I have no time to write the restful this blog post!</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve decided that <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/">Room 304</a> is now officially a book log/archive with minimal blog posts. This calls for a redesign that will emphasize the fact. Why the change? It was always my intention to have Room 304 solely as a book log. But as I heard about book blogging, I decided I would give it a chance. It overshadowed the logging aspect of the site, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like I wanted to update the site anymore. So yes, a &ldquo;new&rdquo; focus for Room 304!</p>

<p>That being said, the blogging part is <strong>not</strong> going away. However, it definitely will not be frequent. I&rsquo;ll just be posting the books I&rsquo;ve bought and/or borrowed from the library. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll do stuff like Follow Fridays (minus the following) and other memes like that but those will be even rarer. So yes. My library haul for the month!</p>

<p>I actually took these books out on the 9th. I&rsquo;ve neglected to post about it but better late than never! I&rsquo;m actually returning a few of them today. In fact, I&rsquo;ve finished reading all of the books except one. Mind you, 80% of the books are manga and/or are &ldquo;easy&rdquo; reads.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the list!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother: Stories of Loss and Love by Xinran</strong><br />
While I was doing my daily browsing of all the aisles in the library, I came across this little gem! I wanted to take it out before, but I felt like I had too many books on my plate. So I came back and got it now!</li>
<li><strong>Alcestis by Katharine Beutner</strong><br />
This caught my eye right away because I really love Greek myths. Especially anything to do with the Underworld. Hades you beast. And poor, sweet, dear, precious <del>fefeta</del> Persephone.</li>
<li><strong>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Forsaken by Oliver Bowden</strong><br />
As soon as I realized that the library actually had Assassin&rsquo;s Creed books, I had to grab them! I&rsquo;ve heard about this book among the fandom and a lot of people love it. Mostly because Haytham is in it? Seeing as how it&rsquo;s a journal of pretty much his entire life, I was intrigued. I also can&rsquo;t bear to miss any piece of canon media.</li>
<li><strong>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Renaissance by Oliver Bowden</strong><br />
Saw this one right next to Forsaken. No regrets.</li>
<li><strong>Kimi Ni Todoke (Volumes 1-7) by Karuho Shiina</strong><br />
This series has been on my to-read list for the looongest time. It&rsquo;s almost been over three years, actually! I&rsquo;ve put it off because it&rsquo;s licensed in English (I know, I&rsquo;m horrible). As soon as I saw several volumes starting from the very beginning, I grabbed them all.</li>
<li><strong>Cirque du Freak (Volumes 8-12) by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai</strong><br />
Okay, I&rsquo;ve been reading this series for around two years. These are the final volumes. I just have to finish what I started!</li>
<li><strong>The Limit (Volumes 1 &amp; 2) by Keiko Suenobu</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m a big fan of Keiko Suenobu. I&rsquo;ve read most of her series, <em>Life</em> and a couple of her works. I&rsquo;ve always had a soft spot for over dramatic high school kids. On a more serious note, Suenobu loves to focus on bullying and I just love the awareness she&rsquo;s trying to spread. She&rsquo;s always a good read!</li>

          <p><p>I went to the library last Saturday! Quite fitting because it is reading week at university. I&rsquo;m probably the only one who takes the &ldquo;reading&rdquo; in reading week seriously&hellip; Anyway, here is my library haul this week in order of the books I remember first:</p>

<ul>
<li>French Milk by Lucy Knisley<br />
I&rsquo;m always a sucker for personal memoir-like graphic novels. The cover is just too charming to not want to read it!</li>
<li>Negima! (Volume 1) by Ken Akamatsu<br />
The name sounded familiar so I though, why not? I picked it up. Turns out Akamatsu is the mangaka for <em>Love Hina</em>. I predict boobs.</li>
<li>Pure by Timothy Mo<br />
Not going to lie, the cover is what did it for me. So pure.</li>
<li>I Shall Not Hate by Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish&rsquo;s<br />
Apparently this has been on my to read list for a while. I don&rsquo;t know how or why but it&rsquo;s been on there! So I finally decided to get it.</li>
<li>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle<br />
I&rsquo;ve been looking for a book I once read in elementary. This is a possible candidate for said book.</li>
<li>The Selector of Souls by Shauna Singh Baldwin<br />
My library was doing a blind date with a book thing. I thought it would be about tapestries. It&rsquo;s actually about India. Close enough.</li>
<li>Daughter of Xanadu by Dori Jones Yang<br />
Another one that&rsquo;s been on my to read list for a while.</li>
</ul>

<p>Books that I still need to add to the log:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moon Boy (Volume 4)</li>
<li>Moon Boy (Volume 5)</li>
<li>Josephine: A Life of the Empress</li>
<li>The Case for God</li>
<li>A whole load more of books&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently got back into reading online web comics&hellip; That was definitely not a good idea&hellip;</p>

          <p><p>I just woke up from a dream and I have to write about it. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s some kind of omen or just a representation of the current state of my mind, but either way, it spooked me pretty badly.</p>

<p>So I was at the train station, going up the stairs to reach the far end of the platform. The stations have walls that are on the sides of the tracks and they join together above the platform to make a ceiling.</p>

<p>As I descended down another set of stairs, my view shifted from first person to third person and I was viewing the station from the side. I saw myself and my friends standing at the middle of the platform but it was crowded so I suggested we move down to the end of the platform, where there wasn&rsquo;t that much of a crowd. I was back in my own body again and talking to my friends, my back towards the train tracks.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard the beeping sound of train doors closing and I turned around to see the train getting ready to leave. I saw a set of door closing and I tried to stick my hand through the narrowing gap to make it open but it was too late and I quickly withdrew my hand. I was angry that my friends didn&rsquo;t tell me the train came and shocked at how I didn&rsquo;t hear it approach.</p>

<p>When I looked back at my friends, I saw that they were no longer there and my family took their place instead.</p>

<p>We heard the trains coming again and looked eagerly towards the tracks. Usually there is only one set of tracks on both sides of the platform but suddenly there were three tracks on the side we were waiting for and well over five on the other side. The platform had shrunk to half the width of a sidewalk and everyone was teetering along the edge.</p>

<p>Another train came by but it ran along the farthest train track and was a freight train. Another freight train came by on the middle tracks. Finally a train came close to the platform but instead it was a private &ldquo;train&rdquo;. It looked like more of a car than anything, with an open hood. Two men had two tanks in the front seat and three off road vehicles in the second row of seats. My dad gave me papers that was in his hand and helped them take the items off the car/cart and the two men went off.</p>

<p>More trains came by on the other side. The tracks on the other side were chaotic and overlapped each other. Trains narrowly missed each other and an idiot driving a car on the tracks was nearly hit as well.</p>

<p>I looked down the platform. People were picking up their bags and leaving. With a worried look on my mothers face, she asked me for the time. I looked at my wrist watch and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quarter to 10, why?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t respond but instead looked off in the distance. I repeated the question until she answered me with, &ldquo;The trains stop running at 12:45.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even realize it was night already. She went on about maybe staying in a hotel for the night and as she did, I sent a text to my aunt in Vancouver explaining what had happened. It was at that moment that I knew that we were in the Philippines for vacation.</p>

<p>I was starting to say something but my mom shushed me when the sounds of an airplane filled our ears. It sounded extremely close, therefore extremely loud, and getting louder every second. I covered my ears thinking, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get hit, we&rsquo;re going to get hit&hellip;&rdquo; and braced myself for our impending doom. The sound abruptly stopped and for some reason, we were at ease.</p>

<p>We were the only ones on the platform now, give or take a person or two. I looked down the tracks and could see the night sky and the twinkling of office building lights and highways.</p>

<p>Suddenly a small airplane filled the view and it descended on the tracks, landing sideways. It scraped along the edge of the platform and against the wall. The wings were mostly torn off and we surprisingly didn&rsquo;t get hit. Another plane came right after it. And another.</p>

<p>Just when we thought it was safe, a large bus on it&rsquo;s side came speeding down the other side of the platform, barely missing us once more. A huge truck came rolling our way, tore through the ceiling, and landed right in front of my brother. I was sure it was going to kill us but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>We waited a couple of minutes and heard more crashes and explosions in the distance. The night skyline turned fiery.</p>

<p>Soon people started to come to the train station to pick up debris and helping any people in distress. It was morning, the sky was a clear blue, and the sun shone light on all of the damage from the night before.</p>

<p>I tried to persuade my mom that we should make a run for it but she said we needed to make eye contact with one of the volunteers. We tried calling help but no one came to our aid even though they were only a meter or two away from us.</p>

<p>I went so far as to lightly hit a woman walking by with the papers my dad handed me. She looked annoyed but said, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mom explained our situation to her in Tagalog and the lady called over the police and we descended onto the tracks. He asked for our passports. I pulled out my dad&rsquo;s passport from the papers and the police frowned because the cover was ripped and damaged but identified my dad anyway. My mom pulled out my brothers passport and he checked in with the police. My mom did the same with hers. But I couldn&rsquo;t find my passport. My mom told the police man that we must have lost it as we did lose our luggage. The police said nothing but wrote some things on to a notepad.</p>

<p>I took out my cell phone and saw that my aunt replied to our text. I don&rsquo;t remember what it said but it was not particularly helpful.</p>

<p>Then the police officer pulled out a fancy smart phone (my phone is a little ghetto Nokia) and showed that we had a video call. My mom said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s PJ!&rdquo; He is a family friend that we were planning to come to the Philippines with at the same time but decided against it. He was already in the Philippines before we got there and in the video call we saw that he and his family were at church, dressed fancy, laughing and smiling.</p>

<p>My mom tried to get their attention but all they did was wave at us and smile. She told me to show them what happened and I plucked the phone from the police&rsquo;s hand and faced the phone towards the wreckage. I gave it back to the police and he ended the call.</p>

<p>I leaned against the wall, pulled out my cell, and asked if I should text any of my aunts, uncles, or cousins in Canada. I listed all the ones that I had on my phone by name and my mom said no to each of them. That was when I woke up.</p>

<p>When I let my friends know that I want to be a librarian after I exhaust my career as a software engineer, one of them laughed at me and said, &ldquo;A librarian with an engineering degree? Are you doing to make houses out of books?&rdquo; I just smiled and responded with a witty comment but inside I wondered, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While surfing the web, I stumbled upon Graeme Ing, a YA author and a former game developer. I immediately saw the parallels between the librarian and the engineer and felt a need to feature him on my blog!<span id="more-293"></span></p>

<p>And so I did.</p>

<p>I got a hold of Graeme Ing and asked him a couple of questions. You can view his answers here in it&rsquo;s total unedited glory, with a couple of comments inserted by me.</p>

<h3 id="when-did-you-realize-that-you-wanted-to-be-a-software-engineer-an-author">When did you realize that you wanted to be a software engineer? An author?</h3>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re going back a long ways! Once I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t be an astronaut (don&rsquo;t all boys want to be one?), I planned to follow my father into the British Royal Navy, and train to be a navigation officer. When I was 15, we got one of the first computers, a 4K Commodore PET. Wow! Anyone remember those, or am I showing my age? We are talking the turn of the &lsquo;80&#8242;s here. After learning to program it and moving on to other computers, some that I built myself, I was totally hooked. From that day forward, all I wanted to do was write computer programs.</p>

<p>As for writing, I&rsquo;ve been scribbling stories since I can first remember. I think I wrote my first at age 8, and it was about a boat that sailed around the world. (Anyone familiar with my debut book, Ocean of Dust, should be putting together the clues right about now.) I even typed a screenplay in my early teens. Of course, all of that was pure junk, but I was having fun, and that&rsquo;s all that matters. It was 7 years ago that I got serious about becoming an author, and started writing Ocean of Dust.</p>

<h3 id="after-you-finished-school-what-were-your-goals-for-your-career">After you finished school, what were your goals for your career?</h3>

<p>Straight out of school, I went on to get a degree in Computer Science, and I strongly recommend that to anyone wanting to become a software engineer. _<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-1378" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-1378">1</a></sup>_ There are basic software principles, like object-orientated programming, design patterns, unit tests, etc., that all good programmers need to know about and perfect. After that, my goal was to go out into the world and get as much programming experience on as many computer systems and languages as possible. At that stage, I hadn&rsquo;t considered writing games.</p>

<h3 id="you-mentioned-in-your-bio-that-you-have-worked-on-several-games-what-are-some-games-you-have-worked-on-and-what-was-your-role-in-their-development">You mentioned in your bio that you have worked on several games. What are some games you have worked on and what was your role in their development?</h3>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Most of my games were written in the late &lsquo;80&#8242;s and early &lsquo;90&#8242;s on the Atari ST, Amiga, and Sega and Nintendo consoles. Since they were created in the UK and distributed throughout Europe, few folks in the USA have heard of them. Raider was one of my favourites, shamelessly ripped off from the video arcade game Gravitar. I also wrote Utopia, an early sim-city type game, and its sequel K240, a 3D point and click called Normality and a space exploration game titled Space Wrecked. In all but Normality, I was both designer and sole programmer. That&rsquo;s how it worked in those days; not like the 10-100 man teams that modern game studios employ.</p>

<p>After coming to the US in 1996, I joined SOE in San Diego and worked as part of the EverQuest and Tanarus MMO teams.</p>

<p>Heh. Exciting and rewarding, but frustrating, all at once. It&rsquo;s a great feeling to string together hundreds and thousands of lines of code and then see it all come to life on the screen. Highly creative. More an art than a science really. _<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-1378" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-1378">3</a></sup>_ The frustration comes when parts of it (or all of it) doesn&rsquo;t work. Then you have to play detective and go through it step by step to figure out why.</p>

<p>Hours are long for a games programmer. _<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-1378" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-1378">4</a></sup>_ Twelve or more hours a day is common, and working weekends is expected at crunch time, leading up to the launch of a game. The camaraderie is super though; everyone working hard as a team, pushing to get the best experience for the player &#8211; the most fun, the best animation, mind-blowing sound, and most realistic AI.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not in the games industry any more, so my days are less hectic, and I get weekends off. :) The routine is largely the same though. Usually the day starts with a team status meeting to see what everyone is working on, and if we are ahead or behind schedule. Obviously, the bulk of the day is designing and programming. (White boards are great for noodling with other engineers). Once you&rsquo;ve written a chunk of code, it&rsquo;s time to send it to the QA department to test, but before that, a good programmer will always rigorously test his own programs first, trying to think of everything that can go wrong, every weird thing the user might do. Finally, even when the game or application is launched, the team is usually fixing bugs and adding new features for months or even years.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-one-get-started-in-the-video-game-industry">How does one get started in the video game industry?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a lot different now than when I started. In those days, you just needed a home computer, an idea, an artist, and a few weeks or months. Having been out of the games industry for a while, I don&rsquo;t claim to have words of wisdom on this topic, but I see two typical ways in:</p>

<p>The first is to start on the bottom rung. Join a games company as a tester (QA), a support rep, server room technician, intern; anything that gets your foot in the door. Most games companies like to promote from within, and they&rsquo;ll spot talent. From any position in the company, you can hob-nob with the games teams, get involved, share your ideas, float your artwork or animation skills, or show off some of your programming. If you have a real passion for playing and creating games, people will see that, and you could find yourself moved onto a games team as a junior artist, assistant programmer, or whatever it is that you want to do. From there, it&rsquo;s just hard work and honing your skills.</p>

<p>Another way is to get a degree and some real-world experience. Be creative and plan your career. If you want to be an artist, why not work for a web software company, or marketing company so that you have a portfolio to show, and experience meeting challenging deadlines. Want to be a programmer? A computer science degree and any kind of experience writing high performance or high-scalability software is going to look very attractive to a games company.</p>

<p>Increasingly, more and more schools and universities are operating degrees and qualifications designed specially for a career in games development. These are worth a look.</p>

<p>As a Young-Adult Fantasy novel, it follows the adventures of a 14-year old girl, named Lissa, when she is kidnapped from her hometown and forced to become a slave on a ship. This is no ordinary ship, however, since it travels an ocean without water, one made of a very fine dust that flows like a liquid. She&rsquo;s such a curious, adventurous girl, that she becomes fascinated by everything around her. How does the ship move without sails? What are the mysterious creatures swimming around the ship? Why does she see and hear things that no one else can? I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to read the book to find the answers. :)</p>

<h3 id="to-what-extent-do-you-plan-before-writing">To what extent do you plan before writing?</h3>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m a software engineer, it comes as no surprise that I&rsquo;m a big planner. I outline the whole story ahead of time. I draw many maps, and work out the chronology and the motivations of every major character. I keep all of this in spreadsheets and text files. I know, totally geeky, right? :) The story usually changes a lot as I write, despite my planning, so I have to be flexible enough to keep revising the outline and the plot. Like writing computer code, I just keep tweaking it until it works. I know that many authors (&ldquo;pantsers&rdquo;) just sit down and make it up as they go along. That amazes me, since the few times I tried that, I got totally lost.</p>

<p>_<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_5-1378" id="back_ajs-fn-id_5-1378">5</a></sup>_</p>

<h3 id="how-important-is-it-to-maintain-an-online-presence-as-an-author">How important is it to maintain an online presence as an author?</h3>

<p>Major authors can probably get away without one, after all, how often do readers need to visit Stephen King&rsquo;s or Dan Patterson&rsquo;s web sites? For new authors, and especially Indies, I would regard it as vital. I think readers are more comfortable trying a new or unknown author if they know a little about them first. Perhaps they like the humour on your Facebook page, or follow your blog, or chat with you on Twitter. I love the closer relationship between author and reader, which is only possible through social media. Gone are the days of the aloof, mysterious writer in their ivory tower. If I can communicate with readers, I can learn what they enjoyed or didn&rsquo;t, which means I can tailor my books to my audience. Then, everyone&rsquo;s happy. :)</p>

<h3 id="are-there-any-online-tools-that-you-find-helpful-for-writing">Are there any online tools that you find helpful for writing?</h3>

<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any <em>online</em> writing tools that I use, but I totally swear by <a href="http://literatureandlatte.com/">Scrivener</a>. What an incredibly powerful tool it is. Using it, I can reorder scenes with a simple drag and drop, I can see my outline, or monitor word count per scene or per chapter. I can track subplots and which scenes each character appears in; all sorts of things that makes life easier. _<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_6-1378" id="back_ajs-fn-id_6-1378">6</a></sup>_</p>

<h3 id="do-you-use-your-local-library-for-research-for-your-books-do-you-generally-do-a-lot-of-research">Do you use your local library for research for your books? Do you generally do a lot of research?</h3>

<p>The nice thing about writing fantasy and sci-fi is that I get to make things up. :) I rarely have to research. When I do, it&rsquo;s usually just Googling about details such as weaponry, clothing or weather patterns, mostly to get the terminology correct. But, just because I invent worlds, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t have to be realistic and consistent. For Ocean of Dust, I pulled on my knowledge of astronomy and navigation. The world in the book has two suns and four moons, and I actually calculated the orbital diameter and time of each one.</p>

<p>I have a book that I want to write that is set in Iron Age Britain. That will require years of research, and I&rsquo;ve already started buying books about the period. Since I love books, I usually buy them. I haven&rsquo;t been to a library in years.</p>

<h3 id="right-now-are-you-primarily-working-on-your-writing-or-developing-games-or-are-you-doing-both-equally">Right now are you primarily working on your writing or developing games or are you doing both equally?</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t work in the games industry anymore, so usually I am just dabbling with game ideas in my spare time, mostly for the Mac and iOS devices. I design role-playing games and scenarios too. However, being an author sucks up most of my free time. Since I&rsquo;m a software engineer by day, I still get the best of both worlds, and I couldn&rsquo;t ask for more than that.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-any-overlap-between-being-an-author-and-a-game-developer">Is there any overlap between being an author and a game developer?</h3>

<p>Totally. You&rsquo;ll find many software engineers that write. Both are creative pursuits. As a games developer, you are helping to create artificial worlds and characters, and that&rsquo;s what an author does too. Writing games has taught me skills that I use as a writer, such as tension, pace, action and above all, entertainment.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-next-for-you-more-books-maybe-some-games-what-are-your-goals-for-the-future">What&rsquo;s next for you? More books? Maybe some games? What are your goals for the future?</h3>

<p>Definitely more books. Lots and lots of books. I have a list of ideas that would take a lifetime to write. Maybe one day I might feel compelled to release some more games. I&rsquo;ve thought of going retro &#8211; reinventing some of those simple but ridiculously addictive games from the &lsquo;80&#8242;s. With the advent of Apple&rsquo;s iAuthor tools, perhaps I can combine games and writing into interactive stories. I also have plans to publish a few role-playing scenarios. Plenty to keep me busy.
