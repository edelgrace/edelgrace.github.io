          <p><p>Even though yesterday technically has a post, I did not post it until today. Therefore, I missed a day. Being the procrastinator that I am, I usually leave these blog posts until around 11:00pm at night, when I&rsquo;m lying in bed. However, last night I was not lying in bed. Instead, I was seated in front of my brother&rsquo;s laptop, trying to finish an essay. My essay was not due today but I ended up staying up until 3:30 in the morning working on it.</p>

<p>My university has an amazing program that provides a sort of mentoring guidance relationship with an advisor. I enrolled in the program to make sure I make through my probation year without any hiccups. This is my first time writing an essay in well over a year and I knew I needed extra help with it.</p>

<p>So my advisor told me to bring over my first draft of my essay so that we could go over it together. I expected the worse because the review of my outline wasn&rsquo;t 100% spot on.</p>

<p>To much relief, it went okay. Call me a weird person but there&rsquo;s something fascinating about a typed page covered in red ink. It&rsquo;s an even bigger relief knowing that I&rsquo;m slightly ahead and not having to torture myself on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning typing the whole thing up without proofreading. All I need to do now is retype it with all of the changes I need to make. It sounds effortless but I need to make a lot of changes.</p>

          </div>

          <p><p>I said before that I&rsquo;m finding it slightly hard to come up with blog topics. Therefore, I am creating a new feature for my blog: Just a Review. It&rsquo;s basically what it seems like: just a review of my day. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a <em>review</em> review but more like a summary. If I rated my days it would be very depressing to look at all the low scores<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-120" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-120">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So, from the beginning!</p>

<p>This morning I woke up. I have alarms on my iPod that go off at five minute intervals. I totally thought I had an alarm for 7:05 but when I finally came to, it was 7:13. It doesn&rsquo;t seem that disastrous at first but it is when I have to leave the house at 7:45! To my dismay I realized that my breakfast was to be porridge. It takes me forever to eat porridge! Although, I&rsquo;m proud to say that I downed that mofo in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>When I got to the station, I didn&rsquo;t get a seat on the bus like I usually do. Not getting a seat on the train isn&rsquo;t a big deal but it is on the bus. The train doesn&rsquo;t make huge turns that doesn&rsquo;t threaten to throw you on the person next to you. As soon as a good chunk of people got off the bus, I grabbed a seat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s getting late and unfortunately I have no time to write the restful this blog post!</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve decided that <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/">Room 304</a> is now officially a book log/archive with minimal blog posts. This calls for a redesign that will emphasize the fact. Why the change? It was always my intention to have Room 304 solely as a book log. But as I heard about book blogging, I decided I would give it a chance. It overshadowed the logging aspect of the site, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like I wanted to update the site anymore. So yes, a &ldquo;new&rdquo; focus for Room 304!</p>

<p>That being said, the blogging part is <strong>not</strong> going away. However, it definitely will not be frequent. I&rsquo;ll just be posting the books I&rsquo;ve bought and/or borrowed from the library. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll do stuff like Follow Fridays (minus the following) and other memes like that but those will be even rarer. So yes. My library haul for the month!</p>

<p>I actually took these books out on the 9th. I&rsquo;ve neglected to post about it but better late than never! I&rsquo;m actually returning a few of them today. In fact, I&rsquo;ve finished reading all of the books except one. Mind you, 80% of the books are manga and/or are &ldquo;easy&rdquo; reads.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the list!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother: Stories of Loss and Love by Xinran</strong><br />
While I was doing my daily browsing of all the aisles in the library, I came across this little gem! I wanted to take it out before, but I felt like I had too many books on my plate. So I came back and got it now!</li>
<li><strong>Alcestis by Katharine Beutner</strong><br />
This caught my eye right away because I really love Greek myths. Especially anything to do with the Underworld. Hades you beast. And poor, sweet, dear, precious <del>fefeta</del> Persephone.</li>
<li><strong>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Forsaken by Oliver Bowden</strong><br />
As soon as I realized that the library actually had Assassin&rsquo;s Creed books, I had to grab them! I&rsquo;ve heard about this book among the fandom and a lot of people love it. Mostly because Haytham is in it? Seeing as how it&rsquo;s a journal of pretty much his entire life, I was intrigued. I also can&rsquo;t bear to miss any piece of canon media.</li>
<li><strong>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Renaissance by Oliver Bowden</strong><br />
Saw this one right next to Forsaken. No regrets.</li>
<li><strong>Kimi Ni Todoke (Volumes 1-7) by Karuho Shiina</strong><br />
This series has been on my to-read list for the looongest time. It&rsquo;s almost been over three years, actually! I&rsquo;ve put it off because it&rsquo;s licensed in English (I know, I&rsquo;m horrible). As soon as I saw several volumes starting from the very beginning, I grabbed them all.</li>
<li><strong>Cirque du Freak (Volumes 8-12) by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai</strong><br />
Okay, I&rsquo;ve been reading this series for around two years. These are the final volumes. I just have to finish what I started!</li>
<li><strong>The Limit (Volumes 1 &amp; 2) by Keiko Suenobu</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m a big fan of Keiko Suenobu. I&rsquo;ve read most of her series, <em>Life</em> and a couple of her works. I&rsquo;ve always had a soft spot for over dramatic high school kids. On a more serious note, Suenobu loves to focus on bullying and I just love the awareness she&rsquo;s trying to spread. She&rsquo;s always a good read!</li>

          <p><p>I went to the library last Saturday! Quite fitting because it is reading week at university. I&rsquo;m probably the only one who takes the &ldquo;reading&rdquo; in reading week seriously&hellip; Anyway, here is my library haul this week in order of the books I remember first:</p>

<ul>
<li>French Milk by Lucy Knisley<br />
I&rsquo;m always a sucker for personal memoir-like graphic novels. The cover is just too charming to not want to read it!</li>
<li>Negima! (Volume 1) by Ken Akamatsu<br />
The name sounded familiar so I though, why not? I picked it up. Turns out Akamatsu is the mangaka for <em>Love Hina</em>. I predict boobs.</li>
<li>Pure by Timothy Mo<br />
Not going to lie, the cover is what did it for me. So pure.</li>
<li>I Shall Not Hate by Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish&rsquo;s<br />
Apparently this has been on my to read list for a while. I don&rsquo;t know how or why but it&rsquo;s been on there! So I finally decided to get it.</li>
<li>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle<br />
I&rsquo;ve been looking for a book I once read in elementary. This is a possible candidate for said book.</li>
<li>The Selector of Souls by Shauna Singh Baldwin<br />
My library was doing a blind date with a book thing. I thought it would be about tapestries. It&rsquo;s actually about India. Close enough.</li>
<li>Daughter of Xanadu by Dori Jones Yang<br />
Another one that&rsquo;s been on my to read list for a while.</li>
</ul>

<p>Books that I still need to add to the log:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moon Boy (Volume 4)</li>
<li>Moon Boy (Volume 5)</li>
<li>Josephine: A Life of the Empress</li>
<li>The Case for God</li>
<li>A whole load more of books&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently got back into reading online web comics&hellip; That was definitely not a good idea&hellip;</p>

          <p><p>I just woke up from a dream and I have to write about it. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s some kind of omen or just a representation of the current state of my mind, but either way, it spooked me pretty badly.</p>

<p>So I was at the train station, going up the stairs to reach the far end of the platform. The stations have walls that are on the sides of the tracks and they join together above the platform to make a ceiling.</p>

<p>As I descended down another set of stairs, my view shifted from first person to third person and I was viewing the station from the side. I saw myself and my friends standing at the middle of the platform but it was crowded so I suggested we move down to the end of the platform, where there wasn&rsquo;t that much of a crowd. I was back in my own body again and talking to my friends, my back towards the train tracks.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard the beeping sound of train doors closing and I turned around to see the train getting ready to leave. I saw a set of door closing and I tried to stick my hand through the narrowing gap to make it open but it was too late and I quickly withdrew my hand. I was angry that my friends didn&rsquo;t tell me the train came and shocked at how I didn&rsquo;t hear it approach.</p>

<p>When I looked back at my friends, I saw that they were no longer there and my family took their place instead.</p>

<p>We heard the trains coming again and looked eagerly towards the tracks. Usually there is only one set of tracks on both sides of the platform but suddenly there were three tracks on the side we were waiting for and well over five on the other side. The platform had shrunk to half the width of a sidewalk and everyone was teetering along the edge.</p>

<p>Another train came by but it ran along the farthest train track and was a freight train. Another freight train came by on the middle tracks. Finally a train came close to the platform but instead it was a private &ldquo;train&rdquo;. It looked like more of a car than anything, with an open hood. Two men had two tanks in the front seat and three off road vehicles in the second row of seats. My dad gave me papers that was in his hand and helped them take the items off the car/cart and the two men went off.</p>

<p>More trains came by on the other side. The tracks on the other side were chaotic and overlapped each other. Trains narrowly missed each other and an idiot driving a car on the tracks was nearly hit as well.</p>

<p>I looked down the platform. People were picking up their bags and leaving. With a worried look on my mothers face, she asked me for the time. I looked at my wrist watch and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quarter to 10, why?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t respond but instead looked off in the distance. I repeated the question until she answered me with, &ldquo;The trains stop running at 12:45.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even realize it was night already. She went on about maybe staying in a hotel for the night and as she did, I sent a text to my aunt in Vancouver explaining what had happened. It was at that moment that I knew that we were in the Philippines for vacation.</p>

<p>I was starting to say something but my mom shushed me when the sounds of an airplane filled our ears. It sounded extremely close, therefore extremely loud, and getting louder every second. I covered my ears thinking, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get hit, we&rsquo;re going to get hit&hellip;&rdquo; and braced myself for our impending doom. The sound abruptly stopped and for some reason, we were at ease.</p>

<p>We were the only ones on the platform now, give or take a person or two. I looked down the tracks and could see the night sky and the twinkling of office building lights and highways.</p>

<p>Suddenly a small airplane filled the view and it descended on the tracks, landing sideways. It scraped along the edge of the platform and against the wall. The wings were mostly torn off and we surprisingly didn&rsquo;t get hit. Another plane came right after it. And another.</p>

<p>Just when we thought it was safe, a large bus on it&rsquo;s side came speeding down the other side of the platform, barely missing us once more. A huge truck came rolling our way, tore through the ceiling, and landed right in front of my brother. I was sure it was going to kill us but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>We waited a couple of minutes and heard more crashes and explosions in the distance. The night skyline turned fiery.</p>

<p>Soon people started to come to the train station to pick up debris and helping any people in distress. It was morning, the sky was a clear blue, and the sun shone light on all of the damage from the night before.</p>

<p>I tried to persuade my mom that we should make a run for it but she said we needed to make eye contact with one of the volunteers. We tried calling help but no one came to our aid even though they were only a meter or two away from us.</p>

<p>I went so far as to lightly hit a woman walking by with the papers my dad handed me. She looked annoyed but said, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mom explained our situation to her in Tagalog and the lady called over the police and we descended onto the tracks. He asked for our passports. I pulled out my dad&rsquo;s passport from the papers and the police frowned because the cover was ripped and damaged but identified my dad anyway. My mom pulled out my brothers passport and he checked in with the police. My mom did the same with hers. But I couldn&rsquo;t find my passport. My mom told the police man that we must have lost it as we did lose our luggage. The police said nothing but wrote some things on to a notepad.</p>

<p>I took out my cell phone and saw that my aunt replied to our text. I don&rsquo;t remember what it said but it was not particularly helpful.</p>

<p>Then the police officer pulled out a fancy smart phone (my phone is a little ghetto Nokia) and showed that we had a video call. My mom said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s PJ!&rdquo; He is a family friend that we were planning to come to the Philippines with at the same time but decided against it. He was already in the Philippines before we got there and in the video call we saw that he and his family were at church, dressed fancy, laughing and smiling.</p>

<p>My mom tried to get their attention but all they did was wave at us and smile. She told me to show them what happened and I plucked the phone from the police&rsquo;s hand and faced the phone towards the wreckage. I gave it back to the police and he ended the call.</p>

<p>I leaned against the wall, pulled out my cell, and asked if I should text any of my aunts, uncles, or cousins in Canada. I listed all the ones that I had on my phone by name and my mom said no to each of them. That was when I woke up.</p>
