              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>One of the interns at my workplace suggested going painting as an activity that we could all do together. It seemed fun so we decided to give it a try! Paint Nite is a series of painting events held at bars, each session hosted by different people.</p>

<p>That day we went to <em>Yuk Yuk&rsquo;s Comedy Club</em> which is a few minutes walk from Victoria Park Stampede. We were really confused about the food since there was no (or incorrect) information on the website. The food there is actually pretty good but definitely not enough to fill you up. Take &ldquo;appetizers&rdquo; literally. We ordered chicken wings, potato skins,and nachos. The potato skins were absolutely delicious but only around 6 slices were made.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-676443656jpg.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-676443656jpg.jpg?resize=663%2C1179" alt="" class="wp-image-370 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The painting itself was a lot of fun! Our instructor that we had, Kim, was really patient, upbeat, and personable. She was certainly very energetic which I appreciated. Her instructions were extremely clear and I liked how she put a positive spin on everything.</p>

<p>What we were paitning was a moon looking over the ocean. It was fairly simple but we got the job done. This is was my painting ended up looking like at the end of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-419509144jpg.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-419509144jpg.jpg?resize=663%2C1179" alt="" class="wp-image-371 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>All in all, it was a lot of fun! I would definitely go for another day. It is a little bit pricy, $45CAD before tax not including the food and drinks. Coupons are readily available however but do save this for a special ocassion!</p>

                <li><a href="/categories/life">Life</a></li>            
                
    
                
              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>At the company where I&rsquo;m doing an internship right now offered all the interns the opportunity to go to their downtown location and give us a tour of all the art. It seems a little weird to give art tours in an office environment but once we stepped into the building, it made sense. There was art on every single floor of the building (of which there are over ten floors) and almost every single wall has a piece of art hanging on it.</p>

<p>The art collection is unique in that all the artists are Canadian or, at least, immigrants who have spent most of their lives in Canada (almost all of Canada is made up of immigrants anyway).</p>

<p>When I think of Canadian art, the first thing that comes to mind are landscapes. I honestly find that to be a little bit boring and winter scenes get a little tiresome after a while. There was definitely no lack of landscapes in this art collection but a lot of them resonated with me in a way that I didn&rsquo;t think they would.</p>

<p>Some of the paintings that I remember seeing off the top of my head are Christopher Pratt&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.exhibits.therooms.ca/ic_sites/pratt/art/showcase/drivtovenus.htm">Driving to Venus from Eddie&rsquo;s Cove East</a></em>, a couple of paintings from Jack Bush, a painting from Marion Nicoll, a lot of William Kurelek paintings, a fascinating Jean-Paul Riopelle painting, and much more.</p>

<p>The art curator definitely enhanced the experience. She was filled to the brim with knowledge and had something to say about each and every painting. I was honestly so entranced by her. Although she was an older woman, she seemed to be very youthful while remaining very serious. I think I fell in love for a little bit. She had a sort of energy that I appreciate.</p>

<p>After the art tour, us interns made our way to a drink and bowl bar. There wasn&rsquo;t another lane until 9pm so we opted to eat a little before heading downstairs to the bowling lane. And by &ldquo;a little&rdquo; I really mean a lot. I ordered fried chicken and biscuits because I was totally craving biscuits. The chicken were huge and I got three pieces of them. It was honestly delicious. I also bought mozza sticks which were amazing. Of course, drunk bowling isn&rsquo;t real drunk bowling without a couple of drinks. I got a orange ginger beer and an alcoholic strawberry lemonade drink. All very yummy.</p>

<p>Once we went downstairs, the bowling ensued. I haven&rsquo;t bowled in years. It was the first time I used the bigger bowling balls. They were so heavy that when I threw them, they slowly rolled down the lane.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a good and fun night. Honestly, the highlight was the art tour. It&rsquo;s nice to stop and appreciate creative works once in a while. I hope that I can put as much passion into my own career as these artists do.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I found myself in downtown with cancelled plans the other day. I didn&rsquo;t have to be home for another two hours so I decided to try a new coffee place. It was around five in the evening. I pulled up Google Maps and searched for coffee.</p>

<p>Scrolling through the list, I found that most of the coffee places closed at 5:00PM or 6:00PM. I needed a place to sit and blog hop for a little bit so that was no good. Even Starbucks closed pretty early!</p>

<p>From the list, I picked a couple of the coffee shops that were still open and just a 15 minute walk away from my current spot. When I went up to them, I discovered that they were actually closed for the day or closed for forever. Great.</p>

<p>In the end, I just went to the mall that had a Tim Hortons that was guaranteed to be open past 7pm. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t the vibe I wanted as it was crowded with strangely energetic construction workers who just ended the day but it did the job. I could sit down, drink some coffee, nibble on a donut, and comment on some blogs.</p>

<p>I wonder why some places close so early? I read somewhere that Calgary has a horrible night life and I just might have to agree. Downtown is honestly the last place I imagined to have places closing up early. In fact, I would have assumed the opposite!</p>

<p>My SO and I actually ran into similar problems during Valentine&rsquo;s Day. We didn&rsquo;t want to go to a restaurant but instead wanted to go do something. There were a couple of galleries we wanted to go to but they all close at 5:30pm. We would never make it there on time.</p>

<p>I know people want to go home to their loved ones at night but what about night owls like myself who want to put off going home but still enjoy a nice and quiet atmosphere? Okay, maybe I&rsquo;m asking for too much.</p>

          <p><p>In an attempt to do more things in my free time, I decided to join a gym. My original plan was to go to my university gym however since I am on co-op, I no longer have the discounted membership included in my tuition. Instead, I opted for my local Fit4Less. It is an extremely more convenient location, significantly cheaper, and a good &ldquo;introductory&rdquo; gym for those who are just starting out. An added bonus was having a friend who had a membership at the same gym so I had a gym buddy!</p>

<p>Today was my first day working out with him. He was a little late so I walked on a treadmill for around fifteen minutes. Once he arrived, we got on another cardio machine. I don&rsquo;t really know the name but we spent a good 30 minutes there talking about how life was going. I got a little out of breath but not really so maybe we weren&rsquo;t doing it right.</p>

<p>Afterwards we went on the lateral row machine. I could only do three sets of ten with 50lbs. A little concerning but I&rsquo;m really weak and I guess you gotta start somewhere!</p>

<p>It was just a quick session because it was getting late and the roads were pretty bad (half the office was working from home today). My mom was worried so we went home. It was a good solid hour spent there and we got to use the massage chairs at the end.</p>

<p>Hopefully we continue going!</p>

          <p><p>Last week&rsquo;s theme was fantasy. The original picture was a lot more ethereal and pretty. I had to redraw this one because I messed up the background. The background was definitely the hardest part because the original picture relied heavily on colour.</p>
