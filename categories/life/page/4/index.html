          <p><p>I took a little break during the month of May. My mental health was honestly at an all time low and I found myself having a hard time picking myself back up to get motivated to actually do things. Since I am around 6 months into my 22nd year of living, I thought it would be a good time to pause and reflect how I&rsquo;m doing with my 25 before 25. I only two and a half years left after all.</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong>: Good progress</p>

<p>I am on track with this, thankfully! So far I am passing all of my courses and seem to look good to graduate at the end of the year. I still need to register for one more course in September but I&rsquo;m having trouble finding a course that I am interested in that won&rsquo;t conflict with other courses.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents‚Äô house</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>My moving out fund is slowly getting chipped away due to paying for tuition. I still need a job secured for this summer. I really want to get one ASAP so I can get that cash flow going.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>When I was on internship, I put most of my paycheque into my TFSA. I still have a ways to go before maxing out my TFSA but I definitely have the funds in there. They will not be touched for a while.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open a RRSP account</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This won&rsquo;t happen until I get a semi-permanent job and I don&rsquo;t see that happening until I graduate. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This also won&rsquo;t happen until I graduate.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong>: Good progress</p>

<p>This year I have read around 36 books. There are still half a year left so I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m ahead of the game for this year.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong>: Little progress</p>

<p>I started playing The Witcher 3 and unfortunately, most of my gaming time has been spent on that. This has been a good reminder for me to boot up Origins sometime soon.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to code lately but I need to get started planning this seriously. Maybe I will dedicate this weekend to do so.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>As said before, haven&rsquo;t done a lot of coding this year. I also need to draw a good plan for this.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Woah, look at all these projects I haven&rsquo;t started on yet. I need to figure out which project to prioritize first. This website has been a long time coming but the TCG will be the most work. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver‚Äôs license</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Have yet to sit in the driver&rsquo;s seat yet this year. I have to check my learner&rsquo;s permit and see when it expires. I need a teacher and my poor father is reluctant to teach me because I am unsafe.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong>: Negligible progress</p>

<p>My mental health stumbling block last month has done a lot for me to trip up on this. I am struggling with making friends in general right now and I&rsquo;m finding it extremely hard. I started going to crochet meetups and will hopefully go regularly enough to make a friend or two.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>In May I felt like I regressed a lot but I am starting to go back to the gym. Yesterday I went to the gym on campus and my nerves only got me to do some cardio on the machines but I did something which was relieving.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Nope. Hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. Starting today.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water.</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>When I was sitting around at work, I was drinking a lot of water. Now back at school, I&rsquo;m finding it hard to remember to drink water. In fact, I&rsquo;m thirsty right now. I will go and get some water right now. Water break!</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong>: Little progress</p>

<p>My mom left the country to go the Philippines in May. I got some opportunities to cook. Just really small things. Made pizza, chicken wings, breakfast. Nothing hardcore.</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I need that cash first and foremost.</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This summer vacation, for sure.</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong>: Almost there</p>

<p>I got tipsy once so far. It was weird. Almost there. One day.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I kinda gave up my CCNA courses so I just might start to study on my own.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the start of summer so I will have to wait until winter comes back around to go to Zoo Lights.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>I am currently doing some counseling to combat this. Also taking part of an online cognitive behavioural therapy course. Exercise will hopefully help as well.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m such a bad pen pal. üôÅ Gah! I don&rsquo;t have a P.O. box anymore and I&rsquo;m not entirely comfortable not using one. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t seen any concerts that caught my eye yet. Wait, let me check right now. Nope, nothing catches my eye at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>I watched Ella Enchanted. That&rsquo;s one out of many, right?</p>

<p><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&rsquo;s question is&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you stop reading a book if an element of the plot strongly clashed with your personal beliefs, or would you continue reading until you finished the book?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would definitely finish the book. At least, that&rsquo;s what I think and hope I would do. As long as the book is good, I will keep on reading it. For example, I finished Jodi Picoult&rsquo;s <em>Songs of the Humpback Whale</em> although the personal choices of the characters did not fit in at all with my moral values. It definitely made me like the book and characters a lot less, unfortunately, but I did plow through to the end because the book was still good enough for me to want to know the rest of it.</p>

<p>Most books I read nowadays are either very recent or classics. It&rsquo;s easier for me to brush off elements that clash with my personal beliefs in classics because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just how it was back then.&rdquo; I still feel a slight offense but nine out of ten times, things are better now so there&rsquo;s also a feeling of relief.</p>

<p>In terms of modern stories, I think most instances where this happens, it&rsquo;s to demonstrate a positive message or to spread awareness.</p>

<p>So no, something must be very bad in order for me to drop the book.</p>

          <p><p>There&rsquo;s a cool hip place at the edge of Calgary&rsquo;s Chinatown and across Eau Claire Market called Cafe Blanca. They&rsquo;re most known for their Siphon coffee which I unfortunately did not remember to try. Instead, I ordered a plain normal latte and a cheesecake.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not cheesecake expert but I&rsquo;m definitely a cheesecake lover. I got myself a mint chocolate cheesecake. It was extremely delicious. It was a little more cake than I prefer (the base was an actual chocolate cake and yes, cake, not brownie) and not as much cheese as I&rsquo;d like. Still, very good.</p>

<p>I have a very love-hate relationship with lattes. Some lattes are great. All lattes will leave me with an upset stomach, which I somehow manage to forget every time I order one. This latte was simply okay. I don&rsquo;t really know what I would expect otherwise. But it was pretty good.</p>

<p>The actual space is great. The atmosphere is pretty chill. The tables are long and huge which is great for big groups or activities like paint night or Meetups. There&rsquo;s also spaces for individuals as well which are nice and isolated. I gotta give props for the music selection, I distinctly heard Joanna Wang playing at one point, <em>Wild World</em> is my guess.</p>

<p>My only hitch was I had no idea where to put my dirty dishes. I ended up putting it in a tub neear their counter. I hope that&rsquo;s the right place to put them. I even turned to Google Images for assistance on the layout of the place. But that part of my visit is just the social anxiety talking.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>One of the interns at my workplace suggested going painting as an activity that we could all do together. It seemed fun so we decided to give it a try! Paint Nite is a series of painting events held at bars, each session hosted by different people.</p>

<p>That day we went to <em>Yuk Yuk&rsquo;s Comedy Club</em> which is a few minutes walk from Victoria Park Stampede. We were really confused about the food since there was no (or incorrect) information on the website. The food there is actually pretty good but definitely not enough to fill you up. Take &ldquo;appetizers&rdquo; literally. We ordered chicken wings, potato skins,and nachos. The potato skins were absolutely delicious but only around 6 slices were made.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-676443656jpg.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-676443656jpg.jpg?resize=663%2C1179" alt="" class="wp-image-370 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The painting itself was a lot of fun! Our instructor that we had, Kim, was really patient, upbeat, and personable. She was certainly very energetic which I appreciated. Her instructions were extremely clear and I liked how she put a positive spin on everything.</p>

<p>What we were paitning was a moon looking over the ocean. It was fairly simple but we got the job done. This is was my painting ended up looking like at the end of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-419509144jpg.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-419509144jpg.jpg?resize=663%2C1179" alt="" class="wp-image-371 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>All in all, it was a lot of fun! I would definitely go for another day. It is a little bit pricy, $45CAD before tax not including the food and drinks. Coupons are readily available however but do save this for a special ocassion!</p>

          <p><p>My SO and I have been playing an MMO called Blade and Soul recently. We were optmistic about it running on my laptop because the requirements didn&rsquo;t seem too intensive and it even supported Windows 7.</p>

<p>It would crash at every single loading screen. Playing on the lowest settings in a 800&#215;600 window lowered the number of crashes greatly but the loading times were still absolutely ridiculous. I even managed to finish crocheting a bag while waiting for the game to load.</p>

<p>Every time the game would crash or I was doing something and mentioned my laptop being slow, my SO would ask me, &ldquo;When are you going to get a new laptop?&rdquo; I waffled a little bit on the subject. Gaming laptops cost quite a lot. However, it&rsquo;s still an investment. I imagined doing multitasking on a new laptop. I could run a VM, Visual Studio, a web browser, and maybe even a game at the same time.</p>

<p>My SO and I spent a couple of weeks looking at laptops and even PC builds. Obviously, I opted out of the PC build. I do want to build my own PC one day but my space is limited and funds are low. When I move out and have a stable job, that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ll take the time to build my own PC. For now, I&rsquo;m settling for a laptop.</p>

<p>This laptop was $100 or so discounted. It still cost around $1.3k, $1.5k including warranty (in my opinion, you&rsquo;d be crazy not buy something so expensive without warranty). I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good price for what I got.</p>

<p>The main (and pretty much only) criteria we were looking for was a good graphics card. I suggested laptops from the GTX 900 series as they were cheaper but in the end, the laptop I got was a GTX 1000 series graphics card. There were others things we looked at as well, like having up to date Bluetooth, an appropriate number of USB ports, and a good size that wouldn&rsquo;t be too heavy for me.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided on Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD. The 16GB RAM was an added bonus for me. It was $70 over my budget of $1.2k but it was worth the extra RAM.</p>

<p>I put in an order on Memory Express and picked it up the next day! There was a bit of a complication. My bank has a limit on the amount you can spend on one purchase so I had to call the bank to fix it. I also had to run back to work with a very heavy box since that took longer than I thought and I picked it up during my lunch break.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place and I set up the laptop. We oohed and aahed over the shiny laptop. So far, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it!</p>
