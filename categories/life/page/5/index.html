          </div>

          <p><p>One of the interns at my workplace suggested going painting as an activity that we could all do together. It seemed fun so we decided to give it a try! Paint Nite is a series of painting events held at bars, each session hosted by different people.</p>

<p>That day we went to <em>Yuk Yuk&rsquo;s Comedy Club</em> which is a few minutes walk from Victoria Park Stampede. We were really confused about the food since there was no (or incorrect) information on the website. The food there is actually pretty good but definitely not enough to fill you up. Take &ldquo;appetizers&rdquo; literally. We ordered chicken wings, potato skins,and nachos. The potato skins were absolutely delicious but only around 6 slices were made.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-676443656jpg.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-676443656jpg.jpg?resize=663%2C1179" alt="" class="wp-image-370 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The painting itself was a lot of fun! Our instructor that we had, Kim, was really patient, upbeat, and personable. She was certainly very energetic which I appreciated. Her instructions were extremely clear and I liked how she put a positive spin on everything.</p>

<p>What we were paitning was a moon looking over the ocean. It was fairly simple but we got the job done. This is was my painting ended up looking like at the end of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-419509144jpg.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/edelgrace.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-image-419509144jpg.jpg?resize=663%2C1179" alt="" class="wp-image-371 alignnone size-full"  data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>All in all, it was a lot of fun! I would definitely go for another day. It is a little bit pricy, $45CAD before tax not including the food and drinks. Coupons are readily available however but do save this for a special ocassion!</p>

          <p><p>My SO and I have been playing an MMO called Blade and Soul recently. We were optmistic about it running on my laptop because the requirements didn&rsquo;t seem too intensive and it even supported Windows 7.</p>

<p>It would crash at every single loading screen. Playing on the lowest settings in a 800&#215;600 window lowered the number of crashes greatly but the loading times were still absolutely ridiculous. I even managed to finish crocheting a bag while waiting for the game to load.</p>

<p>Every time the game would crash or I was doing something and mentioned my laptop being slow, my SO would ask me, &ldquo;When are you going to get a new laptop?&rdquo; I waffled a little bit on the subject. Gaming laptops cost quite a lot. However, it&rsquo;s still an investment. I imagined doing multitasking on a new laptop. I could run a VM, Visual Studio, a web browser, and maybe even a game at the same time.</p>

<p>My SO and I spent a couple of weeks looking at laptops and even PC builds. Obviously, I opted out of the PC build. I do want to build my own PC one day but my space is limited and funds are low. When I move out and have a stable job, that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ll take the time to build my own PC. For now, I&rsquo;m settling for a laptop.</p>

<p>This laptop was $100 or so discounted. It still cost around $1.3k, $1.5k including warranty (in my opinion, you&rsquo;d be crazy not buy something so expensive without warranty). I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good price for what I got.</p>

<p>The main (and pretty much only) criteria we were looking for was a good graphics card. I suggested laptops from the GTX 900 series as they were cheaper but in the end, the laptop I got was a GTX 1000 series graphics card. There were others things we looked at as well, like having up to date Bluetooth, an appropriate number of USB ports, and a good size that wouldn&rsquo;t be too heavy for me.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided on Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD. The 16GB RAM was an added bonus for me. It was $70 over my budget of $1.2k but it was worth the extra RAM.</p>

<p>I put in an order on Memory Express and picked it up the next day! There was a bit of a complication. My bank has a limit on the amount you can spend on one purchase so I had to call the bank to fix it. I also had to run back to work with a very heavy box since that took longer than I thought and I picked it up during my lunch break.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place and I set up the laptop. We oohed and aahed over the shiny laptop. So far, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it!</p>

          </div>

          <p><p>At the company where I&rsquo;m doing an internship right now offered all the interns the opportunity to go to their downtown location and give us a tour of all the art. It seems a little weird to give art tours in an office environment but once we stepped into the building, it made sense. There was art on every single floor of the building (of which there are over ten floors) and almost every single wall has a piece of art hanging on it.</p>

<p>The art collection is unique in that all the artists are Canadian or, at least, immigrants who have spent most of their lives in Canada (almost all of Canada is made up of immigrants anyway).</p>

<p>When I think of Canadian art, the first thing that comes to mind are landscapes. I honestly find that to be a little bit boring and winter scenes get a little tiresome after a while. There was definitely no lack of landscapes in this art collection but a lot of them resonated with me in a way that I didn&rsquo;t think they would.</p>

<p>Some of the paintings that I remember seeing off the top of my head are Christopher Pratt&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.exhibits.therooms.ca/ic_sites/pratt/art/showcase/drivtovenus.htm">Driving to Venus from Eddie&rsquo;s Cove East</a></em>, a couple of paintings from Jack Bush, a painting from Marion Nicoll, a lot of William Kurelek paintings, a fascinating Jean-Paul Riopelle painting, and much more.</p>

<p>The art curator definitely enhanced the experience. She was filled to the brim with knowledge and had something to say about each and every painting. I was honestly so entranced by her. Although she was an older woman, she seemed to be very youthful while remaining very serious. I think I fell in love for a little bit. She had a sort of energy that I appreciate.</p>

<p>After the art tour, us interns made our way to a drink and bowl bar. There wasn&rsquo;t another lane until 9pm so we opted to eat a little before heading downstairs to the bowling lane. And by &ldquo;a little&rdquo; I really mean a lot. I ordered fried chicken and biscuits because I was totally craving biscuits. The chicken were huge and I got three pieces of them. It was honestly delicious. I also bought mozza sticks which were amazing. Of course, drunk bowling isn&rsquo;t real drunk bowling without a couple of drinks. I got a orange ginger beer and an alcoholic strawberry lemonade drink. All very yummy.</p>

<p>Once we went downstairs, the bowling ensued. I haven&rsquo;t bowled in years. It was the first time I used the bigger bowling balls. They were so heavy that when I threw them, they slowly rolled down the lane.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a good and fun night. Honestly, the highlight was the art tour. It&rsquo;s nice to stop and appreciate creative works once in a while. I hope that I can put as much passion into my own career as these artists do.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I found myself in downtown with cancelled plans the other day. I didn&rsquo;t have to be home for another two hours so I decided to try a new coffee place. It was around five in the evening. I pulled up Google Maps and searched for coffee.</p>

<p>Scrolling through the list, I found that most of the coffee places closed at 5:00PM or 6:00PM. I needed a place to sit and blog hop for a little bit so that was no good. Even Starbucks closed pretty early!</p>

<p>From the list, I picked a couple of the coffee shops that were still open and just a 15 minute walk away from my current spot. When I went up to them, I discovered that they were actually closed for the day or closed for forever. Great.</p>

<p>In the end, I just went to the mall that had a Tim Hortons that was guaranteed to be open past 7pm. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t the vibe I wanted as it was crowded with strangely energetic construction workers who just ended the day but it did the job. I could sit down, drink some coffee, nibble on a donut, and comment on some blogs.</p>

<p>I wonder why some places close so early? I read somewhere that Calgary has a horrible night life and I just might have to agree. Downtown is honestly the last place I imagined to have places closing up early. In fact, I would have assumed the opposite!</p>

<p>My SO and I actually ran into similar problems during Valentine&rsquo;s Day. We didn&rsquo;t want to go to a restaurant but instead wanted to go do something. There were a couple of galleries we wanted to go to but they all close at 5:30pm. We would never make it there on time.</p>

<p>I know people want to go home to their loved ones at night but what about night owls like myself who want to put off going home but still enjoy a nice and quiet atmosphere? Okay, maybe I&rsquo;m asking for too much.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p><strong>Disclimer:</strong> This blog post does not give any advice.</p>

<p>What really irks me is when people say that those who are depressed don&rsquo;t deserve or shouldn&rsquo;t be in a relationship. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m depressed myself and in a relationship that it&rsquo;s a touchy subject for me.</p>

<p>However , I can see some of the reasoning. In my own experience, dealing with depression while being in a relationship has its own set of challenges.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I catch myself being stuck in my head and the other person falls off the radar. My lack of self care prevents me from being a better partner for my significant other. I get too wrapped up about how others might perceive and not the impact I have on others. Time I could spend improving myself is instead spent on staring at a blank ceiling contemplating my existence.</p>

<p>It really wasn&rsquo;t until yesterday that I came to this realization.</p>

<p>I told my SO the other day how lonely I felt, one of the sources of my depression. I started crying. I had never cried in front of him before. He held me tight and told me, &ldquo;You just need to find something to do with your time. Instead of crying, let&rsquo;s find you a hobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had already talked about going to social gatherings like board game nights and the such. He turned that down, saying it wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem. He suggested things like knitting or a programming project. At first, I was a little annoyed. I wanted to meet new people and make friends, not spend more time alone. But now I understand what he meant.</p>

<p>All this time, I wanted external validation. If I didn&rsquo;t fit in with a group of people or if I flubbed a conversation, it would weigh on my mind so heavily that it felt like the world was ending.</p>

<p>What I should having been doing is trying to find a way to be okay with myself. People will come and go and in the end, the only person that I will always have by my side is myself.</p>

<p>Now, I may or may not have reached this conclusion on my own. But if I weren&rsquo;t in a relationship with my SO at this point, I wouldn&rsquo;t have known <em>right now</em>. While he didn&rsquo;t spell everything out for me and instead put it in a gentler way, it did help me.</p>

<p>So I am really grateful that I&rsquo;m in a relationship, even if I am depressed.</p>
