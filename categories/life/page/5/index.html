              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p><strong>Disclimer:</strong> This blog post does not give any advice.</p>

<p>What really irks me is when people say that those who are depressed don&rsquo;t deserve or shouldn&rsquo;t be in a relationship. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m depressed myself and in a relationship that it&rsquo;s a touchy subject for me.</p>

<p>However , I can see some of the reasoning. In my own experience, dealing with depression while being in a relationship has its own set of challenges.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I catch myself being stuck in my head and the other person falls off the radar. My lack of self care prevents me from being a better partner for my significant other. I get too wrapped up about how others might perceive and not the impact I have on others. Time I could spend improving myself is instead spent on staring at a blank ceiling contemplating my existence.</p>

<p>It really wasn&rsquo;t until yesterday that I came to this realization.</p>

<p>I told my SO the other day how lonely I felt, one of the sources of my depression. I started crying. I had never cried in front of him before. He held me tight and told me, &ldquo;You just need to find something to do with your time. Instead of crying, let&rsquo;s find you a hobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had already talked about going to social gatherings like board game nights and the such. He turned that down, saying it wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem. He suggested things like knitting or a programming project. At first, I was a little annoyed. I wanted to meet new people and make friends, not spend more time alone. But now I understand what he meant.</p>

<p>All this time, I wanted external validation. If I didn&rsquo;t fit in with a group of people or if I flubbed a conversation, it would weigh on my mind so heavily that it felt like the world was ending.</p>

<p>What I should having been doing is trying to find a way to be okay with myself. People will come and go and in the end, the only person that I will always have by my side is myself.</p>

<p>Now, I may or may not have reached this conclusion on my own. But if I weren&rsquo;t in a relationship with my SO at this point, I wouldn&rsquo;t have known <em>right now</em>. While he didn&rsquo;t spell everything out for me and instead put it in a gentler way, it did help me.</p>

<p>So I am really grateful that I&rsquo;m in a relationship, even if I am depressed.</p>

          <p><p>In an attempt to do more things in my free time, I decided to join a gym. My original plan was to go to my university gym however since I am on co-op, I no longer have the discounted membership included in my tuition. Instead, I opted for my local Fit4Less. It is an extremely more convenient location, significantly cheaper, and a good &ldquo;introductory&rdquo; gym for those who are just starting out. An added bonus was having a friend who had a membership at the same gym so I had a gym buddy!</p>

<p>Today was my first day working out with him. He was a little late so I walked on a treadmill for around fifteen minutes. Once he arrived, we got on another cardio machine. I don&rsquo;t really know the name but we spent a good 30 minutes there talking about how life was going. I got a little out of breath but not really so maybe we weren&rsquo;t doing it right.</p>

<p>Afterwards we went on the lateral row machine. I could only do three sets of ten with 50lbs. A little concerning but I&rsquo;m really weak and I guess you gotta start somewhere!</p>

<p>It was just a quick session because it was getting late and the roads were pretty bad (half the office was working from home today). My mom was worried so we went home. It was a good solid hour spent there and we got to use the massage chairs at the end.</p>

<p>Hopefully we continue going!</p>

          <p><p>I decided to post a work in progress. My SO picked this week&rsquo;s picture and it was of a very pretty warrior girl. I started it and I really like how the face turned out. I quickly sketched out the rest of the body and I am already pretty proud of it. Compared to the original, my version looks a little less feminine. I just can&rsquo;t draw lips right from the side. Also, her eyebrows are so &ldquo;on fleek&rdquo; that I don&rsquo;t dare to change them. So much character in those eyebrows.</p>

          <p><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling pretty down in the dumps. Ever since I started working, I realized that I have a lot of free time that I don&rsquo;t know what to do with. I even started to (I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m saying this) miss having homework. Okay, I actually have a lot of projects that I want to get working on but I also want to be a little more social.</p>

<p>My SO had been talking about his ventures in bouldering and going out with his friends. I started to feel a little envious. Truthfully, I only have one friend outside of my SO and our schedules are so out of sync that I can only see her a couple times a year. So my SO and I ended up looking for hobbies that I could get into, but also with a social aspect.</p>

<p>I entertained the idea of joining a club on campus but since my work is pretty far from campus and I also live far from campus, I decided it might now be the best idea. I did, however, find a couple of clubs that I would like to join for when I go back to school.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we found a couple of groups on&nbsp;<a href="http://meetup.com/" style="font-size: 16px;">Meetup.com</a>. There were a lot that I had to sift through. Some of them I was interested in but the group was dead. Others were so popular that their events required wait lists. I ultimately narrowed them done to a couple of groups that I would like to try out.</p>

<p><strong>Board Games for Women</strong></p>

<p>I always wanted to get into board games and make more female friends. Being in a male dominated major, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of opportunities to meet other women.</p>

<p><strong>Arts and Crafts</strong></p>

<p>When I was younger, I was a very crafty person. One of my elementary teachers once noted that I was &ldquo;always making something.&rdquo; Not much has changed except for the fact that my creative pursuits are now digital. I would love to get in touch with the more physical side of creating things again.</p>

<p><strong>Big Data Programming</strong></p>

<p>I find the concept of big data to be incredibly interesting. I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of programming as of late but it would be a great idea to get involved. Their meetups are a little sporadic but hopefully they have an event soon.</p>

          <p><p>I chose last week&rsquo;s picture this time. I thought the picture of the duck statues wearing the kitty hats from the Women&rsquo;s March was pretty cute and easy to do as well. It wasn&rsquo;t that easy, unfortunately. I didn&rsquo;t finish the sidewalk. Didn&rsquo;t want to draw all those stones. My SO didn&rsquo;t manage to get very far with it either unfortunately. But it was fun to draw!</p>
