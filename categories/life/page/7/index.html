          <p><p>This week my SO and I decided to draw a bear. Er, rather, we decided to draw two bears! The picture we found was simply just a quick Google search. It was a rather cute picture! I kinda struggled with this one since bears are really fluffy while the previous week&rsquo;s elephant had very simple lines.</p>

          <p><p>Yesterday I went out with my SO for Vietnamese food. There&rsquo;s a decently sized restaurant called <em>Bow River Vietnamese Restaurant</em> that&rsquo;s close by his house. I regret not taking pictures but their deep fried wontons were delicious. It had a good amount of meat and perfect crunchy crust. The sauce they provided it with was good as well.</p>

<p>For myself, I ordered a regular beef noodle soup. In the soup was tripe, brisket, and beef balls in it. The broth was great. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of tripe so I left it in the bowl. The bowl itself was pretty big, I can&rsquo;t believe I almost finished everything. I feel bad for wasting food but there&rsquo;s just so much that they give! For drinks, I got an orange slush. Orange is my favourite drink flavour of all time and I was not disappointed. It tasted like the artificial orange flavour but any kind of orange is okay with me.</p>

<p>The side they have are interesting, bean sprouts and a sprig of mint. SO ate most of the bean sprouts and I regret not eating more of the mint. It was tasty, for a leaf. Weird to think about how mints are essentially just plants.</p>

<p>While at his house, we watched a couple episodes of <em>Westworld</em>. If you haven&rsquo;t heard yet, it&rsquo;s a TV series about a highly advanced them park that features extremely advanced and realistic AIs that roam around interacting with the humans and attending their every needs (or should I say, wants). We&rsquo;re only at the fourth episode right now. I&rsquo;m intrigued with it although it&rsquo;s hard for me to figure what is really happening at any point in time. When I expressed my confusing, my SO tried to give me a hint that didn&rsquo;t reveal any spoilers (disclaimer, skip the rest of the paragraph if you&rsquo;re sensitive to spoilers). He told me that there are three distinct timelines in the story. This may have confused me further. I did notice the three different plots: rich old man&rsquo;s attempt to discover the secrets of the park, William on his first adventures in the park, Maeve&rsquo;s discovery that things aren&rsquo;t not what it seems in the park. I&rsquo;m having trouble trying to place when each of these plots happen relative to each other. All the other events that happen in the series, I have trouble placing what happens where.</p>

<p>So far though, I enjoy the series. I doubted the fact that is was a Western (I&rsquo;m not a really a fan of Westerns) but I was pleased when it was much more than a Western. The sci-fi element is always present in the story and you&rsquo;re always aware that everything is not &ldquo;real.&rdquo; I accidentally spoiled myself looking up pictures of Thandie Newton (she is superb, I loved her in <em>Pursuit of Happyness</em>) but it only fueled my anticipation to go through the rest of the series. My SO had already watched the series and is going through watching it again with me (bless). He wasn&rsquo;t entirely enamored with the series but I guess he likes it enough to go through a second watching.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I helped him move desks. There&rsquo;s a desk in the living room that he wanted to transfer into his little &ldquo;office&rdquo; room. His previous desk was a little small and the desk he moved in was much larger and provided more space. The surface area is definitely greater but sitting two people at that desk gets a bit cramped. I do like seeing his desk somewhat tidier though, although it is still kinda dusty.</p>

<p>After that I walked to Safeway to get some Starbucks. I received a gift card from one of my relatives. I love Starbucks. I only like the sugary drinks and I don&rsquo;t like to drink my coffee black. This time I ordered a grande caramel machiatto. It was sweet enough for me, although all the caramel drizzle may have been a bit overkill. But I enjoyed drinking it. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time I drank it but the first time in a while. I may buy it again, sometimes I have not encountered a drink yet to replace my ultimate favourite: white chocolate mocha.</p>

<p>Anyway, once I got home, I ate dinner and wrote up this blog post! It&rsquo;s now almost 8:30PM. I think I will spend the rest of the day studying for CCNA. Hopefully I can finish the rest of the chapter.</p>

          <p><p>My SO suggested we start a weekly drawing. So we pick a picture of something to draw and at the end of the week we share it. Last week we drew elephants.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Here&rsquo;s my elephant! I think I&rsquo;m going to stick to pencil drawings. I&rsquo;m not good at drawing by any means and this was pretty easy, honestly. It was fun drawing it though!</span></p>

<p>Versus what I was trying to draw&#8230; I see clearly what I should have done differently now, haha.</p>

          <p><p>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&rsquo;s network&#8230; Kinda rough.</p>

<p>However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently doing an inventory of our gear and before I left for holidays, I was labelling items that needed to be recycled or sold. Apparently some of the labels fell off so I reinforced them all with tape. Since I was gone for two weeks, there were a couple of new devices in our inventory so I took note of those as well.</p>

<p>Some of the devices are strewn about the place with no order so I attempted to move some of them into groups of device types. For example, some of the supervisor engines were mixed with the switches when there was a shelf dedicated solely for engines.</p>

<p>We use bins to store smaller items. Some of the bins didn&rsquo;t have any labels so I had to make some in order for people to know where everything is. I also labelled some ambiguos boxes. It&rsquo;s a big guessing game looking at them all.</p>

<p>I received a package from Meraki containing a Meraki access point. Pretty cool! I thought that maybe I needed to do something with it for work so I read the manual but it turned out that it&rsquo;s mine to keep. It&rsquo;s super sleek.</p>

<p>In my co-op, I have to hand in reports in order to get credit. One of the first things I have to hand in during the start of the work term is learning objectives. I spent a good amount of time trying to think up of what I wanted to accomplish during this work term. I&rsquo;m still pretty undecided as I don&rsquo;t want to repeat myself from last term&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place. While he played Vermintide with friends, I continued reading <em>Buried in Books</em> by Julie Rugg. Basically it&rsquo;s a collection of quotes regarding books and reading. I love reading books about books and reading. What Ilove more is reading a book about books that are about books and reading.</p>

<p>After that we settled in for some quiet time to work on a puzzle I bought him for Christmas. It&rsquo;s a big 1000 piece puzzle of a volcano. I chose it because it was cool and dramatic and it was more than two colours. I guess some people like the challenge of putting together a puzzle of the ocean and the sky but not us.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my day in a nutshell. A very chill and relaxing day. Now I&rsquo;m hoping to tinker with the access point I received, work out a little, and study a bit for my CCNA before I hit the hay.</p>
