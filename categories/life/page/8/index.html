          <p><p>New Years Resolutions are no longer the in thing. I recently turned 22 and it feels like my life is whizzing by now. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my goals but there are just too many that I have for one year and a couple that will go beyond 2017. So I figured a 25 before 25 would be appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in university since I was 17. Five years later and I&rsquo;m still here. While I do love the academic environment, I seriously can&rsquo;t wait to graduate. It&rsquo;s about time that I move on from school, even if it&rsquo;s a little scary.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents&rsquo; house</strong></p>

<p>It was only until recently that I resolved to move out and move out for good. When I was young, I happily accepted the fact that my parents would like to live with me in their retirement. Not anymore. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about myself and my boundaries towards my parents. I think it would be best for all of us for me to move out.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest steps towards responsible personal finance is maxing out my tax free savings account. As of 2016, my total contribution limit is around 30k. As the years go by, that will only increase. Hopefully I can do it.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open a RRSP account</strong></p>

<p>The only reason why I don&rsquo;t have one yet is because I don&rsquo;t have a permanent job yet. I simply don&rsquo;t make enough to warrant an RRSP. However, if I want to retire gracefully, an RRSP is essential.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong></p>

<p>Every graduates worst nightmare is to leave university only to land a part time job at the grocery store. I&rsquo;m hoping to land a job in networking or program development. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be right away, I can stand working retail for a couple of months.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong></p>

<p>Every year I want to read at least 50 books. I&rsquo;m an avid reader. This year I managed to make it work so I&rsquo;m hoping I can continue to make it work for the next couple of years.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong></p>

<p>One of my friends joke that I&rsquo;ve been playing the first installation of Dragon Age for years. So far I&rsquo;ve clocked around 100 hours and I&rsquo;m definitely nowhere near done it yet. It&rsquo;s those side quests that sidetrack me, I swear.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong></p>

<p>A couple of years ago I started working on a TCG but it fell through the cracks. I&rsquo;d love to take up that project again and finish it. I love TCGs so it would be a fun endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday I started making a small Pomodoro app. I&rsquo;m making decent progress but it&rsquo;s nowhere near polished. It would be great to finish it.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong></p>

<p>Another project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for a while. I keep starting and restarting it. I don&rsquo;t want to rely on GoodReads and I fancy the idea of having a local copy of the books I&rsquo;ve read.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver&rsquo;s license</strong></p>

<p>22 and without a license. I feel like a burden asking my friends for rides everywhere. I do like walking around everywhere because I desperately need the exercise. However, the city I live in is not really commuter friendly so a car would make things extremely easier.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong></p>

<p>Many of my friends are alike in that we are all tech geeks. From gaming to building PCs to programming, you name it. I think it would be nice to make friends who aren&rsquo;t necessarily into the whole tech thing. Different perspectives is essential for a well-rounded world view. Plus, I&rsquo;d like to be introduced into something that isn&rsquo;t, well, tech.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong></p>

<p>I envy those who can lift and run and be athletic. I&rsquo;d really love to lose some weight, cut down on the body fat, and not be struggling for air after walking three flights of stairs.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong></p>

<p>My dentist always begs me to floss but no matter how many horror stories she gives me, I just don&rsquo;t do it. I know I should. I really have to.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m dehydrated <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. I&rsquo;m convinced that I have years shaved off my life purely due to the fact that I do not drink enough water. I don&rsquo;t notice my thirst cues very well until my head is throbbing, my lips a cracked, and my throat is parched. Dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong></p>

<p>If I want to move out, I should probably learn how to cook. And not just making sandwiches. I&rsquo;d love to be able to make pasta.</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled to another country without family once but it was a school field trip. I would love to go to Japan but that&rsquo;s expensive. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just cross the border down south again?</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong></p>

<p>I started the Konmari process but have yet to progress past my books. It would be beneficial to accomplish this before I move out. Less stuff to pack!</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong></p>

<p>I had my first alcoholic beverage this year. I&rsquo;ve never been black out drunk before and I think there should be a first time for everything. Hopefully I don&rsquo;t spiral from there.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through my CCNA course so getting my CCNA is totally on the horizon.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong></p>

<p>Zoo Lights is a local festival that happens every winter. I&rsquo;ve never gone before because my parents have been paranoid about my being out in the cold at night. I think it would make for a good future date.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong></p>

<p>Oof, it got heavy suddenly. I&rsquo;ve been struggling with depression for a couple of years now. I think I&rsquo;ve identified some sources and I&rsquo;d like to come up with a plan to combat it.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong></p>

<p>I have a pen pal whom I haven&rsquo;t written to in months. Well, I sent him a quick Christmas card but that doesn&rsquo;t count in my opinion. I&rsquo;d love to pick up the pen again as I do miss his correspondences!</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been to a concert since my very first concert (My Chemical Romance, RIP). I have a couple of bands and artists that I&rsquo;d love to see live but it&rsquo;s just a matter of if they come to Calgary! But it would totally be cool to take a road trip outside of the city to watch some live music.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong></p>

<p>There are too many movies that I have not seen before. Just to name a few: V for Vendetta, Clueless, Pulp Fiction, Schindler&rsquo;s List, Singing in the Rain, Princess Mononoke, Gone Girl, Akira, The Princess Bride&#8230;</p>

          <p><p>Yesterday I celebrated my 22nd birthday.</p>

<p>Every year we go to mass on my birthday in the morning as a family. This year my dad was working but my little cousin was with us because we were babysitting him so that was okay. Every year the homily is about the same. My birthday falls on the feast day of the Holy Family. So the homily is usually about obeying and honouring your parents; how Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were the perfect family; and so on. It kinda gets boring after a while.</p>

<p>After that I went over to my SO&rsquo;s house to chill for a bit before we headed out for lunch. We had to wait for his brother to come over to watch the house before we left.</p>

<p>For lunch I met a couple of friends at a vegan restaurant downtown called The Coup. I regret not taking picures but it was a nice and cozy place with extremely friendly servers. The food was definitely different as you might expect from a vegan place. One of my friends ordered a London Fog and it came with the tea strainer place on top of the cup. It was very fancy. The food was delicious as well. I ordered a hot pot that was deliciously creamy and filled to the brim with, you guessed it, veggies. No complaints here though, it was amazing.</p>

<p>The discussions while we were eating was pretty typical as I&rsquo;d expect from a bunch of nerds like us. Talked a bit about programming languages that don&rsquo;t have variable typing, Magic tournaments (I know nothing about Magic), shenanigans that happen in Physics club (I am not part of the physics club), anime, etc. I had a fun time and since I see my friends so rarely it was a nice treat.</p>

<p>Afterwards my SO and I got driven back to his place. We watched a bit of Warhammer: Vermintide character analysis videos on YouTube (I don&rsquo;t play that game). Then I had to go home, which wasn&rsquo;t all that bad since family was waiting for me.</p>

<p>My little cousin and my brother were playing video games, as always. My cousin had been playing Pokemon on my 3DS nonstop. At least my Pokemon are all trained now. I will admit, I did take a nap. When I woke up my aunt and uncle were there as well as my uncle&rsquo;s nephew. I groggily sat up and watched my brother play the video game I bought him for Christmas.</p>

<p>Once everyone was here, we ate. I ate a bunch of chips, spaghetti, lumpia, turkey, and some veggies. The cake I bought was cheesecake so I ate some of that too.</p>

<p>Eventually my cousins left and the parents were all that remained. They mostly drank and talked amongst themselves while my brother and I were absorbed in <em>Saints Row the Third</em>. Of course, they left eventually too. After a quick prayer we all went to bed.</p>

<p>I think I had a pretty good birthday. It&rsquo;s always nice to be surrounded by friends, family, and good food.</p>

          </div>

          <p><p>Over the weekend I had eaten two plates piled high with sweet American-Chinese prepared meats, a plate full of sweet desserts, and a take-out box of homemade cookies. On Friday I almost consumed an entire bag of buttery popcorn but the bag spilled into the aisle as it descended up the movie theatre steps. As I heard the small popped kernels tumble out of the bag, I felt both relief and disappointment. I was looking forward to eating the buttery goodness the moment I received the free movie tickets as a gift. Going to the movies was an excellent excuse to gorge on popcorn. But I also felt relieved at the amount of calories that didn&rsquo;t pass through my mouth. The next day, however, I walked into the grocery store and bought a box of microwaveable popcorn. My justification was that I would have eaten the popcorn eventually anyway.</p>

<p>So Sunday night I tried hard not to think about all the energy I consumed and how little I exerted. Well, I walked over 10k steps on Friday from window shopping. But it still wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>I made a resolution to myself: new week, new me. I will definitely cut down on my food consumption.</p>

<p>On Monday I grabbed a bag of chips from the vending machine. I had no idea what kind of flavour &ldquo;Au Gratin&rdquo; was but it looked good. The cheesy taste was too overpowering. To drown out the taste I got another bag of chips and a chocolate bar.</p>

<p>Tuesday I baked three cheesecakes. I only intend to eat one and giveaway three but I accidently used 1 cup of sugar instead of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup.</p>

<p>Today I went out for lunch at Tim Hortons. A toasted plain bagel with cream cheese and a cafe mocha. Not too bad but I also plan on eating that cheesecake later today.</p>

<p>New month, new me, probably.</p>

<h3 id="day-27-total-body">Day 27: Total Body</h3>

<p>Today is the last day of the beginner&rsquo;s workout calendar, not including the rest day tomorrow! I think I&rsquo;ll make a blog post the day after rest day to talk about how the month went. As for today, today was a lot of sweat and groaning! A lot of cardio today, even if it isn&rsquo;t intensive.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-burning-ladder-for-toned-thighs-and-abs">Video 1: Fat Burning Ladder for Toned Thighs and Abs</h3>

<p>There is a couple of basic moves done in 45, 30, and 20 second bursts. Thankfully, the moves are pretty doable. The only time I paused was when I had to position my laptop to see the screen properly between moves.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Froggy Hop:</em> I did the beginner&rsquo;s version of this move, solely because I didn&rsquo;t want to wake up my dad downstairs. This is the least intensive move in this video.</li>
<li><em>Push Up Plank:</em> I hate these so much!!! Halfway through, I had to switch from the advanced to beginner&rsquo;s version. Push ups are not my area of expertise.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Lunge:</em> I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because of yesterday&rsquo;s workout, but I felt actual pain doing these. I don&rsquo;t even remember what yesterday&rsquo;s workout was and if there were a lot of thighs involved&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross Abs:</em> I&rsquo;m starting to love and hate this move. There is a lot of this move in today&rsquo;s workout.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-flat-belly-fat-burner">Video 2: Flat Belly Fat Burner</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>In and Out:</em> I just did froggy hop beginner&rsquo;s version as to not wake up my dad, yet again.</li>
<li><em>Roll Ups:</em> This is my favourite move of all time. It&rsquo;s fun doing them fast. I still can&rsquo;t do them without lifting up my legs but my feet are little a little lower each time.</li>
<li><em>Surfers:</em> This is another move I had to modify to be quieter. I just kind of stepped on one leg and spun around fast.</li>
<li><em>Triple Crunch:</em> I really don&rsquo;t know how to do crunches without straining my neck. In fact, it just feels like I&rsquo;m straining my neck!</li>
<li><em>Burpees:</em> Yet another move I had to modify. I did the silent burpees plus a mini push up.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lifts:</em> I tried really hard to focus on my abs with this move. I definitely felt it.</li>
<li><em>Football Runs:</em> Good thing this move focuses on light feet because I really did not want to wake my dad up.</li>
<li><em>Eagle Abs:</em> how do I do these properly? I&rsquo;m doing them in a way that I really feel my abs but I&rsquo;m sure that if someone watched me and then watched Cassey, they would laugh at me, haha!</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross Abs:</em> There is around 2-3 minutes of this move&#8230; It&rsquo;s so hard to do for such a long time! Cassey does add some variation but of course, it&rsquo;s to challenge us and not to make it monotonous.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still debating whether or not I want a &ldquo;booty&rdquo; or not. I did the video anyway.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Cross Butt Lift:</em> This move is really interesting&#8230; I could feel the burn through the entire thing. I also did not do it properly because I just could not make my knee touch the floor.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> When I first tried this move, it was pretty easy but in this video, after those cross butt lifts, my butt was on fire! Ironic, considering the name of the move, haha.</li>
<li><em>Heel Lift:</em> Oh my legs! And more importantly, oh my butt&#8230; The pulses are torturous.</li>
