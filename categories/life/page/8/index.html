          <p><p>Yesterday I celebrated my 22nd birthday.</p>

<p>Every year we go to mass on my birthday in the morning as a family. This year my dad was working but my little cousin was with us because we were babysitting him so that was okay. Every year the homily is about the same. My birthday falls on the feast day of the Holy Family. So the homily is usually about obeying and honouring your parents; how Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were the perfect family; and so on. It kinda gets boring after a while.</p>

<p>After that I went over to my SO&rsquo;s house to chill for a bit before we headed out for lunch. We had to wait for his brother to come over to watch the house before we left.</p>

<p>For lunch I met a couple of friends at a vegan restaurant downtown called The Coup. I regret not taking picures but it was a nice and cozy place with extremely friendly servers. The food was definitely different as you might expect from a vegan place. One of my friends ordered a London Fog and it came with the tea strainer place on top of the cup. It was very fancy. The food was delicious as well. I ordered a hot pot that was deliciously creamy and filled to the brim with, you guessed it, veggies. No complaints here though, it was amazing.</p>

<p>The discussions while we were eating was pretty typical as I&rsquo;d expect from a bunch of nerds like us. Talked a bit about programming languages that don&rsquo;t have variable typing, Magic tournaments (I know nothing about Magic), shenanigans that happen in Physics club (I am not part of the physics club), anime, etc. I had a fun time and since I see my friends so rarely it was a nice treat.</p>

<p>Afterwards my SO and I got driven back to his place. We watched a bit of Warhammer: Vermintide character analysis videos on YouTube (I don&rsquo;t play that game). Then I had to go home, which wasn&rsquo;t all that bad since family was waiting for me.</p>

<p>My little cousin and my brother were playing video games, as always. My cousin had been playing Pokemon on my 3DS nonstop. At least my Pokemon are all trained now. I will admit, I did take a nap. When I woke up my aunt and uncle were there as well as my uncle&rsquo;s nephew. I groggily sat up and watched my brother play the video game I bought him for Christmas.</p>

<p>Once everyone was here, we ate. I ate a bunch of chips, spaghetti, lumpia, turkey, and some veggies. The cake I bought was cheesecake so I ate some of that too.</p>

<p>Eventually my cousins left and the parents were all that remained. They mostly drank and talked amongst themselves while my brother and I were absorbed in <em>Saints Row the Third</em>. Of course, they left eventually too. After a quick prayer we all went to bed.</p>

<p>I think I had a pretty good birthday. It&rsquo;s always nice to be surrounded by friends, family, and good food.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Over the weekend I had eaten two plates piled high with sweet American-Chinese prepared meats, a plate full of sweet desserts, and a take-out box of homemade cookies. On Friday I almost consumed an entire bag of buttery popcorn but the bag spilled into the aisle as it descended up the movie theatre steps. As I heard the small popped kernels tumble out of the bag, I felt both relief and disappointment. I was looking forward to eating the buttery goodness the moment I received the free movie tickets as a gift. Going to the movies was an excellent excuse to gorge on popcorn. But I also felt relieved at the amount of calories that didn&rsquo;t pass through my mouth. The next day, however, I walked into the grocery store and bought a box of microwaveable popcorn. My justification was that I would have eaten the popcorn eventually anyway.</p>

<p>So Sunday night I tried hard not to think about all the energy I consumed and how little I exerted. Well, I walked over 10k steps on Friday from window shopping. But it still wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>I made a resolution to myself: new week, new me. I will definitely cut down on my food consumption.</p>

<p>On Monday I grabbed a bag of chips from the vending machine. I had no idea what kind of flavour &ldquo;Au Gratin&rdquo; was but it looked good. The cheesy taste was too overpowering. To drown out the taste I got another bag of chips and a chocolate bar.</p>

<p>Tuesday I baked three cheesecakes. I only intend to eat one and giveaway three but I accidently used 1 cup of sugar instead of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup.</p>

<p>Today I went out for lunch at Tim Hortons. A toasted plain bagel with cream cheese and a cafe mocha. Not too bad but I also plan on eating that cheesecake later today.</p>

<p>New month, new me, probably.</p>

<h3 id="day-27-total-body">Day 27: Total Body</h3>

<p>Today is the last day of the beginner&rsquo;s workout calendar, not including the rest day tomorrow! I think I&rsquo;ll make a blog post the day after rest day to talk about how the month went. As for today, today was a lot of sweat and groaning! A lot of cardio today, even if it isn&rsquo;t intensive.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-burning-ladder-for-toned-thighs-and-abs">Video 1: Fat Burning Ladder for Toned Thighs and Abs</h3>

<p>There is a couple of basic moves done in 45, 30, and 20 second bursts. Thankfully, the moves are pretty doable. The only time I paused was when I had to position my laptop to see the screen properly between moves.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Froggy Hop:</em> I did the beginner&rsquo;s version of this move, solely because I didn&rsquo;t want to wake up my dad downstairs. This is the least intensive move in this video.</li>
<li><em>Push Up Plank:</em> I hate these so much!!! Halfway through, I had to switch from the advanced to beginner&rsquo;s version. Push ups are not my area of expertise.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Lunge:</em> I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because of yesterday&rsquo;s workout, but I felt actual pain doing these. I don&rsquo;t even remember what yesterday&rsquo;s workout was and if there were a lot of thighs involved&#8230;</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross Abs:</em> I&rsquo;m starting to love and hate this move. There is a lot of this move in today&rsquo;s workout.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-flat-belly-fat-burner">Video 2: Flat Belly Fat Burner</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>In and Out:</em> I just did froggy hop beginner&rsquo;s version as to not wake up my dad, yet again.</li>
<li><em>Roll Ups:</em> This is my favourite move of all time. It&rsquo;s fun doing them fast. I still can&rsquo;t do them without lifting up my legs but my feet are little a little lower each time.</li>
<li><em>Surfers:</em> This is another move I had to modify to be quieter. I just kind of stepped on one leg and spun around fast.</li>
<li><em>Triple Crunch:</em> I really don&rsquo;t know how to do crunches without straining my neck. In fact, it just feels like I&rsquo;m straining my neck!</li>
<li><em>Burpees:</em> Yet another move I had to modify. I did the silent burpees plus a mini push up.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lifts:</em> I tried really hard to focus on my abs with this move. I definitely felt it.</li>
<li><em>Football Runs:</em> Good thing this move focuses on light feet because I really did not want to wake my dad up.</li>
<li><em>Eagle Abs:</em> how do I do these properly? I&rsquo;m doing them in a way that I really feel my abs but I&rsquo;m sure that if someone watched me and then watched Cassey, they would laugh at me, haha!</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross Abs:</em> There is around 2-3 minutes of this move&#8230; It&rsquo;s so hard to do for such a long time! Cassey does add some variation but of course, it&rsquo;s to challenge us and not to make it monotonous.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-6-minutes-to-a-sexy-booty">Video 3: 6 Minutes to a Sexy Booty</h3>

<p>Still debating whether or not I want a &ldquo;booty&rdquo; or not. I did the video anyway.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Cross Butt Lift:</em> This move is really interesting&#8230; I could feel the burn through the entire thing. I also did not do it properly because I just could not make my knee touch the floor.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> When I first tried this move, it was pretty easy but in this video, after those cross butt lifts, my butt was on fire! Ironic, considering the name of the move, haha.</li>
<li><em>Heel Lift:</em> Oh my legs! And more importantly, oh my butt&#8230; The pulses are torturous.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember anymore but I think I&rsquo;ve done this video before. This video is really simple, there is just one move: the candlestick. I think I was doing it properly this time because I started to get tired and I could feel burning in my limbs and my core (I can&rsquo;t be as technical as Cassey, what are my obliques????).</p>

<h3 id="video-3-feel-good-soul-stretches">Video 3: Feel Good Soul Stretches</h3>

<p>Feel good soul stretches is a fitting title for this video. There are a lot of lunge stretches in this video, which I&rsquo;m not complaining about. I found that I&rsquo;m not very great with balance but I&rsquo;m pleased to say I didn&rsquo;t fall over once! That stretch was very much needed.</p>
