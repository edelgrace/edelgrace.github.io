          <p><p>I have been following <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/">Justin Guitar</a>&#8216;s lesson plans for learning the guitar.</p>

<p>This week I went through the first 15 beginner&rsquo;s course lessons, BC-101 to BC-115. I learned the basics of choosing a guitar, posture, etc. In terms of actually playing, I learned the D chord, A chord, and E chord. The first two chords were incredibly &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; The chord that really stumped me was the E chord. I could not press down on the strings hard enough so that it didn&rsquo;t sound muted. It got easier in the middle of the week because my fingers hurt less from pressing down on the strings so often.</p>

<p>The lesson I&rsquo;m working on right now is trying to get the most chord changes in one minute. The idea is to aim for 30 changes in one minute. Speed is the main factor here and not so much how good it sounds.</p>

<p>Here are the results of my first two tries:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Chord</th>
<th>Round 1</th>
<th>Round 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>D chord &#8211; A chord</td>
<td>17 changes</td>
<td>27 changes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>D chord &#8211; E chord</td>
<td>21 changes</td>
<td>31 changes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>E chord &#8211; A chord</td>
<td>26 changes</td>
<td>30 changes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The next couple of lessons will be more chords, I predict. I&rsquo;m not quite sure. Hopefully I can stick to this for another week!</p>

          </div>

          <p><p>Disclaimer: Lyrics relating to suicide is mentioned in this post.</p>

<p>Another disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not good at writing reviews but I do like expressing my opinions. This is in no way a professional review but rather how I personally feel about this album.</p>

<p>I know Marina and the Diamonds&rsquo; album <em>Electra Heart</em> is one of her personally least favourite works but I like it a lot. Many people think <em>Electra Heart</em> represents an alter-ego but it&rsquo;s rather a personality that Marina holds in disdain. I actually kinda love it. While some songs do resonate with my own personality, the overall theme of the corrupted American dream doesn&rsquo;t coincide with my reality. But you have to admit that there are some catchy tunes on this album.</p>

<p>The album starts off with <em>Bubblegum Bitch</em>, which I was really apprehensive about at first. It turned out to be a really high energy song with a fun and catchy chorus. The guitar ripping througg the song really made it for me. It added a certain ironic feel that set the tone for the rest of the album.</p>

<p>The much loved <em>Primadonna</em> comes right after. It&rsquo;s a little jarring to think about two different types of people as the topic one after the other (although, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive personalities). However, this was the song that got me sucked into Marina and the Diamonds. I hate to say it but Marina&rsquo;s voice is perfect for capturing the entitled persona in this song and I fall all over it. Even though you know she doesn&rsquo;t deserve anything good, you can&rsquo;t help but give it to her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not a huge fan of <em>Lies</em>. I like slower songs but I really hate that cheesy drum clap thing going on. It&rsquo;s not you, Marina, it&rsquo;s me.</p>

<p><em>Homewrecker</em> is a favourite of mine. I love the image a stereotypical American woman casually destroying marriages. Okay, that sounded bad. I don&rsquo;t condone that at all but I just find it amazing how well this song captures the stereotype. It&rsquo;s so easy to picture this person in your head.</p>

<p>The next track on the album is another one of my favourites: <em>Starring Role</em>. While thinking about this song, I realized how self centered all the songs on the album are so far and this is no exception. This song speaks about being the number one in someone&rsquo;s life and not willing to take second place. However, it&rsquo;s not as selfish as it sounds and I can sympathize with it. I also can overlook the cheesy clapping because I get chills whenever Marina sings &ldquo;The starring role.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will have to admit that I don&rsquo;t have any strong feelings for <em>The State of Dreaming</em>. I like how it picks up during the chorus and they way Marina sings &ldquo;My life is play&rdquo; but in between those moments, it&rsquo;s a little boring. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s a song that I would skip sometimes.</p>

<p><em>Power and Control</em> is true to its name and Marina&rsquo;s voice just exudes the song&rsquo;s theme. There&rsquo;s something about that booming voice that portrays confidence that the song calls for; someone ambitious who wants to get as much as possible with as little work as possible.</p>

<p>A lot of people seem to like <em>Teen Idle</em> a lot but I think this is one of my least favourite tracks on the album. The teen angst is just too much for me. Much of this album is over the top and extravagant but I can&rsquo;t seem to enjoy this. I find the song a little bit boring but I like the irony in how the line &ldquo;feeling super, super, super (super!) suicidal&rdquo; is executed in a cheery way. But this song doesn&rsquo;t jive with me at all.</p>

<p>The slow songs continue with <em>Valley of the Dolls</em>. While this isn&rsquo;t a super favourite, I don&rsquo;t mind this song much. I like the chorus a lot and the lyrics are pretty relatable. In my opinion, this song speaks of donning multiple personalities but ultimately not knowing who you really are at the core. It&rsquo;s a pretty dark and speaks of death. Death of another personality or the physical person, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>I understand that the album is essentially a concept album that is operatic and has a story arch in the fashion as Green Day&rsquo;s <em>American Idiot</em> but it&rsquo;s a little bit draining to have so many slow songs in a row. There are theories that this album&rsquo;s second half indicated the dying of the Electra Heart persona. This is not to say that <em>Hypocrates</em> isn&rsquo;t a good song but I prefer it when I&rsquo;m not listening to the album as a whole. I really like the mellow guitar and and the twinkling strings and Marina&rsquo;s voice taking a softer and less abrasive tone. This is another song that I don&rsquo;t mind much but don&rsquo;t like it enough to save it to my Spotify library.</p>

<p>The album finishes off with <em>Fear and Loathing</em> which marks the end of Electra Heart. I do not like this song much. However, I am impressed with Marina&rsquo;s higher register even if I still prefer when she reaches those lower notes. Conceptually, it isn&rsquo;t a bad way to end the album.</p>

<p>Overall, I drastically prefer the first half of the album. I like this album but it&rsquo;s not one I&rsquo;d go out of my way to buy but rather buy select songs off of it. The concept is interesting and Marina doesn&rsquo;t play around when it comes to her lyrics. It&rsquo;s pretty cohesive as a whole. I really admire Marina and I like how she is continually trying out different things. Let&rsquo;s see where she goes next with her music!</p>

          <h4>Oct 9, 2016 | <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/life/bought-some-new-music/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></h4>
          
          <div class="tags">

                <li><a href="/categories/music">Music</a></li>            
                
    
                
              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been using Spotify a lot. I only ever use it when I&rsquo;m at my computer. When I&rsquo;m on the go, I turn to my trusty iPod classic. Since I use the free version of Spotify (now that I have a job, I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m a broke college student anymore but I can say that I&rsquo;m still cheap), being able to choose what I listen to is a must and Spotify mobile doesn&rsquo;t have that ability. The contrast between the songs on my iPod and Spotify is staggering.</p>

<p>On my iPod, I have a bunch of foreign artists, mainly Japanese and Korean with a side of Taiwanese. If you look at my Spotify, it&rsquo;s mostly a bunch of really poppy Western mainstream music. I&rsquo;ve discovered a lot of new artists through Spotify simply because the Japanese catalogues on Spotify is sparse and I value accurate tagging (English translations of song titles vs. the original Japanese characters on the back of a CD) too much to listen to some of the Japanese music that is on Spotify.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s always a treat when I happen to get my hands on an iTunes gift card (remember, I said I&rsquo;m cheap). Except it&rsquo;s also hard trying to figure out what I want to buy with it because I can only choose the best. I only managed to squeeze out 9 songs from my $10 gift card but it&rsquo;s like 35 minutes worth of music so $0.28 cents per minute? I actually have no idea if that&rsquo;s a good amount or not.</p>

<p>On to what I bought!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>E is For Estranged by Owen Pallett</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t discover Owen Pallett from Spotify (my ex introduced me to him) but I did discover this song on Spotify! Even though the storyline of the song doesn&rsquo;t relate to me at all, I associate this song with myself as my name starts with E. There&rsquo;s something incredibly nostalgic about this song with a dash of good old melancholy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Icarus, Bint Elkhandaq, and Maghawir by Mashrou&rsquo; Leila</strong></p>

<p>When I used to be obsessed with TCGs, I was inspired for a couple of months to make a TCG of my own: an Asian music inspired TCG. Except I was determined to include Asian countries that weren&rsquo;t just Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. On my search, I came across Lebanese based alternative band Mashrou&rsquo; Leila. They were more secular than I expected with songs covering topics such as homosexuality, clubbing, and politics but I mostly fell in love with their catchy tunes! Their latest album (which all three of these song are from) is a bit more on the poppy side but I honestly love the entire album so just picking a few songs to buy was difficult.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Let Me Go! feat. Sophie Hunger by Erik Truffaz 4tet</strong></p>

<p>I stumbled onto this song purely by chance, thanks to Mashrou&rsquo; Leila. The lead singer of Mashrou&rsquo; Leila performed a cover of this song from Erik Truffaz 4tet. I was enchanted by it and hurried to listen to the original. Hearing it being sung in English hit me hard. Sophie Hunger has a perfect voice for this song. It has a sense of longing to break free that she captures perfectly.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Paris is Burning and All My Stars Aligned by St. Vincent</strong></p>

<p>I had heard of St. Vincent before but wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what she was about. I <em>think</em> she came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify one day and and according to my Last.fm, it was most likely <strong>Paris is Burning</strong>. The song was unbelievably quirky and I fell in love instantly. It took me a couple of months to listen to the rest of the <strong>Marry Me</strong> album and <strong>All My Stars Aligned</strong> was one of the songs that resonated with me. It was an obvious jab at people who turn to superstitions (astrology, palm reading, etc.) which I sometimes dabble in but I loved it so much. Also St. Vincent is an absolutely beautiful human being.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Human Sadness by Julian Casablancas + The Voidz</strong></p>

<p>This song I know for sure came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify. I had been listening to some of Julian&rsquo;s tracks from his solo album <strong>Phrazes for the Young</strong> for a bit up to that point. When I heard <strong>Human Sadness</strong>, it hit all the right buttons with me and I knew I had to know more about this Julian dude. Long 10 minute epic? Check. Grungy lo-fi vibe? Check. Cool guitar riffs? Check. Depressing song title? Check. Depressing song lyrics? Check. Although once I learned the lyrics, some of the impact the song had on me was a little reduced but there are some gems. &ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s a skull, I think it&rsquo;s grinning&rdquo; is one of them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>You Only live Once by The Strokes</strong></p>

<p>The original YOLO. Okay, when I found out Julian Casablancas was the lead singer of The Strokes, my mind was blown. I immediately dived in head first into their music after finding this out. Okay, I&rsquo;m still on their first album and last EP but there is a lot to digest. <del>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, part of the reason why I love this song is because Julian is so damn beautiful in the music video.</del> Something about this song makes me want to get up and dance, strangely enough. I also can&rsquo;t resist singing along to this song. It&rsquo;s so British rock that I would have totally thought they were British if I didn&rsquo;t know any better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Songs that I totally want to buy next time:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cool by Gwen Stefani</strong></p>

<p>I went through a really weird and brief Gwen Stefani phase earlier in the year. I don&rsquo;t know how it came about. I remember seeing this music video on Much Music and dismissing it as Gwen acting all sexy in a luxurious mansion but now what I get from it is that Gwen is gorgeous is a brunette. Okay, I did get more out of it. It&rsquo;s actually quite a mature song when I think about it. It takes a lot to look back at a past relationship (that first love you thought that you would marry, at that) and fully accept that you&rsquo;ve both moved on while still being close friends. I&rsquo;m a bit of a romantic in that way, I guess.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Cruel by St. Vincent</strong></p>

<p>My love for this woman is neverending. The guitar solo isn&rsquo;t long at all but it&rsquo;s the highlight of the song, in my opinion. I love how St. Vincent tackles the subject of the unappreciated parental figure. Also, props to St. Vincent for using gender neutral language (she refers to this unappreciated person as &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; throughout the song).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Galaxy by LADIES&rsquo; CODE</strong></p>

<p>This song is sexy. I can&rsquo;t say more about it, unfortunately, haha! This is a Korean girl group which I found on Spotify, which is a little rare for me. I like this song a lot.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Utada Hikaru&rsquo;s new album!!!!!!!</strong></p>

<p>I was tempted to spend all $10 on this album but I decided against it as the songs I&rsquo;ve listened to on the album I already own. I want a more concrete opinion of the album before I buy it. The teaser for the Shiina Ringo collaboration was so tempting. But I like making informed buying decisions. I know I won&rsquo;t be disappointed since it&rsquo;s Utada Hikaru, but still.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unrequited Love by CAPSULE</strong></p>

<p>While on my latest trip to the Philippines, I listened to <em>WAVE</em> <em>RUNNER</em> multiple times on the plane there. A lot of people complain about how Western the album is. EDM and dubstep is horrible. Toshiko doesn&rsquo;t sing much. Blah, blah, blah&hellip; I personally found the album to be pretty good. Honestly, I dismiss comments that complain of foreign music being &ldquo;too Western.&rdquo; In my mind it implies a weird exoticizing take on foreign music. Anyway, I really like this song, despite not being heavy into electronic music. Toshiko has great lines.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls by The Weekend</strong></p>

<p>The earlier works of The Weekend are intoxicating. Seriously, The Weekend&rsquo;s super clean vocals mixed with the heavy beats make for songs that make you feel like you&rsquo;re on a trip (is that how the kids say it nowadays). This song is just intoxicating in a seductive way.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Primadonna by Marina and the Diamonds</strong></p>

<p>Marina is HOT. Her Electra Heart era reawakened my hidden feelings for Vanessa Hudgens (you can&rsquo;t deny that Marina looks at least a little like Vanessa!). But yeah, there&rsquo;s something really attractive about her Electra Heart persona. It&rsquo;s a shame that she doesn&rsquo;t view the era as a great period in her career because I love it. Primadonna is like a rich spoiled girl anthem and I can&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Divers by Joanna Newsome</strong></p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot about this song. Unfortunately, Joanna doesn&rsquo;t have her music on Spotify so unless I&rsquo;m on YouTube, I don&rsquo;t listen to this song. Which is a great reason why I need this song! I think I&rsquo;ve written about <em>Divers</em> before but I will reiterate once again that I am IN LOVE with Joanna. She&rsquo;s extremely polarizing. You either kiss the earth she walks on or think her voice is like nails on chalkboard. This is a masterpiece and I love her. I totally regret not buying this now. Damn, how could I forget this song?</p></li>

          <p><p>Ugh I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had a dream where I literally just lived out my entire day, down to sitting in lecture being bored and taking notes.</p>

<p>You don’t even know how disappointed I am when I woke up knowing that I had to do it all over again.</p></li>

<li><p>I’m using emacs via SSH for my CS assignment and the backspace key doesn’t mean backspace, the del key means backspace AND I KEEP HITTING BACKSPACE. I’m so frustrated. I don’t want to change the settings either because what if I do something I shouldn’t do because I’m on my university&rsquo;s servers.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes I like to think that my faith in humanity is so strong that I can leave my stuff anywhere at the university without asking anyone to watch it but I just really don’t want to talk to people.</p></li>

<li><p>so I just listened to DIR EN GREY’s new single. Sustain the Untruth. Hmm. I think it will grow on me. I like the intro and outro (dat bass), the synth, and all that typical Kyo vocals (he sounds so sinister, wow, I&rsquo;m not surprised though). The chorus sounds a bit out of place to me. Overall it’s okay but I think it’s kinda anticlimatic.</p>

<p>BUT OMG. RUTEN NO TOU ACOUSTIC VERSION. That’s some godly music right there. But back to STU. the music video is also kinda lack lustre. How did the deg shoutbox put it? Kyo is like a zombie mary magdalene I don’t understand.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday I was mailing stuff (now three months ago) and there’s this guy at the mall who works at the knives store and he has a sweet mohawk. I was sitting nearby putting stamps on envelopes and an old lady asked him if she could touch his hair. it was kinda cute but at the same time I wonder if he was annoyed but he sounded really cheerful so I guess not?</p></li>

<li><p>The best thing about Lindsay having a tumblr though is when she reblogs posts about Michael or about her and Michael and kinda fangirls over it. She’s like living the ultimate fangirl dream like, &ldquo;You see the person in this post? I’m getting married to this guy.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>I feel so happy for recognizing Rie Fu’s voice but it’s only because she sang in really fluent English. Hourou Musuko is the sweetest anime I have ever watched. Yeah, it’s a slice of life school anime but I really love how it treated the LGBTQ issues. It all seems so perfect though. If only more people facing those issues received the support the characters did. And if only people reacted the way the characters did. Wow, so sweet.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-809" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-809">1</a></sup></p></li>

          <p><p><strong>Warning: Suicide content warning.</strong></p>

<p>My philosophy with this blog has always been to approach in a very casual and informal way. I was inspired by a blog to do so, but I don&rsquo;t quite remember what site it was exactly (I&rsquo;m tempted to say it was <a href="http://6birds.net">6birds</a>, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure). I try to have this mindset whenever I need to write a blog post. Even so, I don&rsquo;t entirely feel free in writing whatever I want.</p>

<p>In a way, I guess my layout at the moment is pretty intimidating for me. I kinda feel like I have to write a lot just to make one paragraph more than 3 lines. Not to mention that there are people out there who have screens that are way bigger than mine, so the stuff that I write must look extremely tiny to them<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-786">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Also, Tumblr is still a problem for me. I tend to publish really short thoughts of mine on Tumblr. Some of them could easily be tweets instead, while some are too long to be a tweet but still too short for an actual blog post. Nevertheless, I wish I could approach this blog as casually as I do with Tumblr. I still don&rsquo;t know what it is about Tumblr that makes me want to post every single detail of my life.</p>

<p>But I guess I should write a life update or something?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently on semester break and cherishing every single moment of nothingness because I&rsquo;ll be taking spring semester and summer semester courses. It&rsquo;s crazy, I know. But like, I&rsquo;m extremely determined to graduate in 2016, even though it looks like it&rsquo;ll be impossible. I can get all of my options done right away but the computer science department doesn&rsquo;t offer courses during the spring and summer so there&rsquo;s no real way to get ahead. So far, I&rsquo;ll graduate a semester later than I want.</p>

<p>On a different note, I&rsquo;m working on a super secret project<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-786">2</a></sup> that involves a lot of Google Image searches. I may or may not have been browsing Taiji pictures and got suddenly distracted by X JAPAN feelings.</p>

<p>If you listen to Japanese rock, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to avoid the inevitable X JAPAN phase. I mostly rode that out when I was in grade ten, but I still love listening to X JAPAN today. Who is X JAPAN? Only one of the most influential and well known metal acts in Japan. They&rsquo;re crazy famous in Japan, but I&rsquo;m not so sure if that&rsquo;s still the case.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tragedy and drama surrounding the band, hence the X JAPAN feelings. X JAPAN first broke up in 1997, and a year later, one of the most loved members, hide, (allegedly) committed suicide. The impact was huge. Think Michael Jackson huge. There were a couple of copycat suicides (both successful and unsuccessful), and around 50,000 fans lined the streets on the day of his funeral.</p>

<p>I remember reading interviews with the drummer, Yoshiki, about the grief he felt and still felt years after. I don&rsquo;t remember the site anymore, but there are a few (barely accurate) quotes that I remember from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine myself in my thirties. When I was younger, my father committed suicide. He was 33. I could never imagine myself older than my father. It just so happened that hide was the same age&hellip; 33.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason, that really cut deep. A small, simple, and hopefully innocent coincidence that could really tear a person apart. Gosh, and then Yoshiki goes to say things that just hurt for some reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never imagined that end for him, I thought it would be me.</p>

<p>If I had never formed this band, if I had never met him, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine the guilt he must have felt. But I feel like the one who felt the most responsible was Toshi. Toshi initiated the disbandonment of the band in the first place, because he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t properly balance his solo activities with X JAPAN activities. In another interview with Yoshiki, he recalls calling the band members to discuss Toshi leaving the band. The first thing hide said was, &ldquo;But what will become of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yoshiki couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of having a band without Toshi (all of the songs were written solely for Toshi&rsquo;s voice), but he did entertain hide in looking for a new vocalist. I think they both knew it would be impossible for X to come back without Toshi.</p>

<p>Recently, I just watched their reunion video<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-786">3</a></sup>, and Toshi could barely keep himself together while singing their number one love song, <em>Forever Love</em>. The crowd would sing for him as he wept and he could barely play the chords and his voice kept cracking and it was honestly really hard to watch.</p>

<p>I hope he has forgiven himself by now.</p>

<p>But the tragedy and drama doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Toshi had been involved in an alleged cult which he just recently got out of, and his wife was living with the director (?) of said cult. He divorced his wife and is brankrupt due to the swindling of the cult. Wow. That&rsquo;s some intense stuff there.</p>

<p>Around the same time, the form bassist Taiji comitted suicide. He was arrested for alleged assault while on an airplane, and he hung himself in jail. He left the band a long time ago, but X JAPAN is still frequently attached to his name. It&rsquo;s sad because it seemed like he was getting his life back together, after years of abusing drugs and alcohol.</p>

<p>But I still love this band. It&rsquo;s weird though. Watching videos and casually listening to music and suddenly thinking, &ldquo;This person doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s worse when I listen to hide&rsquo;s solo music. I hear someone incredibly innovative and risk taking and it&rsquo;s just unsettling to think of the end that came to him.</p>

<p>Life is too short.</p>
