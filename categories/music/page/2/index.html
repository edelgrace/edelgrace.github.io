          <p><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been using Spotify a lot. I only ever use it when I&rsquo;m at my computer. When I&rsquo;m on the go, I turn to my trusty iPod classic. Since I use the free version of Spotify (now that I have a job, I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m a broke college student anymore but I can say that I&rsquo;m still cheap), being able to choose what I listen to is a must and Spotify mobile doesn&rsquo;t have that ability. The contrast between the songs on my iPod and Spotify is staggering.</p>

<p>On my iPod, I have a bunch of foreign artists, mainly Japanese and Korean with a side of Taiwanese. If you look at my Spotify, it&rsquo;s mostly a bunch of really poppy Western mainstream music. I&rsquo;ve discovered a lot of new artists through Spotify simply because the Japanese catalogues on Spotify is sparse and I value accurate tagging (English translations of song titles vs. the original Japanese characters on the back of a CD) too much to listen to some of the Japanese music that is on Spotify.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s always a treat when I happen to get my hands on an iTunes gift card (remember, I said I&rsquo;m cheap). Except it&rsquo;s also hard trying to figure out what I want to buy with it because I can only choose the best. I only managed to squeeze out 9 songs from my $10 gift card but it&rsquo;s like 35 minutes worth of music so $0.28 cents per minute? I actually have no idea if that&rsquo;s a good amount or not.</p>

<p>On to what I bought!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>E is For Estranged by Owen Pallett</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t discover Owen Pallett from Spotify (my ex introduced me to him) but I did discover this song on Spotify! Even though the storyline of the song doesn&rsquo;t relate to me at all, I associate this song with myself as my name starts with E. There&rsquo;s something incredibly nostalgic about this song with a dash of good old melancholy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Icarus, Bint Elkhandaq, and Maghawir by Mashrou&rsquo; Leila</strong></p>

<p>When I used to be obsessed with TCGs, I was inspired for a couple of months to make a TCG of my own: an Asian music inspired TCG. Except I was determined to include Asian countries that weren&rsquo;t just Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. On my search, I came across Lebanese based alternative band Mashrou&rsquo; Leila. They were more secular than I expected with songs covering topics such as homosexuality, clubbing, and politics but I mostly fell in love with their catchy tunes! Their latest album (which all three of these song are from) is a bit more on the poppy side but I honestly love the entire album so just picking a few songs to buy was difficult.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Let Me Go! feat. Sophie Hunger by Erik Truffaz 4tet</strong></p>

<p>I stumbled onto this song purely by chance, thanks to Mashrou&rsquo; Leila. The lead singer of Mashrou&rsquo; Leila performed a cover of this song from Erik Truffaz 4tet. I was enchanted by it and hurried to listen to the original. Hearing it being sung in English hit me hard. Sophie Hunger has a perfect voice for this song. It has a sense of longing to break free that she captures perfectly.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Paris is Burning and All My Stars Aligned by St. Vincent</strong></p>

<p>I had heard of St. Vincent before but wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what she was about. I <em>think</em> she came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify one day and and according to my Last.fm, it was most likely <strong>Paris is Burning</strong>. The song was unbelievably quirky and I fell in love instantly. It took me a couple of months to listen to the rest of the <strong>Marry Me</strong> album and <strong>All My Stars Aligned</strong> was one of the songs that resonated with me. It was an obvious jab at people who turn to superstitions (astrology, palm reading, etc.) which I sometimes dabble in but I loved it so much. Also St. Vincent is an absolutely beautiful human being.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Human Sadness by Julian Casablancas + The Voidz</strong></p>

<p>This song I know for sure came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify. I had been listening to some of Julian&rsquo;s tracks from his solo album <strong>Phrazes for the Young</strong> for a bit up to that point. When I heard <strong>Human Sadness</strong>, it hit all the right buttons with me and I knew I had to know more about this Julian dude. Long 10 minute epic? Check. Grungy lo-fi vibe? Check. Cool guitar riffs? Check. Depressing song title? Check. Depressing song lyrics? Check. Although once I learned the lyrics, some of the impact the song had on me was a little reduced but there are some gems. &ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s a skull, I think it&rsquo;s grinning&rdquo; is one of them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>You Only live Once by The Strokes</strong></p>

<p>The original YOLO. Okay, when I found out Julian Casablancas was the lead singer of The Strokes, my mind was blown. I immediately dived in head first into their music after finding this out. Okay, I&rsquo;m still on their first album and last EP but there is a lot to digest. <del>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, part of the reason why I love this song is because Julian is so damn beautiful in the music video.</del> Something about this song makes me want to get up and dance, strangely enough. I also can&rsquo;t resist singing along to this song. It&rsquo;s so British rock that I would have totally thought they were British if I didn&rsquo;t know any better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Songs that I totally want to buy next time:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cool by Gwen Stefani</strong></p>

<p>I went through a really weird and brief Gwen Stefani phase earlier in the year. I don&rsquo;t know how it came about. I remember seeing this music video on Much Music and dismissing it as Gwen acting all sexy in a luxurious mansion but now what I get from it is that Gwen is gorgeous is a brunette. Okay, I did get more out of it. It&rsquo;s actually quite a mature song when I think about it. It takes a lot to look back at a past relationship (that first love you thought that you would marry, at that) and fully accept that you&rsquo;ve both moved on while still being close friends. I&rsquo;m a bit of a romantic in that way, I guess.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Cruel by St. Vincent</strong></p>

<p>My love for this woman is neverending. The guitar solo isn&rsquo;t long at all but it&rsquo;s the highlight of the song, in my opinion. I love how St. Vincent tackles the subject of the unappreciated parental figure. Also, props to St. Vincent for using gender neutral language (she refers to this unappreciated person as &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; throughout the song).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Galaxy by LADIES&rsquo; CODE</strong></p>

<p>This song is sexy. I can&rsquo;t say more about it, unfortunately, haha! This is a Korean girl group which I found on Spotify, which is a little rare for me. I like this song a lot.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Utada Hikaru&rsquo;s new album!!!!!!!</strong></p>

<p>I was tempted to spend all $10 on this album but I decided against it as the songs I&rsquo;ve listened to on the album I already own. I want a more concrete opinion of the album before I buy it. The teaser for the Shiina Ringo collaboration was so tempting. But I like making informed buying decisions. I know I won&rsquo;t be disappointed since it&rsquo;s Utada Hikaru, but still.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unrequited Love by CAPSULE</strong></p>

<p>While on my latest trip to the Philippines, I listened to <em>WAVE</em> <em>RUNNER</em> multiple times on the plane there. A lot of people complain about how Western the album is. EDM and dubstep is horrible. Toshiko doesn&rsquo;t sing much. Blah, blah, blah&hellip; I personally found the album to be pretty good. Honestly, I dismiss comments that complain of foreign music being &ldquo;too Western.&rdquo; In my mind it implies a weird exoticizing take on foreign music. Anyway, I really like this song, despite not being heavy into electronic music. Toshiko has great lines.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls by The Weekend</strong></p>

<p>The earlier works of The Weekend are intoxicating. Seriously, The Weekend&rsquo;s super clean vocals mixed with the heavy beats make for songs that make you feel like you&rsquo;re on a trip (is that how the kids say it nowadays). This song is just intoxicating in a seductive way.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Primadonna by Marina and the Diamonds</strong></p>

<p>Marina is HOT. Her Electra Heart era reawakened my hidden feelings for Vanessa Hudgens (you can&rsquo;t deny that Marina looks at least a little like Vanessa!). But yeah, there&rsquo;s something really attractive about her Electra Heart persona. It&rsquo;s a shame that she doesn&rsquo;t view the era as a great period in her career because I love it. Primadonna is like a rich spoiled girl anthem and I can&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Divers by Joanna Newsome</strong></p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot about this song. Unfortunately, Joanna doesn&rsquo;t have her music on Spotify so unless I&rsquo;m on YouTube, I don&rsquo;t listen to this song. Which is a great reason why I need this song! I think I&rsquo;ve written about <em>Divers</em> before but I will reiterate once again that I am IN LOVE with Joanna. She&rsquo;s extremely polarizing. You either kiss the earth she walks on or think her voice is like nails on chalkboard. This is a masterpiece and I love her. I totally regret not buying this now. Damn, how could I forget this song?</p></li>

          <p><p>Ugh I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had a dream where I literally just lived out my entire day, down to sitting in lecture being bored and taking notes.</p>

<p>You don’t even know how disappointed I am when I woke up knowing that I had to do it all over again.</p></li>

<li><p>I’m using emacs via SSH for my CS assignment and the backspace key doesn’t mean backspace, the del key means backspace AND I KEEP HITTING BACKSPACE. I’m so frustrated. I don’t want to change the settings either because what if I do something I shouldn’t do because I’m on my university&rsquo;s servers.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes I like to think that my faith in humanity is so strong that I can leave my stuff anywhere at the university without asking anyone to watch it but I just really don’t want to talk to people.</p></li>

<li><p>so I just listened to DIR EN GREY’s new single. Sustain the Untruth. Hmm. I think it will grow on me. I like the intro and outro (dat bass), the synth, and all that typical Kyo vocals (he sounds so sinister, wow, I&rsquo;m not surprised though). The chorus sounds a bit out of place to me. Overall it’s okay but I think it’s kinda anticlimatic.</p>

<p>BUT OMG. RUTEN NO TOU ACOUSTIC VERSION. That’s some godly music right there. But back to STU. the music video is also kinda lack lustre. How did the deg shoutbox put it? Kyo is like a zombie mary magdalene I don’t understand.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday I was mailing stuff (now three months ago) and there’s this guy at the mall who works at the knives store and he has a sweet mohawk. I was sitting nearby putting stamps on envelopes and an old lady asked him if she could touch his hair. it was kinda cute but at the same time I wonder if he was annoyed but he sounded really cheerful so I guess not?</p></li>

<li><p>The best thing about Lindsay having a tumblr though is when she reblogs posts about Michael or about her and Michael and kinda fangirls over it. She’s like living the ultimate fangirl dream like, &ldquo;You see the person in this post? I’m getting married to this guy.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>I feel so happy for recognizing Rie Fu’s voice but it’s only because she sang in really fluent English. Hourou Musuko is the sweetest anime I have ever watched. Yeah, it’s a slice of life school anime but I really love how it treated the LGBTQ issues. It all seems so perfect though. If only more people facing those issues received the support the characters did. And if only people reacted the way the characters did. Wow, so sweet.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-809" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-809">1</a></sup></p></li>

          <p><p><strong>Warning: Suicide content warning.</strong></p>

<p>My philosophy with this blog has always been to approach in a very casual and informal way. I was inspired by a blog to do so, but I don&rsquo;t quite remember what site it was exactly (I&rsquo;m tempted to say it was <a href="http://6birds.net">6birds</a>, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure). I try to have this mindset whenever I need to write a blog post. Even so, I don&rsquo;t entirely feel free in writing whatever I want.</p>

<p>In a way, I guess my layout at the moment is pretty intimidating for me. I kinda feel like I have to write a lot just to make one paragraph more than 3 lines. Not to mention that there are people out there who have screens that are way bigger than mine, so the stuff that I write must look extremely tiny to them<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-786">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Also, Tumblr is still a problem for me. I tend to publish really short thoughts of mine on Tumblr. Some of them could easily be tweets instead, while some are too long to be a tweet but still too short for an actual blog post. Nevertheless, I wish I could approach this blog as casually as I do with Tumblr. I still don&rsquo;t know what it is about Tumblr that makes me want to post every single detail of my life.</p>

<p>But I guess I should write a life update or something?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently on semester break and cherishing every single moment of nothingness because I&rsquo;ll be taking spring semester and summer semester courses. It&rsquo;s crazy, I know. But like, I&rsquo;m extremely determined to graduate in 2016, even though it looks like it&rsquo;ll be impossible. I can get all of my options done right away but the computer science department doesn&rsquo;t offer courses during the spring and summer so there&rsquo;s no real way to get ahead. So far, I&rsquo;ll graduate a semester later than I want.</p>

<p>On a different note, I&rsquo;m working on a super secret project<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-786">2</a></sup> that involves a lot of Google Image searches. I may or may not have been browsing Taiji pictures and got suddenly distracted by X JAPAN feelings.</p>

<p>If you listen to Japanese rock, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to avoid the inevitable X JAPAN phase. I mostly rode that out when I was in grade ten, but I still love listening to X JAPAN today. Who is X JAPAN? Only one of the most influential and well known metal acts in Japan. They&rsquo;re crazy famous in Japan, but I&rsquo;m not so sure if that&rsquo;s still the case.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tragedy and drama surrounding the band, hence the X JAPAN feelings. X JAPAN first broke up in 1997, and a year later, one of the most loved members, hide, (allegedly) committed suicide. The impact was huge. Think Michael Jackson huge. There were a couple of copycat suicides (both successful and unsuccessful), and around 50,000 fans lined the streets on the day of his funeral.</p>

<p>I remember reading interviews with the drummer, Yoshiki, about the grief he felt and still felt years after. I don&rsquo;t remember the site anymore, but there are a few (barely accurate) quotes that I remember from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine myself in my thirties. When I was younger, my father committed suicide. He was 33. I could never imagine myself older than my father. It just so happened that hide was the same age&hellip; 33.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason, that really cut deep. A small, simple, and hopefully innocent coincidence that could really tear a person apart. Gosh, and then Yoshiki goes to say things that just hurt for some reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never imagined that end for him, I thought it would be me.</p>

<p>If I had never formed this band, if I had never met him, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine the guilt he must have felt. But I feel like the one who felt the most responsible was Toshi. Toshi initiated the disbandonment of the band in the first place, because he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t properly balance his solo activities with X JAPAN activities. In another interview with Yoshiki, he recalls calling the band members to discuss Toshi leaving the band. The first thing hide said was, &ldquo;But what will become of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yoshiki couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of having a band without Toshi (all of the songs were written solely for Toshi&rsquo;s voice), but he did entertain hide in looking for a new vocalist. I think they both knew it would be impossible for X to come back without Toshi.</p>

<p>Recently, I just watched their reunion video<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-786">3</a></sup>, and Toshi could barely keep himself together while singing their number one love song, <em>Forever Love</em>. The crowd would sing for him as he wept and he could barely play the chords and his voice kept cracking and it was honestly really hard to watch.</p>

<p>I hope he has forgiven himself by now.</p>

<p>But the tragedy and drama doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Toshi had been involved in an alleged cult which he just recently got out of, and his wife was living with the director (?) of said cult. He divorced his wife and is brankrupt due to the swindling of the cult. Wow. That&rsquo;s some intense stuff there.</p>

<p>Around the same time, the form bassist Taiji comitted suicide. He was arrested for alleged assault while on an airplane, and he hung himself in jail. He left the band a long time ago, but X JAPAN is still frequently attached to his name. It&rsquo;s sad because it seemed like he was getting his life back together, after years of abusing drugs and alcohol.</p>

<p>But I still love this band. It&rsquo;s weird though. Watching videos and casually listening to music and suddenly thinking, &ldquo;This person doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s worse when I listen to hide&rsquo;s solo music. I hear someone incredibly innovative and risk taking and it&rsquo;s just unsettling to think of the end that came to him.</p>

<p>Life is too short.</p>

          <p><p>Since I gave up Tumblr for Lent, I realized how much free time I had on my hands without Tumblr. I decided, why not get back into TCGs? And so I did.</p>

<p>TCG stands for &ldquo;Trading Card Game.&rdquo; There are TCGs around the Internet that you can join as long as you yourself have a bit of space on the Internet. The goal of the game is basically to collect all the cards that are available in the game. They aren&rsquo;t like the strategy TCGs where players duel against each other (in other words, it&rsquo;s <strong>not like</strong> Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh!). However, you can trade cards with other players. To get cards, you have to play games like hangman, tic-tac-toe, etc. Some TCGs get really creative with the games but not all TCGs do.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the appeal of TCGs are. I don&rsquo;t even know how I got into TCGs in the first place!</p>

<p>The very first TCG I joined was called <em>Very Beauty</em>. The link is dead now and has been dead for quite a while. The site went on hiatus around the summer of 2012. It focused on Japanese music and entertainment. I mostly joined it for the music aspect. The cards I collected mostly were of rockers, haha. DIR EN GREY and L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel, were of course, my main priorities! Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t manage to master any decks while I was a part of that TCG.</p>

<p>Looking back on it now, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the card templates. It was so confusing as there were two different sizes for the cards. It made it easier to distinguish the different card types but at the same time, it looked like clutter! Below are some of the cards, that I managed to snag before the site closed down. The first one is of hide from X JAPAN, the second is of the music video LEECH by The Gazette, and lastly, is the beautiful Acchan from Perfume!</p>

</p>

<p>However, my favourite TCG is <a href="http://rapture.lightning-blade.net/">Rapture</a>. This TCG is themed around boy pairings in animanga and video games. I&rsquo;m actually not a huge fan of boy pairings, to be honest. It&rsquo;s weird, I know! The only two boy pairings that I ship are Oreki and Fukube from <em>Hyouka</em> and Kaworu and Shinji from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. But I joined this TCG anwyay. I just love the card templates! Rapture is definitely one of the prettiest TCGs out there right now.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m actually pretty decent with this TCG! I&rsquo;ve already mastered a couple of decks already. In fact, I think this is the only TCG where I have actually mastered any decks. Currently though, I&rsquo;m working to master the Kaworu x Shinji deck. I just recently finished Evangelion, so that&rsquo;s a fairly recent ship of mine.</p>

<p>But like, look at these cards&hellip; So pretty! Featuring Xanxus x Superbia Squalo from <em>Katekyo Hitman REBORN!</em>, Kaworu x Shinji from <em>NGE</em>, and Houtarou x Satoshi from <em>Hyouka</em>.</p>

</p>

<p>However, right now I&rsquo;m waiting on a Japanese music TCG. There&rsquo;s a couple that are inactive, which makes me sad! There are A LOT of Korean pop music TCGs floating around. I joined one of them. I don&rsquo;t even listen to that much K-Pop. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m mostly just collecting 2NE1, BIG BANG, AOA, Younha, and BoA decks right now. I also collect decks that have cute short haired girls in them. K-Pop girls are really cute, okay?</p>

          <p><p>Man, lately I&rsquo;ve just been scouring the Internet (okay, YouTube) for new music. I&rsquo;m so hungry for new music! Anyway, here are my findings.</p>

<p><strong>Buhar Jerreau</strong><br />
These guys are at the top of my list at the moment. They&rsquo;re a hip-hop/rap group of three guys from Kazakhstan. According to translations of their lyrics, I find them to be extremely talented at song writing. I really am in love with the beats of their songs (I don&rsquo;t know rap lingo&hellip;). They all just make me bob my head. <del>It helps that all of them are really attractive too.</del> From what I could find, they have a dozen or so songs released but not much.<br />
<strong>Favourite song(s):</strong> Мост<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-702">1</a></sup>, Текстиль<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-702">2</a></sup>, 498<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-702">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Yeng Constantino</strong><br />
She&rsquo;s definitely not new to me but my love her has rekindled in the form of this duet cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcXdxynVn80">Kahit Maputi Na Ang Buhok Ko</a> (Even Though My Hair is White). I really love Yeng&rsquo;s voic. So soft and pure. I suspect some autotune in this track though, but that&rsquo;s not to say <em>all</em> autotune is bad. We already know Yeng has a great voice, so it&rsquo;s no insult to her. But yes. Her voice in this song makes me melt. She recently got engaged (not to the dude in the video) so I feel like her feelings in singing this song was genuine.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Panginoon (Lord)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-702">4</a></sup>, Josephine<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_5-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_5-702">5</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>在日ファンク (Zainichi Funk/Japan Funk)</strong><br />
I have absolutely no idea how I stumbled across this band. Their a jazz/funk band from Japan. They get accussed of (I say accussed because it almost always has a negative connotation to it) of being a James Brown rip off. I personally have no problem with this because they are amazing. The live band with instruments are so top. The vocalist has a distinct voice and yeah, it&rsquo;s totally James Brown at times. If you watch performances, you can see the vocalist has moves. Man. Dude can dance!<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> 嘘 (Uso/Lie)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_6-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_6-702">6</a></sup>, 爆弾こわい (Bakudan Kowai/Scary Bomb) <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_7-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_7-702">7</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Predawn</strong><br />
Another musician from Japan. Apparently her name is Miwako Shimizu. She has a very soft crooning sort of voice that hipsters would absolutely love. I&rsquo;m no hipster but I&rsquo;m still super in love with her! She sings almost entirely in English, I think. Her voice is so soft that sometimes it can be hard to understand her but her accent sounds like it&rsquo;s English (as in London, England). It seems so fluent! And her lyrics are top notch too. Pretty much almost at Joanna Newsom&rsquo;s level of song writing.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Keep Silence<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_8-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_8-702">8</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Astrud Gilberto</strong><br />
A Brazilian bossa nova from the 60s. I absolutely love her voice. Like I said, I&rsquo;m not a musician but her voice at time sounds a bit monotone or flat but it still manages to bring a sense of personality into her music and creates a unique atmosphere. I love her voice and the songs she performs! She also has a cute accent. She was also pretty cute back in the day.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> How Insensitive<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_9-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_9-702">9</a></sup>, Fly Me to the Moon<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_10-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_10-702">10</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Hitomit Takahashi</strong><br />
Ugh, I forgot she existed! She did some theme songs for a couple of animes (Bokutachi wa no Yukue for Gundam SEED Destiny is the one that introduced me to her) but after I finished the anime, I barely touched any of her other songs. I was feeling nostalgic and decided to check out if she had new songs. She did! I barely recognized her, voice and face wise. She changed so much! Was Gundam SEED Destiny that old? Answer is kinda (10 years ago, wow).<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Wo Ai Ni<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_11-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_11-702">11</a></sup>, MUSIC<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_12-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_12-702">12</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>MEG</strong><br />
Last and certainly not least, is MEG. I love MEG. I&rsquo;m utterly in love with MEG. She&rsquo;s beautiful. She doesn&rsquo;t have a strong voice and usually relies on heavily mixed and autotuned songs but they&rsquo;re still catchy and great. There is something about her that captivates me. She knows she&rsquo;s cute and sexy and she owns it and she sells it. She&rsquo;s also a fashion designer and wow, her clothes are A+, I think (I don&rsquo;t know about fashiion, haha).<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> TRAP<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_13-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_13-702">13</a></sup>,WEAR I AM <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_14-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_14-702">14</a></sup></p>

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_1-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZK_8jh4ySo">x</a>] The music video is really well done. This is a song with a REALLY catchy beat. The chorus is really simplistic but it just hooks you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_1-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_2-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZjyRKFqi5s">x</a>] The comments on the video is all about T.O.P, lol. The main dude, I don&rsquo;t know their names yet, has a voice a lot like T.O.P&rsquo;s in this song. Another song with a catchy beat. I love the industrial booming sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_2-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_3-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeA22r9YnRQ">x</a>] This has like a mishmash of styles. It has a slight &ldquo;I Got a Boy&rdquo; feeling to it in terms of the mishmashing. I admit, my favourite part is at the end when the song is consumed by the melody. Gives me chills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_3-702"></a>

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_6-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq1nNykPCDQ">x</a>] Very calm and smooth. The vocalist may be trying too hard to be soft, his voice wavers a lot or is that intentional vibrato? I will never know because I&rsquo;m not a musician. Still love the song though.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_6-702"></a>

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_7-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H14XFS1zVo">x</a>] This song is so high energy! I love it! It&rsquo;s also super catchy. I want to dance around and sing along.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_7-702"></a>

  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_8-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58-RRCU0OPY">x</a>] I song that I think I can related to. There&rsquo;s something magical about it. Very whimsical.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_8-702"></a>

  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_9-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x2i2GITQ0Y">x</a>] The song that started it all. I loved it because her voice really added to the &ldquo;cold&rdquo; and &ldquo;unmoved&rdquo; aspect of the song.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_9-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_10-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqjiEOLHhas">x</a>] I love Frank Sinatra but I love pretty much every version of Fly Me to the Moon except for his original version. Do I love this version? yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_10-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_11-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10kPphUY8hA">x</a>] Technically Hitomi features in this song but omg. Might as well give her the song if she sings 90% of it, right? That said, I love BEAT CRUSADERS as well. This song is so cute and energetic. I want to jump around when I listen to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_11-702"></a>

  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_12-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBy2QcFLLzA">x</a>] Very simple song but very catchy. Not used to Hitomi with long hair. I don&rsquo;t know if it suits her. Her voice though. I can hear a little bit of the old Hitomi but not too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_12-702"></a>

  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_13-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BymanWZK1GA">x</a>] Omg. Omg??? OMG??? This song is really chic, sexy, and sophisticated. Has a lot of &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; influence and wow, the clothes. MEG really sells this song. Every time I listen to it or watched the video, my heart races and I&rsquo;m always singing along. I fell for your trap, are you happy now MEG?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_13-702"></a>
