          <p><p><strong>Warning: Suicide content warning.</strong></p>

<p>My philosophy with this blog has always been to approach in a very casual and informal way. I was inspired by a blog to do so, but I don&rsquo;t quite remember what site it was exactly (I&rsquo;m tempted to say it was <a href="http://6birds.net">6birds</a>, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure). I try to have this mindset whenever I need to write a blog post. Even so, I don&rsquo;t entirely feel free in writing whatever I want.</p>

<p>In a way, I guess my layout at the moment is pretty intimidating for me. I kinda feel like I have to write a lot just to make one paragraph more than 3 lines. Not to mention that there are people out there who have screens that are way bigger than mine, so the stuff that I write must look extremely tiny to them<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-786">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Also, Tumblr is still a problem for me. I tend to publish really short thoughts of mine on Tumblr. Some of them could easily be tweets instead, while some are too long to be a tweet but still too short for an actual blog post. Nevertheless, I wish I could approach this blog as casually as I do with Tumblr. I still don&rsquo;t know what it is about Tumblr that makes me want to post every single detail of my life.</p>

<p>But I guess I should write a life update or something?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently on semester break and cherishing every single moment of nothingness because I&rsquo;ll be taking spring semester and summer semester courses. It&rsquo;s crazy, I know. But like, I&rsquo;m extremely determined to graduate in 2016, even though it looks like it&rsquo;ll be impossible. I can get all of my options done right away but the computer science department doesn&rsquo;t offer courses during the spring and summer so there&rsquo;s no real way to get ahead. So far, I&rsquo;ll graduate a semester later than I want.</p>

<p>On a different note, I&rsquo;m working on a super secret project<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-786">2</a></sup> that involves a lot of Google Image searches. I may or may not have been browsing Taiji pictures and got suddenly distracted by X JAPAN feelings.</p>

<p>If you listen to Japanese rock, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to avoid the inevitable X JAPAN phase. I mostly rode that out when I was in grade ten, but I still love listening to X JAPAN today. Who is X JAPAN? Only one of the most influential and well known metal acts in Japan. They&rsquo;re crazy famous in Japan, but I&rsquo;m not so sure if that&rsquo;s still the case.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tragedy and drama surrounding the band, hence the X JAPAN feelings. X JAPAN first broke up in 1997, and a year later, one of the most loved members, hide, (allegedly) committed suicide. The impact was huge. Think Michael Jackson huge. There were a couple of copycat suicides (both successful and unsuccessful), and around 50,000 fans lined the streets on the day of his funeral.</p>

<p>I remember reading interviews with the drummer, Yoshiki, about the grief he felt and still felt years after. I don&rsquo;t remember the site anymore, but there are a few (barely accurate) quotes that I remember from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine myself in my thirties. When I was younger, my father committed suicide. He was 33. I could never imagine myself older than my father. It just so happened that hide was the same age&hellip; 33.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason, that really cut deep. A small, simple, and hopefully innocent coincidence that could really tear a person apart. Gosh, and then Yoshiki goes to say things that just hurt for some reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never imagined that end for him, I thought it would be me.</p>

<p>If I had never formed this band, if I had never met him, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine the guilt he must have felt. But I feel like the one who felt the most responsible was Toshi. Toshi initiated the disbandonment of the band in the first place, because he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t properly balance his solo activities with X JAPAN activities. In another interview with Yoshiki, he recalls calling the band members to discuss Toshi leaving the band. The first thing hide said was, &ldquo;But what will become of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yoshiki couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of having a band without Toshi (all of the songs were written solely for Toshi&rsquo;s voice), but he did entertain hide in looking for a new vocalist. I think they both knew it would be impossible for X to come back without Toshi.</p>

<p>Recently, I just watched their reunion video<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-786" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-786">3</a></sup>, and Toshi could barely keep himself together while singing their number one love song, <em>Forever Love</em>. The crowd would sing for him as he wept and he could barely play the chords and his voice kept cracking and it was honestly really hard to watch.</p>

<p>I hope he has forgiven himself by now.</p>

<p>But the tragedy and drama doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Toshi had been involved in an alleged cult which he just recently got out of, and his wife was living with the director (?) of said cult. He divorced his wife and is brankrupt due to the swindling of the cult. Wow. That&rsquo;s some intense stuff there.</p>

<p>Around the same time, the form bassist Taiji comitted suicide. He was arrested for alleged assault while on an airplane, and he hung himself in jail. He left the band a long time ago, but X JAPAN is still frequently attached to his name. It&rsquo;s sad because it seemed like he was getting his life back together, after years of abusing drugs and alcohol.</p>

<p>But I still love this band. It&rsquo;s weird though. Watching videos and casually listening to music and suddenly thinking, &ldquo;This person doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s worse when I listen to hide&rsquo;s solo music. I hear someone incredibly innovative and risk taking and it&rsquo;s just unsettling to think of the end that came to him.</p>

<p>Life is too short.</p>

          </div>

          <p><p>Since I gave up Tumblr for Lent, I realized how much free time I had on my hands without Tumblr. I decided, why not get back into TCGs? And so I did.</p>

<p>TCG stands for &ldquo;Trading Card Game.&rdquo; There are TCGs around the Internet that you can join as long as you yourself have a bit of space on the Internet. The goal of the game is basically to collect all the cards that are available in the game. They aren&rsquo;t like the strategy TCGs where players duel against each other (in other words, it&rsquo;s <strong>not like</strong> Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh!). However, you can trade cards with other players. To get cards, you have to play games like hangman, tic-tac-toe, etc. Some TCGs get really creative with the games but not all TCGs do.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the appeal of TCGs are. I don&rsquo;t even know how I got into TCGs in the first place!</p>

<p>The very first TCG I joined was called <em>Very Beauty</em>. The link is dead now and has been dead for quite a while. The site went on hiatus around the summer of 2012. It focused on Japanese music and entertainment. I mostly joined it for the music aspect. The cards I collected mostly were of rockers, haha. DIR EN GREY and L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel, were of course, my main priorities! Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t manage to master any decks while I was a part of that TCG.</p>

<p>Looking back on it now, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the card templates. It was so confusing as there were two different sizes for the cards. It made it easier to distinguish the different card types but at the same time, it looked like clutter! Below are some of the cards, that I managed to snag before the site closed down. The first one is of hide from X JAPAN, the second is of the music video LEECH by The Gazette, and lastly, is the beautiful Acchan from Perfume!</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>However, my favourite TCG is <a href="http://rapture.lightning-blade.net/">Rapture</a>. This TCG is themed around boy pairings in animanga and video games. I&rsquo;m actually not a huge fan of boy pairings, to be honest. It&rsquo;s weird, I know! The only two boy pairings that I ship are Oreki and Fukube from <em>Hyouka</em> and Kaworu and Shinji from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. But I joined this TCG anwyay. I just love the card templates! Rapture is definitely one of the prettiest TCGs out there right now.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m actually pretty decent with this TCG! I&rsquo;ve already mastered a couple of decks already. In fact, I think this is the only TCG where I have actually mastered any decks. Currently though, I&rsquo;m working to master the Kaworu x Shinji deck. I just recently finished Evangelion, so that&rsquo;s a fairly recent ship of mine.</p>

<p>But like, look at these cards&hellip; So pretty! Featuring Xanxus x Superbia Squalo from <em>Katekyo Hitman REBORN!</em>, Kaworu x Shinji from <em>NGE</em>, and Houtarou x Satoshi from <em>Hyouka</em>.</p>

</p>

<p>However, right now I&rsquo;m waiting on a Japanese music TCG. There&rsquo;s a couple that are inactive, which makes me sad! There are A LOT of Korean pop music TCGs floating around. I joined one of them. I don&rsquo;t even listen to that much K-Pop. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m mostly just collecting 2NE1, BIG BANG, AOA, Younha, and BoA decks right now. I also collect decks that have cute short haired girls in them. K-Pop girls are really cute, okay?</p>

          <p><p>Man, lately I&rsquo;ve just been scouring the Internet (okay, YouTube) for new music. I&rsquo;m so hungry for new music! Anyway, here are my findings.</p>

<p><strong>Buhar Jerreau</strong><br />
These guys are at the top of my list at the moment. They&rsquo;re a hip-hop/rap group of three guys from Kazakhstan. According to translations of their lyrics, I find them to be extremely talented at song writing. I really am in love with the beats of their songs (I don&rsquo;t know rap lingo&hellip;). They all just make me bob my head. <del>It helps that all of them are really attractive too.</del> From what I could find, they have a dozen or so songs released but not much.<br />
<strong>Favourite song(s):</strong> Мост<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-702">1</a></sup>, Текстиль<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-702">2</a></sup>, 498<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-702">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Yeng Constantino</strong><br />
She&rsquo;s definitely not new to me but my love her has rekindled in the form of this duet cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcXdxynVn80">Kahit Maputi Na Ang Buhok Ko</a> (Even Though My Hair is White). I really love Yeng&rsquo;s voic. So soft and pure. I suspect some autotune in this track though, but that&rsquo;s not to say <em>all</em> autotune is bad. We already know Yeng has a great voice, so it&rsquo;s no insult to her. But yes. Her voice in this song makes me melt. She recently got engaged (not to the dude in the video) so I feel like her feelings in singing this song was genuine.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Panginoon (Lord)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-702">4</a></sup>, Josephine<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_5-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_5-702">5</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>在日ファンク (Zainichi Funk/Japan Funk)</strong><br />
I have absolutely no idea how I stumbled across this band. Their a jazz/funk band from Japan. They get accussed of (I say accussed because it almost always has a negative connotation to it) of being a James Brown rip off. I personally have no problem with this because they are amazing. The live band with instruments are so top. The vocalist has a distinct voice and yeah, it&rsquo;s totally James Brown at times. If you watch performances, you can see the vocalist has moves. Man. Dude can dance!<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> 嘘 (Uso/Lie)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_6-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_6-702">6</a></sup>, 爆弾こわい (Bakudan Kowai/Scary Bomb) <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_7-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_7-702">7</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Predawn</strong><br />
Another musician from Japan. Apparently her name is Miwako Shimizu. She has a very soft crooning sort of voice that hipsters would absolutely love. I&rsquo;m no hipster but I&rsquo;m still super in love with her! She sings almost entirely in English, I think. Her voice is so soft that sometimes it can be hard to understand her but her accent sounds like it&rsquo;s English (as in London, England). It seems so fluent! And her lyrics are top notch too. Pretty much almost at Joanna Newsom&rsquo;s level of song writing.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Keep Silence<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_8-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_8-702">8</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Astrud Gilberto</strong><br />
A Brazilian bossa nova from the 60s. I absolutely love her voice. Like I said, I&rsquo;m not a musician but her voice at time sounds a bit monotone or flat but it still manages to bring a sense of personality into her music and creates a unique atmosphere. I love her voice and the songs she performs! She also has a cute accent. She was also pretty cute back in the day.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> How Insensitive<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_9-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_9-702">9</a></sup>, Fly Me to the Moon<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_10-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_10-702">10</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Hitomit Takahashi</strong><br />
Ugh, I forgot she existed! She did some theme songs for a couple of animes (Bokutachi wa no Yukue for Gundam SEED Destiny is the one that introduced me to her) but after I finished the anime, I barely touched any of her other songs. I was feeling nostalgic and decided to check out if she had new songs. She did! I barely recognized her, voice and face wise. She changed so much! Was Gundam SEED Destiny that old? Answer is kinda (10 years ago, wow).<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Wo Ai Ni<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_11-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_11-702">11</a></sup>, MUSIC<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_12-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_12-702">12</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>MEG</strong><br />
Last and certainly not least, is MEG. I love MEG. I&rsquo;m utterly in love with MEG. She&rsquo;s beautiful. She doesn&rsquo;t have a strong voice and usually relies on heavily mixed and autotuned songs but they&rsquo;re still catchy and great. There is something about her that captivates me. She knows she&rsquo;s cute and sexy and she owns it and she sells it. She&rsquo;s also a fashion designer and wow, her clothes are A+, I think (I don&rsquo;t know about fashiion, haha).<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> TRAP<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_13-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_13-702">13</a></sup>,WEAR I AM <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_14-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_14-702">14</a></sup></p>

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_1-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZK_8jh4ySo">x</a>] The music video is really well done. This is a song with a REALLY catchy beat. The chorus is really simplistic but it just hooks you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_1-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_2-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZjyRKFqi5s">x</a>] The comments on the video is all about T.O.P, lol. The main dude, I don&rsquo;t know their names yet, has a voice a lot like T.O.P&rsquo;s in this song. Another song with a catchy beat. I love the industrial booming sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_2-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_3-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeA22r9YnRQ">x</a>] This has like a mishmash of styles. It has a slight &ldquo;I Got a Boy&rdquo; feeling to it in terms of the mishmashing. I admit, my favourite part is at the end when the song is consumed by the melody. Gives me chills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_3-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_4-702"></a>[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOBm9MhdrL4">x</a>] Love how God fearing Yeng is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_4-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_5-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN_YQowvbUc">x</a>] Very innovative in terms of OPM music. None of the recycled ballad shtick. Very calm and relaxing as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_5-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_6-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq1nNykPCDQ">x</a>] Very calm and smooth. The vocalist may be trying too hard to be soft, his voice wavers a lot or is that intentional vibrato? I will never know because I&rsquo;m not a musician. Still love the song though.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_6-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>

    [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZK_8jh4ySo">x</a>] The music video is really well done. This is a song with a REALLY catchy beat. The chorus is really simplistic but it just hooks you.

    [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZjyRKFqi5s">x</a>] The comments on the video is all about T.O.P, lol. The main dude, I don't know their names yet, has a voice a lot like T.O.P's in this song. Another song with a catchy beat. I love the industrial booming sound.

          <p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I&rsquo;m not fluent in Tagalog but I am Filipino. English is my first language. This translation is improvised in some parts and relied heavily on Google Translate and my (very limited) existing knowledge of the language.</p>

<p>I love Yeng Constantino (Filipino singer). I put this song at the very front of my Filofax to remind me of two things: to be proud of being Filipino and to keep my mind focused on God. I find Yeng extremely inspiring. I honestly have a huge crush on her! She&rsquo;s beautiful, has an awesome voice, and has a strong faith in God. I hope you enjoy!</p>

          <p><p>AJ reminds me of Kemal. As much as I&rsquo;d hate to say it, that&rsquo;s the number one reason why I find AJ so attractive. He&rsquo;s like the Korean version of Kemal. Also, I&rsquo;d rather fangirl over AJ than be madly crushing on a guy who probably thinks I&rsquo;m an idiot and who I haven&rsquo;t seen in almost a year.</p>

<p>However, I saw Kemal on campus a while ago and I realized how much they don&rsquo;t really look like each other. Just the overall idea of their faces are similar. I think Kemal is more handsome while AJ is more pretty boy cute. They both have beautifully cheekbones though. :( I&rsquo;m a sucker for nice cheekbones&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably my memory being rusty but I feel like they have similar accents too. Kemal&rsquo;s accent is more Russian and thicker. But they sound very similar! When I watch their lips, they both make the same movements when they speak. It&rsquo;s freaky. I need to hang out with Kemal again to really get a good comparison of the two.</p>

<p>But seriously though. AJ is perfect.</p>
