<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is not a concert review and this post contains swearing</p>

<p>One of the things on my <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/25-before-25/">25 before 25 bucket list</a> was to go see a concert. The last concert I went to when I made my bucket list was the Japanese band <em>Lix</em> at an anime convention back in 2012 (but that slipped my mind when I wrote it and I said the last concert I went to was a <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/my-chemical-romance-in-concert/">My Chemical Romance concert</a>). Technically I already fulfilled this earlier in the year when I saw a video game cover band at the same anime convention but for some reason I don&rsquo;t really count that as a real concert.</p>

<p>However, this month I saw a bunch of concerts thanks to the Calgary Stampede&rsquo;s Coca-Cola Stage. Every year my city hosts a stage where musicians perform at for 10 days. Usually I skip out on it because I don&rsquo;t like any of the musicians that attend. However, this year they came out with the news that the bands Alexisonfire and Billy Talent were coming and I knew that I just had to go.</p>

<h2 id="alexisonfire">Alexisonfire</h2>

<p>I watched a lot of <em>Much Music</em> on TV as a kid, which is essentially Canada&rsquo;s equivalent of MTV. What I really liked about <em>Much Music</em> was that they featured a lot of Canadian artists and a lot of bands. I&rsquo;ve always been a rocker at heart and I was so glad that they were diverse and played bands alongside the more mainstream pop musicians. Now that I think about it, the mid/late 2000&rsquo;s seemed like a better time for bands but that&rsquo;s beside the point.</p>

<p>Every week there would be a countdown of that week&rsquo;s hits. Back in 2006, I distinctly remember watching Alexisonfire climbing the charts all the way up to number one with their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPcds3jOhRQ"><em>This Could be Anywhere in the World</em></a>. I tried to listen to their previous works but back then I had very little tolerance to screaming in songs and their newer songs were more melodic. Most of the songs that I liked by Alexisonfire was from their <em>Crisis</em> album.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2015 that I delved into their discography again. They somehow got on my recommended on YouTube and I was hit by nostalgia. My taste in music had definitely changed since 2006 and I found a new appreciation for both the screaming vocals and the clean vocals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of all the music I&rsquo;ve been listening to since the end of 2010 and you can really see that sudden 2015 spike. I was riding the Alexisonfire phase until about 2017. I think I would attribute the 2018 spike to the news that Alexisonfire was coming to my city, where I was just hyping myself up for my favourite songs and listening to more of their discography just in case they played any unfamiliar songs.</p>

<p>My friends and I ran up to the area where Alexisonfire was playing about an hour and a half before the concert started. I saw that they put up barriers pretty early. Initially I didn&rsquo;t know what the barriers were for but later I learned it was for keeping the mosh pit contained. So my friends and I were right up against the barrier before the crowd turned into the mosh pit section. We were fairly close to the stage but not quite enough for my short self to see past the sea of tall people.</p>

<p>That didn&rsquo;t matter too much to me. What I really came to hear was the music. I also really wanted to see George Petit (the screaming vocalist) in the flesh at least once.</p>

<p>They ended up playing a lot of my favourite songs (except for maybe two or three). They started off with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8nIv56qKhM"><em>Young Cardinals</em></a> which kicked things off really well. It was great whenever they handed off the singing to the crowd. It gave me goosebumps listening to everyone around me and barely myself singing along. It just got me hyped. Next, they did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgkMlEn8L2E"><em>Boiled Frogs</em></a>. This is one of my favourite singles from 2006.</p>

<p>One of George&rsquo;s strong points is hyping up the crowd. When they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6SK3CrVWko"><em>We Are the Sound</em></a> I screamed my heart out whenever George prompted the crowd to, &ldquo;repeat after me!&rdquo; Another example is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=993hs8m1J40"><em>Dog&rsquo;s Blood</em></a>, which isn&rsquo;t one of my favourite songs ever. I was reading people&rsquo;s comments about the concert after and one poster said at one point in the song, they learned over to their girlfriend and said to her, &ldquo;After this, George will say &lsquo;<em>Now fuck this place up</em>!&lsquo;&rdquo; He says that in every performance of <em>Dog&rsquo;s Blood</em> but I don&rsquo;t care, it&rsquo;s fucking hype anyway!</p>

<p>There were a couple of songs that they played that I wasn&rsquo;t too familiar with (<em>Crisis</em>, <em>Accept Crime</em>, <em>Drunks, Lovers, Sinners and Saints</em>) but those were still really great songs to just headbang and groove to.</p>

<p>Of course, they played <em>This Could Be Anywhere in the World</em> as their &ldquo;last&rdquo; song. It was absolutely amazing. That&rsquo;s hands down their most well-known song. The girl to my left was really quiet the entire concert but once this song started, she was just all into it. That&rsquo;s one of my favourite things about concerts: when everyone is just freaking out over really good songs by a really good band that they all love.</p>

<p>The encore was what got me the most though. Most notably, they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwXSwbX_NqI"><em>Pulmonary Archery</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ0Zncg7sLQ"><em>Accidents</em></a>. When I heard the opening riff of <em>Accidents</em>, I yelled &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; and threw my hand in the air. I don&rsquo;t know the lyrics to <em>Accidents</em> really well but I screamed my heart out to what I thought Dallas Green was singing. Right now I&rsquo;m listening to the song and just reliving it. I screamed &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s redefine&rdquo; so hard my throat started to hurt. That was the absolute highlight of the concert for me.</p>

<p>Even weeks later, I&rsquo;m still a little bit in a daze of seeing Alexisonfire live. I got to see George Petit&rsquo;s head pop a couple of times and saw him tear off his shirt. I saw Chris Steele briefly go across the stage deliriously. I witnessed a dude in a wheelchair crowd surfing. Wade McNeil yelled at some crowd surfer blocking the view of the stage and cemented the fact that he is probably the coolest and kindest dude in the band. It was just a whole lot of fun. I am still so extremely happy that I got to see them live.</p>

<h2 id="billy-talent">Billy Talent</h2>

<p>Billy Talent is a bit of a different story. At first I was a little bit hesitant to see Billy Talent because I&rsquo;m not a big Billy Talent fan. I also got into Billy Talent in 2006 so they still had a bit of a nostalgia factor to me. 2006 was when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv5kkI5X1QM">*Devil in a Midnight Mass</a> came out and I really liked that song. They came out with a lot of singles off their 2006 album <em>Billy Talent II</em> that I really liked. I also liked the singles off their previous self-titled <em>Billy Talent</em> album. However after that, Billy Talent fell off my radar and I just listened to those singles over and over again.</p>

<p>2006 was right around that middle school age and that was when I was probably at my edgiest. Billy Talent had a lot of relatable songs that are comparable to Linkin Park&rsquo;s songs in their hay day. That was a big reason why I was drawn to Billy Talent. I could emotionally connect to a lot of their songs.</p>

<p>You can see that in 2016 I only listened to two songs by Billy Talent. In 2016, Billy Talent came out with the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-3Ms3m34"><em>Afraid of Heights</em></a> and I decided to give it a listen. Evidently I didn&rsquo;t like it that much back then because I only listened to it once and to one other song from the album.</p>

<p>When I learned that Billy Talent was coming to Calgary, I decided to try to listen to more of their songs. I eventually grew to like <em>Afraid of Heights</em> and I rediscovered <strong>a lot</strong> of Billy Talent songs I used to love when I was younger.</p>

<p><strong>Compared to Alexisonfire</strong></p>

  </figure>
</div>


<p>For the first four years, I listened to just slightly more Billy Talent compared to Alexisonfire. I think this is because there were more songs I liked by Billy Talent. When it came to Alexisonfire, I only liked a couple of songs, maybe four at the most, but I played them a lot. Of course, 2015 changed how I listened to Alexisonfire.</p>

<p>2014 or 2015 was around when I started to use Spotify so I was listening less and less to my personal music library. I essentially rebuilt my music library from scratch through the Spotify catalogue. Billy Talent did not make the cut but Alexisonfire did.</p>

<p>Obviously, in 2018 pre and post-concert I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of Billy Talent. Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll be listening to Billy Talent more than Alexisonfire in the future.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much from the concert because I never saw myself as a big fan of Billy Talent. But I was <em>amazed</em> at how many songs I recognized at the concert. They played some of my favourite classics like <em>Devil in a Midnight Mass</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lc-mkZXPao"><em>The Ex</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPCMx8yS7c0"><em>Try Honesty</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8zR30qTd8Y"><em>River Below</em></a>. They also played some recent songs that I didn&rsquo;t really know but liked enough to headbang to.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNhPb_BPfLA"><em>This is How it Goes</em></a> is one of those songs that wasn&rsquo;t familiar with but when they played it, I just lost myself to the music. Later I found out this song was written after the drummer, Aaron Solowoniuk, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The song had a good amount of &ldquo;fuck it, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck anymore&rdquo; that resonated with me.</p>

<p>The encore was the real banger though. I can get why bands save the really good songs for the encore but damn. I am <em>so</em> happy they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2UktJtKpFw"><em>Red Flag</em></a>. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it but they did it! I screamed out the chorus every single time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg63uxYwN0"><em>Fallen Leaves</em></a> is another one of my favourites. I never saw it as a show closer but oh man, now I understand why they ended it with that song. It has a similar sentiment to Alexisonfire&rsquo;s <em>This Could be Anywhere in the World</em>, of being disgruntled about the place you currently live in and seeing nothing but corruption everywhere.</p>

<p>Ben, the vocalist for Billy Talent, made a really great effort to connect to the crowd. Like Alexisonfire, they commented about coming back to Calgary after so many years which was really nice to hear. Also similar to Alexisonfire, Ben stressed about being inclusive to everyone and had a spiel about loving everyone no matter their background.</p>

<p>Something that was pretty cool was that one of the sound technicians had a birthday that day and Ben passed a cake through the crowd from the front of the stage back to where the sound booth was. My friends and I watched the cake float through the crowd. One time the cake almost fell. I&rsquo;m glad the band trusted us with that cake.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an awesome concert. I screamed a lot more at that concert than the Alexisonfire concert, partly because Billy Talent songs are a lot more singable for someone who can&rsquo;t do screamo vocals. I feel a little unfair for comparing this concert to the Alexisonfire concert (one of my friends said he heard someone else talking about how &ldquo;Alexisonfire had way more people than this&rdquo;) especially when the two bands have the same touring drummer, Jordan Hastings. But these two bands were both prominent in my early life right around the same time. They really defined the Canadian rock landscape in the early/mid-2000&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s amazing that they can still draw huge crowds and are (in Billy Talent&rsquo;s case) making new music.</p>

<p>In the end, I enjoyed Billy Talent and Alexisonfire for different reasons. My junior high self would have loved seeing Billy Talent live. My current self is just so glad I got to see Alexisonfire. I am still grateful that I got to see both of them. I will hopefully never stop listening to these two bands. I think I will always be able to listen to my favourite songs and rock out to them.</p>

          <p><p>I have been following <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/">Justin Guitar</a>&#8216;s lesson plans for learning the guitar.</p>

<p>This week I went through the first 15 beginner&rsquo;s course lessons, BC-101 to BC-115. I learned the basics of choosing a guitar, posture, etc. In terms of actually playing, I learned the D chord, A chord, and E chord. The first two chords were incredibly &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; The chord that really stumped me was the E chord. I could not press down on the strings hard enough so that it didn&rsquo;t sound muted. It got easier in the middle of the week because my fingers hurt less from pressing down on the strings so often.</p>

<p>The lesson I&rsquo;m working on right now is trying to get the most chord changes in one minute. The idea is to aim for 30 changes in one minute. Speed is the main factor here and not so much how good it sounds.</p>

<p>Here are the results of my first two tries:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Chord</th>
<th>Round 1</th>
<th>Round 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>D chord &#8211; A chord</td>
<td>17 changes</td>
<td>27 changes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>D chord &#8211; E chord</td>
<td>21 changes</td>
<td>31 changes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>E chord &#8211; A chord</td>
<td>26 changes</td>
<td>30 changes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The next couple of lessons will be more chords, I predict. I&rsquo;m not quite sure. Hopefully I can stick to this for another week!</p>

          <p><p>Disclaimer: Lyrics relating to suicide is mentioned in this post.</p>

<p>Another disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not good at writing reviews but I do like expressing my opinions. This is in no way a professional review but rather how I personally feel about this album.</p>

<p>I know Marina and the Diamonds&rsquo; album <em>Electra Heart</em> is one of her personally least favourite works but I like it a lot. Many people think <em>Electra Heart</em> represents an alter-ego but it&rsquo;s rather a personality that Marina holds in disdain. I actually kinda love it. While some songs do resonate with my own personality, the overall theme of the corrupted American dream doesn&rsquo;t coincide with my reality. But you have to admit that there are some catchy tunes on this album.</p>

<p>The album starts off with <em>Bubblegum Bitch</em>, which I was really apprehensive about at first. It turned out to be a really high energy song with a fun and catchy chorus. The guitar ripping througg the song really made it for me. It added a certain ironic feel that set the tone for the rest of the album.</p>

<p>The much loved <em>Primadonna</em> comes right after. It&rsquo;s a little jarring to think about two different types of people as the topic one after the other (although, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive personalities). However, this was the song that got me sucked into Marina and the Diamonds. I hate to say it but Marina&rsquo;s voice is perfect for capturing the entitled persona in this song and I fall all over it. Even though you know she doesn&rsquo;t deserve anything good, you can&rsquo;t help but give it to her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not a huge fan of <em>Lies</em>. I like slower songs but I really hate that cheesy drum clap thing going on. It&rsquo;s not you, Marina, it&rsquo;s me.</p>

<p><em>Homewrecker</em> is a favourite of mine. I love the image a stereotypical American woman casually destroying marriages. Okay, that sounded bad. I don&rsquo;t condone that at all but I just find it amazing how well this song captures the stereotype. It&rsquo;s so easy to picture this person in your head.</p>

<p>The next track on the album is another one of my favourites: <em>Starring Role</em>. While thinking about this song, I realized how self centered all the songs on the album are so far and this is no exception. This song speaks about being the number one in someone&rsquo;s life and not willing to take second place. However, it&rsquo;s not as selfish as it sounds and I can sympathize with it. I also can overlook the cheesy clapping because I get chills whenever Marina sings &ldquo;The starring role.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will have to admit that I don&rsquo;t have any strong feelings for <em>The State of Dreaming</em>. I like how it picks up during the chorus and they way Marina sings &ldquo;My life is play&rdquo; but in between those moments, it&rsquo;s a little boring. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s a song that I would skip sometimes.</p>

<p><em>Power and Control</em> is true to its name and Marina&rsquo;s voice just exudes the song&rsquo;s theme. There&rsquo;s something about that booming voice that portrays confidence that the song calls for; someone ambitious who wants to get as much as possible with as little work as possible.</p>

<p>A lot of people seem to like <em>Teen Idle</em> a lot but I think this is one of my least favourite tracks on the album. The teen angst is just too much for me. Much of this album is over the top and extravagant but I can&rsquo;t seem to enjoy this. I find the song a little bit boring but I like the irony in how the line &ldquo;feeling super, super, super (super!) suicidal&rdquo; is executed in a cheery way. But this song doesn&rsquo;t jive with me at all.</p>

<p>The slow songs continue with <em>Valley of the Dolls</em>. While this isn&rsquo;t a super favourite, I don&rsquo;t mind this song much. I like the chorus a lot and the lyrics are pretty relatable. In my opinion, this song speaks of donning multiple personalities but ultimately not knowing who you really are at the core. It&rsquo;s a pretty dark and speaks of death. Death of another personality or the physical person, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>I understand that the album is essentially a concept album that is operatic and has a story arch in the fashion as Green Day&rsquo;s <em>American Idiot</em> but it&rsquo;s a little bit draining to have so many slow songs in a row. There are theories that this album&rsquo;s second half indicated the dying of the Electra Heart persona. This is not to say that <em>Hypocrates</em> isn&rsquo;t a good song but I prefer it when I&rsquo;m not listening to the album as a whole. I really like the mellow guitar and and the twinkling strings and Marina&rsquo;s voice taking a softer and less abrasive tone. This is another song that I don&rsquo;t mind much but don&rsquo;t like it enough to save it to my Spotify library.</p>

<p>The album finishes off with <em>Fear and Loathing</em> which marks the end of Electra Heart. I do not like this song much. However, I am impressed with Marina&rsquo;s higher register even if I still prefer when she reaches those lower notes. Conceptually, it isn&rsquo;t a bad way to end the album.</p>

<p>Overall, I drastically prefer the first half of the album. I like this album but it&rsquo;s not one I&rsquo;d go out of my way to buy but rather buy select songs off of it. The concept is interesting and Marina doesn&rsquo;t play around when it comes to her lyrics. It&rsquo;s pretty cohesive as a whole. I really admire Marina and I like how she is continually trying out different things. Let&rsquo;s see where she goes next with her music!</p>

          <p><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been using Spotify a lot. I only ever use it when I&rsquo;m at my computer. When I&rsquo;m on the go, I turn to my trusty iPod classic. Since I use the free version of Spotify (now that I have a job, I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m a broke college student anymore but I can say that I&rsquo;m still cheap), being able to choose what I listen to is a must and Spotify mobile doesn&rsquo;t have that ability. The contrast between the songs on my iPod and Spotify is staggering.</p>

<p>On my iPod, I have a bunch of foreign artists, mainly Japanese and Korean with a side of Taiwanese. If you look at my Spotify, it&rsquo;s mostly a bunch of really poppy Western mainstream music. I&rsquo;ve discovered a lot of new artists through Spotify simply because the Japanese catalogues on Spotify is sparse and I value accurate tagging (English translations of song titles vs. the original Japanese characters on the back of a CD) too much to listen to some of the Japanese music that is on Spotify.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s always a treat when I happen to get my hands on an iTunes gift card (remember, I said I&rsquo;m cheap). Except it&rsquo;s also hard trying to figure out what I want to buy with it because I can only choose the best. I only managed to squeeze out 9 songs from my $10 gift card but it&rsquo;s like 35 minutes worth of music so $0.28 cents per minute? I actually have no idea if that&rsquo;s a good amount or not.</p>

<p>On to what I bought!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>E is For Estranged by Owen Pallett</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t discover Owen Pallett from Spotify (my ex introduced me to him) but I did discover this song on Spotify! Even though the storyline of the song doesn&rsquo;t relate to me at all, I associate this song with myself as my name starts with E. There&rsquo;s something incredibly nostalgic about this song with a dash of good old melancholy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Icarus, Bint Elkhandaq, and Maghawir by Mashrou&rsquo; Leila</strong></p>

<p>When I used to be obsessed with TCGs, I was inspired for a couple of months to make a TCG of my own: an Asian music inspired TCG. Except I was determined to include Asian countries that weren&rsquo;t just Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. On my search, I came across Lebanese based alternative band Mashrou&rsquo; Leila. They were more secular than I expected with songs covering topics such as homosexuality, clubbing, and politics but I mostly fell in love with their catchy tunes! Their latest album (which all three of these song are from) is a bit more on the poppy side but I honestly love the entire album so just picking a few songs to buy was difficult.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Let Me Go! feat. Sophie Hunger by Erik Truffaz 4tet</strong></p>

<p>I stumbled onto this song purely by chance, thanks to Mashrou&rsquo; Leila. The lead singer of Mashrou&rsquo; Leila performed a cover of this song from Erik Truffaz 4tet. I was enchanted by it and hurried to listen to the original. Hearing it being sung in English hit me hard. Sophie Hunger has a perfect voice for this song. It has a sense of longing to break free that she captures perfectly.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Paris is Burning and All My Stars Aligned by St. Vincent</strong></p>

<p>I had heard of St. Vincent before but wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what she was about. I <em>think</em> she came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify one day and and according to my Last.fm, it was most likely <strong>Paris is Burning</strong>. The song was unbelievably quirky and I fell in love instantly. It took me a couple of months to listen to the rest of the <strong>Marry Me</strong> album and <strong>All My Stars Aligned</strong> was one of the songs that resonated with me. It was an obvious jab at people who turn to superstitions (astrology, palm reading, etc.) which I sometimes dabble in but I loved it so much. Also St. Vincent is an absolutely beautiful human being.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Human Sadness by Julian Casablancas + The Voidz</strong></p>

<p>This song I know for sure came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify. I had been listening to some of Julian&rsquo;s tracks from his solo album <strong>Phrazes for the Young</strong> for a bit up to that point. When I heard <strong>Human Sadness</strong>, it hit all the right buttons with me and I knew I had to know more about this Julian dude. Long 10 minute epic? Check. Grungy lo-fi vibe? Check. Cool guitar riffs? Check. Depressing song title? Check. Depressing song lyrics? Check. Although once I learned the lyrics, some of the impact the song had on me was a little reduced but there are some gems. &ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s a skull, I think it&rsquo;s grinning&rdquo; is one of them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>You Only live Once by The Strokes</strong></p>

<p>The original YOLO. Okay, when I found out Julian Casablancas was the lead singer of The Strokes, my mind was blown. I immediately dived in head first into their music after finding this out. Okay, I&rsquo;m still on their first album and last EP but there is a lot to digest. <del>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, part of the reason why I love this song is because Julian is so damn beautiful in the music video.</del> Something about this song makes me want to get up and dance, strangely enough. I also can&rsquo;t resist singing along to this song. It&rsquo;s so British rock that I would have totally thought they were British if I didn&rsquo;t know any better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Songs that I totally want to buy next time:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cool by Gwen Stefani</strong></p>

<p>I went through a really weird and brief Gwen Stefani phase earlier in the year. I don&rsquo;t know how it came about. I remember seeing this music video on Much Music and dismissing it as Gwen acting all sexy in a luxurious mansion but now what I get from it is that Gwen is gorgeous is a brunette. Okay, I did get more out of it. It&rsquo;s actually quite a mature song when I think about it. It takes a lot to look back at a past relationship (that first love you thought that you would marry, at that) and fully accept that you&rsquo;ve both moved on while still being close friends. I&rsquo;m a bit of a romantic in that way, I guess.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Cruel by St. Vincent</strong></p>

<p>My love for this woman is neverending. The guitar solo isn&rsquo;t long at all but it&rsquo;s the highlight of the song, in my opinion. I love how St. Vincent tackles the subject of the unappreciated parental figure. Also, props to St. Vincent for using gender neutral language (she refers to this unappreciated person as &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; throughout the song).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Galaxy by LADIES&rsquo; CODE</strong></p>

<p>This song is sexy. I can&rsquo;t say more about it, unfortunately, haha! This is a Korean girl group which I found on Spotify, which is a little rare for me. I like this song a lot.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Utada Hikaru&rsquo;s new album!!!!!!!</strong></p>

<p>I was tempted to spend all $10 on this album but I decided against it as the songs I&rsquo;ve listened to on the album I already own. I want a more concrete opinion of the album before I buy it. The teaser for the Shiina Ringo collaboration was so tempting. But I like making informed buying decisions. I know I won&rsquo;t be disappointed since it&rsquo;s Utada Hikaru, but still.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unrequited Love by CAPSULE</strong></p>

<p>While on my latest trip to the Philippines, I listened to <em>WAVE</em> <em>RUNNER</em> multiple times on the plane there. A lot of people complain about how Western the album is. EDM and dubstep is horrible. Toshiko doesn&rsquo;t sing much. Blah, blah, blah&hellip; I personally found the album to be pretty good. Honestly, I dismiss comments that complain of foreign music being &ldquo;too Western.&rdquo; In my mind it implies a weird exoticizing take on foreign music. Anyway, I really like this song, despite not being heavy into electronic music. Toshiko has great lines.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls by The Weekend</strong></p>

<p>The earlier works of The Weekend are intoxicating. Seriously, The Weekend&rsquo;s super clean vocals mixed with the heavy beats make for songs that make you feel like you&rsquo;re on a trip (is that how the kids say it nowadays). This song is just intoxicating in a seductive way.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Primadonna by Marina and the Diamonds</strong></p>

<p>Marina is HOT. Her Electra Heart era reawakened my hidden feelings for Vanessa Hudgens (you can&rsquo;t deny that Marina looks at least a little like Vanessa!). But yeah, there&rsquo;s something really attractive about her Electra Heart persona. It&rsquo;s a shame that she doesn&rsquo;t view the era as a great period in her career because I love it. Primadonna is like a rich spoiled girl anthem and I can&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Divers by Joanna Newsome</strong></p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t believe I forgot about this song. Unfortunately, Joanna doesn&rsquo;t have her music on Spotify so unless I&rsquo;m on YouTube, I don&rsquo;t listen to this song. Which is a great reason why I need this song! I think I&rsquo;ve written about <em>Divers</em> before but I will reiterate once again that I am IN LOVE with Joanna. She&rsquo;s extremely polarizing. You either kiss the earth she walks on or think her voice is like nails on chalkboard. This is a masterpiece and I love her. I totally regret not buying this now. Damn, how could I forget this song?</p></li>

          <p><p>Ugh I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had a dream where I literally just lived out my entire day, down to sitting in lecture being bored and taking notes.</p>

<p>You don’t even know how disappointed I am when I woke up knowing that I had to do it all over again.</p></li>

<li><p>I’m using emacs via SSH for my CS assignment and the backspace key doesn’t mean backspace, the del key means backspace AND I KEEP HITTING BACKSPACE. I’m so frustrated. I don’t want to change the settings either because what if I do something I shouldn’t do because I’m on my university&rsquo;s servers.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes I like to think that my faith in humanity is so strong that I can leave my stuff anywhere at the university without asking anyone to watch it but I just really don’t want to talk to people.</p></li>

<li><p>so I just listened to DIR EN GREY’s new single. Sustain the Untruth. Hmm. I think it will grow on me. I like the intro and outro (dat bass), the synth, and all that typical Kyo vocals (he sounds so sinister, wow, I&rsquo;m not surprised though). The chorus sounds a bit out of place to me. Overall it’s okay but I think it’s kinda anticlimatic.</p>

<p>BUT OMG. RUTEN NO TOU ACOUSTIC VERSION. That’s some godly music right there. But back to STU. the music video is also kinda lack lustre. How did the deg shoutbox put it? Kyo is like a zombie mary magdalene I don’t understand.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday I was mailing stuff (now three months ago) and there’s this guy at the mall who works at the knives store and he has a sweet mohawk. I was sitting nearby putting stamps on envelopes and an old lady asked him if she could touch his hair. it was kinda cute but at the same time I wonder if he was annoyed but he sounded really cheerful so I guess not?</p></li>

<li><p>The best thing about Lindsay having a tumblr though is when she reblogs posts about Michael or about her and Michael and kinda fangirls over it. She’s like living the ultimate fangirl dream like, &ldquo;You see the person in this post? I’m getting married to this guy.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>I feel so happy for recognizing Rie Fu’s voice but it’s only because she sang in really fluent English. Hourou Musuko is the sweetest anime I have ever watched. Yeah, it’s a slice of life school anime but I really love how it treated the LGBTQ issues. It all seems so perfect though. If only more people facing those issues received the support the characters did. And if only people reacted the way the characters did. Wow, so sweet.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-809" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-809">1</a></sup></p></li>
