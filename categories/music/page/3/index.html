              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>It&rsquo;s no secret to many people that L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is my favourite band. No, not one of my favourite bands, but my <strong><em>favourite</em></strong> band. Previously, my favourite band had been Green Day, from about grade four to junior high school. They were a great band for me at the time but they didn&rsquo;t have a timeless feel to them. After listening to L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel, I quickly dumped them.</p>

<p>When I was in junior high I even wrote an essay about how L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel had impacted my life. My teacher loved it and even read it out loud for the class. Thank gosh that was an elective class that comprised mostly of friends or acquaintances. I so wish I still had that essay!</p>

<p>Basically, my journey with L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel started, like for many people, with the anime Full Metal Alchemist. <em>Ready, Steady, Go!</em> was one of the opening theme songs to Full Metal Alchemist. I didn&rsquo;t like it as much, to be honest. The vocalist<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-111">1</a></sup> had a really low voice that I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of.</p>

<p>Then I watched Full Metal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shambala. I thought it was a great movie. The opening for the movie was <em>Link</em> and the ending was <em>Lost Heaven</em>. I loved those two songs so much after listening to them just once that I went ahead and downloaded most of L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel&rsquo;s discography. I fell in love with them and loved everything they did.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone in and out of being obsessed with L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel. These days I definitely do not listen to them as much as I used to but I still listen to them a lot. Every time I listen to one of their songs, I just feel this weird calm come over me and I feel immersed in the music. It&rsquo;s almost like I&rsquo;m falling in love with them all over again each time. Their songs just never seem to get old<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-111">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel songs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Forbidden Lover</strong><br />
By far my favourite song, ever. It just has a haunted and powerful sound. Utterly tragic and beautiful. Every member shines, even if I can&rsquo;t hear the bassist<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-111">3</a></sup> 90% of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Link</strong><br />
That song I talked about earlier? An oldie but a goodie. I used to get choked up listening to this song. Now? Not so much. Granted, I do feel a bit emotional when I listen to it. I think it&rsquo;s the nostalgia factor.</li>
<li><strong>Time Goes On</strong><br />
One of the really singable songs. I think this song just represents a really great era for the band. It&rsquo;s not hard core but not mellow either. I think Hyde&rsquo;s vocals really stand out in this one.</li>
<li><strong>All Dead</strong><br />
This song is older than I am<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-111">4</a></sup> but I find it to be a classic. In the band&rsquo;s beginning, their sound was <em>very</em> Spanish rock. I just fell in love with the guitar in this song. It gets in my head and it does this weird thing to my emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Niji</strong><br />
This is a classic song. Apparently most of their concerts end with this song and I can see why. It sounds like a plea or a very heartbroken goodbye. The vocals are very powerful and almost on the brink of screaming while still sounding beautiful. The song just jumps right in and you&rsquo;re immediately hit with these emotions.</li>
<li><strong>4th Avenue Cafe</strong><br />
One of those carefree songs that I really like! I alway want to jump or dance or just sing along whenever I listen to this. It just makes me so <em>happy</em>. At the same time, it also makes me emotional! It&rsquo;s just another one of those trademark L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel songs that you listen to and you just feel like, &ldquo;Without this song, L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel would not be L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Reaction blog posts are probably not blog posts at all but rather, a mass wall of incoherent garble of text. This probably belongs on something like Tumblr but it was too long and you know Tumblr kids. There are <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> spoilers (yeah, you read that right, and FOR ALL OF THE GAMES too) and obviously, <em>The Afterman: Ascension</em> spoilers ahead. Tread carefully. I&rsquo;ve probably scared everyone away anyhow, haha.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of <a href="http://mspaintadventures.com">Homestuck</a>. It&rsquo;s basically a online web comic that follows the crazy video game adventures of these kids. I can&rsquo;t exactly describe it without spoiling major aspects but oh my goodness gravy, it is probably one of the most entertaining and time consuming things in the world.</p>

<p>The reason why I bring this up is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to get my friend to read Homestuck, but he has been hesitant to do so. So we struck a deal. I buy the latest <strong>Coheed and Cambria</strong> album, and then he&rsquo;ll read Homestuck. I finally bought it today. My bus stop is literally beside a Wal-Mart so it wasn&rsquo;t a major inconvenience. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to have it for a while anyway because I&rsquo;ve recently made a pact to <del>cut down</del> stop downloading music because all of the bands I listen to deserve all of my money.</p>

<p>So yes, I bought <em>The Afterman: Ascension</em> today. I just unwrapped the plastic and now it&rsquo;s sitting before me on the desk. It&rsquo;s a wonderful case. It&rsquo;s not like your typical CD jewel case, it&rsquo;s a cardboard tri-fold thing. The cover features amazing artwork of The Afterman being &ldquo;split by the entities&rdquo; as lead singer, Claudio has described it in his many video logs about the album. I actually have no idea what these &ldquo;entities&rdquo; are. Coheed and Cambria have a tendency to create a story line with their music and I unfortunately don&rsquo;t really follow it. It&rsquo;s an amazing concept just one that I don&rsquo;t indulge in. Anyway, more about the case.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tri-fold kind of thing. Once you open it halfway, the CD is there and the Afterman logo. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what to call it but it looks absolutely stunning. Open it up again, and there&rsquo;s even more beautiful artwork. It&rsquo;s very abstract and eerie, I love it so much! Also, there&rsquo;s a flap inside that holds the lyric booklet. Even the lyric booklet is beautiful. The lyrics are paired up with their respective artwork. The page with the lyrics on them is so pleasing to look at. Beautiful serif font bordered with simple grey. The colour scheme is absolutely lovely as well. Orange and blue, my favourite colour combination!</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve listened to three of the tracks on this album. They&rsquo;ve all been extremely different from each other so I&rsquo;m interested in how the album will sound like. I have no clue right now. <em>Domino</em> was released as a single (?) or at least, as a music video. It. Was. Amazing. Probably one of the best Coheed songs out there (you can read more on how I feel about it <a href="http://musical.brokenphrases.info/2012/09/three-songs-ive-been-playing-on-repeat/">here</a>). <em>Holly Wood</em> was leaked and I <del>was forced to listen to it by my friend</del> listened to it and I was also quite impressed. Lastly, <em>The Afterman</em>. At first I wasn&rsquo;t too taken by it but as soon as I watched the lyric video posted on Coheed&rsquo;s YouTube channel, I loved it right away.</p>

<p>Now onto listening to the album. I&rsquo;m actually kinda scared for some reason but I&rsquo;m also bursting with excitement.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Okay so it literally just took me a minute to try to get the disk out, I fail at these kind of things. I was scared of snapping the disk or something like that. How horrible would that be? Okay, don&rsquo;t think about something as blasphemous as that. Now onto the listening for real this time.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Hollow (2:11)</strong></p>

<p>Woah beautiful piano intro thing. Impresseeeed. Wow. Wowowowow. All these layers of sound go beautifully together. Ah, there&rsquo;s some spoken words. I&rsquo;m kinda freaked out.</p>

<ul>
<li>I just had goosebumps. There&rsquo;s a conversation between who I&rsquo;m guessing is the Afterman and this so called, &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; The voice of the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; is extremely haunting. It&rsquo;s really distorted, sounding female but with a layer of a male voice. The last few seconds is just one note struck and some clattering of some sort. Then it&rsquo;s slowly building up to Domino.
Okay reaction time. Wow. That was&hellip; Entrancing. Simple of course, seeing as it&rsquo;s just an intro but still entrancing. I still have goosebumps. To be honest, as soon as I heard the voice of the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; I thought of Minvera and Juno from the <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> series. Some weird god and alien-like entity with the same kind of distortions, wow it&rsquo;s just so creepy and so good at the same time. At the end of the song, you can here the song swell and just build up to Domino and wow I&rsquo;m so impressed right now, yes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Key Extraction I: Domino the Destitue (7:51)</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already stated my feelings for this song (<a href="http://musical.brokenphrases.info/2012/09/three-songs-ive-been-playing-on-repeat/">over here</a>) but I&rsquo;ll repeat myself anyway. Wow. This song. WOOOOOW. I love it. Nearly 8 minutes of yummy Coheed goodness. Even though it&rsquo;s nearly 8 minutes, it definitely does not seem like it at all. Okay time to actually listen to this song with awesome CD quality.</p>

<p>THOSE GUITARS. HNNG. The quality is so top notch, I can&rsquo;t even. A huge grin is on my face right now. The little riff in the beginning is beautiful because of the slight echo it&rsquo;s amazing. OH GOD. CLAUDIO&rsquo;S VOICE. THE WORST IN EVERYBODY&rsquo;S EYES. GOOD BAD UGLY OR OTHERWISE. There&rsquo;s so much right with this song. It&rsquo;s hard to focus on one element of the song because beautiful sounds are coming from everywhere. OHHH. YOU THINK THEY&rsquo;D HAVE IT ALL WHILE YOU WERE LEFT WITH NOTHING. YOU&rsquo;VE MADE YOUR BED SO SOFT AND COMFORTING. Right now I&rsquo;m just singing along, haha. This is toooooo good. I IMPLORE BROTHER DON&rsquo;T WALK AWAY DON&rsquo;T WALK AWAY FROM ME. &#8216;CAUSE THIS IS OUR WAAAAR. Seriously, the quality of this is top notch ugh almost perfect. YOUR TIME HAS COME IT&rsquo;S NOW OR NEVER. WE MADE OUR BEDS. TO LIE IN THEM PROUD. THIS WARRING KNIFE THE FLASH OF BLADE. DON&rsquo;T WALK AWAY. DON&rsquo;T WALK AWAY FROM ME. &#8216;CAUSE THIS IS OUR WAAAR. ONE BY ONE. WE ARE TOGETHER. WE FALL TOGETHER. ONE BY ONEEEE. BROTHER DON&rsquo;T BE AFRAID.</p>

<p>Wonderful climax for this song, I can&rsquo;t even. Ugh this song is so perfect why why why why why why.</p>

<p><strong>3. The Afterman (3:11)</strong></p>

<p>This song was apparently written for Chondra, Claudio&rsquo;s wife. She had lost a friend and was feeling extremely down about it. When I first listened to this song I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed but when I watched the lyric video and saw the lyrics for the first time, I fell in love. I too know the pain of losing a friend and it just struck a chord with me and I was reduced to tears. Whenever I listen to this song, I feel strangely comforted but that feeling of loss is still there. I just love this song to bits. Love, love, love, love it.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the song is perfect. <em>She gave her heart. To a falling star. Around the declines. As the tears from her eyes fall. No one understands and no one will. If he&rsquo;s not here then where? If he&rsquo;s not here then where?</em> Goosebumps. <em>Your selfishness has robbed you of the man you could have been. I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing about you. I love you dearly, my friend.</em> Tears. Tears everywhere. <em>My love, I&rsquo;ve been searching for my afterman.</em></p>

<p>This is surprisingly short, a bit disappointed about that but still good nevertheless.</p>

<p><strong>4. Mothers of Men (4:11)</strong></p>

<p>Woah. That first note. Woah. That bass. Oh damn, that bass. The atmosphere of this song is completely sinister. I love it. The guitar seems to be mirroring Domino in a way. I love that backing vocals. The smooth ring sounds beautiful against Claudio&rsquo;s. Oh god. When the instruments suddenly stop or drop in volume and Claudio is just singing, woah. I haven&rsquo;t written much about this song. I think it&rsquo;ll have to grow on me. But oh. Oh my. It&rsquo;s good. There&rsquo;s tapping? I&rsquo;m kinda freaked out. And now a weird din. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit.&rdquo; Lol what. What?? The din is growing louder and louder and man just said, &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; Goosebumps, I tell you. GOOSEBUMPS.</p>

<p><strong>5. Goodnight, Fair Lady (3:23)</strong></p>

<p>This one feels very familiar. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on it. This is so good though. Kinda sounds. I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it. It seems very much like a happier tune. I like it. Catchy. I want to dance along to it actually, which is weird. I&rsquo;m seriously liking this, wow. GOODNIGHT GOODNIGHT FAIR LADY. I&rsquo;M A SNAKE WAITING FOR YOU, DEAR. I KNOW YOU WELL. The little piano lift thing seemed out of the place though. Even more clattering, what is this?? &ldquo;Caution: Second Identity Identified&rdquo; WTF SO CREEPY SO MINERVA/JUNO LIKE OMG.</p>

<p><strong>6. Key Entity Extraction II: Holly Wood the Cracked (3:26)</strong></p>

<p>Oh man. OH MAN. This one is a good one. Sooo sinister is the first few seconds. It&rsquo;s almost sinful. This one was leaked. Glad to hear it in awesome quality. Claudio is sooo sinister as fuck in this, fuck. HOLLY WOOD HOLLY WOOD. WATCH OUT HERE SHE COMES. I really like the clean part in this song. The chorus is beautiful. Claudio&rsquo;s voice sounds best clean. SHE&rsquo;S SHORT A FEW CARDS OF A FULL DECK. A JOKER IN THE GAME. POOR HOLLY WOOD. POOR HOLLY WOOD. I love how Claudio belts out &ldquo;poor Holly Wood.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Holly&rdquo; is just wonderful. It kinda sounds like he&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;Holly Word&rdquo; though, haha. Woah. Nanananana. That part. Awesome. Awesooome.</p>

<p>Damn. More creepy ass ambiance. Echoing voice. Distortion. Holy fuck. wHAT IS HAPPENING.</p>

<p><strong>7. Key Entity Extraction III: Vic the Butcher (5:47)</strong></p>

<p>Love this one so far. Much more aggressive than Holly Wood. And raw as well. Claudio&rsquo;s voice is shining with the echoing. A lot more shouting in this one. Holy crap, the backing vocals. &ldquo;LALALALA&rdquo; woah. I&rsquo;m liking this one but it seems to be taking forever. HANG EM UP, HANG EM UP NOW. Woah half way through the song. WHAT. IS. THIS. BEAUTIFUL. SOUND. I like this one but it&rsquo;s gonna take some time for sure.</p>

<p>Now for more ambiance. It&rsquo;s so freaky. I&rsquo;m kinda freaked out. So freaked out. ASSASSIN&rsquo;S CREED SOBS. How many entities are there I know it says it but still.</p>

<p><strong>8. Key Entity Extraction IV: Evagria the Faithful (6:22)</strong></p>

<p>Woah this one is sounding cool. Awesome intro for this song. Do-bopping going on. And Claudio&rsquo;s clean vocals. Woah. The first bang of drums. Oh man. OHHHH MAN. GOOD BYE FOREVER. Woah. Woah. I like this. I have been hit with so much awesomeness that I can&rsquo;t even form correct words. THIS HURT WON&rsquo;T, WON&rsquo;T GO AWAY. Wow. That is like a weird chant. I love it. YOU WON&rsquo;T BE FORGOTTEEEEEEN. Wow that note Claudio hangs on to, I keep replaying it. The chanting. The atmosphere is just so cool and mysterious and jungle-like. I like it. I love it. Someone please. Oh.</p>

<p><strong>9. Subtraction (3:07)</strong></p>

<p>This one is sounding very electronic. Wow. Lower voice Claudio. Almost doesn&rsquo;t sound like it. This is totally a love song of sorts. Okay, break up song actually, welp. SUBTRACT ME FROM YOUR HEART. Wow. This is wonderful. Acoustic with these weird beeping sounds. ONE STEP AT A TIME. I really like this. Although Claudio&rsquo;s end notes are bothering me. And the off tune (?) twangs of the guitar. So good though.</p>

<p>THIS ALBUM. GETS AN <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> JK I&rsquo;M NOT RATING IT AT ALL. But this album is crazy good. So far my only favourites are the ones that I have already listened to before but that will soon change. Now I&rsquo;m off to do my many, many, many assignments, haha. </p></p>

          </div>

          <p><p>These past two months or so have been great for new music. G-Dragon&rsquo;s comeback and news of Coheed and Cambria&rsquo;s new album. So many good things are happening! Lately, there has been three songs that I&rsquo;ve been playing over and over again.</p>

<div class="left">
  <div class="picture" style="width:322px;">
    <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9mm9c6ufp1qarjfpo1_500.gif"><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9mm9c6ufp1qarjfpo1_500.gif" width="322" height="184" alt="That XX" /></a><br />A gif made by <a href="http://vitadolce-moderato.tumblr.com/">vitadolce-moderato</a>.
  </div>
</div>

<p>The first one worth mentioning is G-Dragon&rsquo;s new ballad, <strong><a href="http://musical.brokenphrases.info/2012/09/three-songs-ive-been-playing-on-repeat/www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHQNYvaZnnY">That XX</a></strong>. For those who don&rsquo;t know, G-Dragon is a South Korean artist part of the boy group BIG BANG. I loved <strong>That XX</strong> the moment I saw a gif of it on Tumblr. As soon as I did see the gif, I went straight to YouTube. I was not expecting a ballad from G-Dragon, to be honest. His last single release was <strong>One of a Kind</strong> and just by reading the title, you can tell immediately that it was one of those obnoxious arrogant songs that artists like to create these days.</p>

<p><strong>That XX</strong> strongly contrasts <strong>One of a Kind</strong>. It&rsquo;s mostly just G-Dragon&rsquo;s sweet voice singing accompanied by an acoustic guitar. Definitely not a song to dance wildly to at parties. It&rsquo;s really bittersweet, telling the tale of a love triangle. G-Dragon just sounds so sincere in his singing and vulnerable, I love it. The lyrics are extremely relatable, however, nothing too heart wrenching.</p>

<p>Next up is a cover by YouTube user, Joel (<a href="http://youtube.com/Jbry2k8">Jbry2k8</a>), of the song <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZf4G0FGiNs">Smile</a></strong> originally by the Japanese band Monkey Majik. Just a bit of background on Monkey Majik, they&rsquo;re a Japanese-Canadian band. Two members are brothers and hail from Canada, and the other two (or three?) are Japanese. Fun fact, Blaise Plant (the bassist) went to Alberta for university, at University of Lethbridge. I&rsquo;m still wondering why people from Ontario would go all the way to Alberta for university, and to U of L at that. I have a two friends who go there actually but still. U of L? Well, I won&rsquo;t judge too much.</p>

<p>Back to the song, this is wonderful. A bit pitchy at times, but still wonderful. I&rsquo;m absolutely in love with Joel&rsquo;s voice. He has sort of a raspy down to earth tone that is just so, <em>wow</em>. The song just fits his voice perfectly as well. It almost seems as if it was made for him. <strong>Smile</strong> is another acoustic song, sung entirely in English. The lyrics are beautiful and they really resonate with me. It kinda inspires me in a way. I just love the chorus. <em>I caught a bolt of lightning, put it in my pocket as a good luck charm. And then I started thinking, maybe this piece of fire will protect me from harm.</em> Is that not beautiful? Although, I wish some of the mixing was done better. There are some times when Joel&rsquo;s voice is louder than other times and it slightly annoys me but eh.</p>

<p>Last and certainly not least is Coheed and Cambria&rsquo;s new song, <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRoN4_kG6XM">Domino the Destitute</a></strong>. Oh. My. Gulay. This song is easily my favourite song of the year (so far anyway, as I&rsquo;m still waiting for DIR EN GREY&rsquo;S new single, RINKAKU, to be released this December). I&rsquo;ve almost forgotten how much I love Coheed and Cambria. My friend made me a huge fan of them like two or three years ago. And oh goodness, there is no Coheed song that I do not LOVE. For instance, their album <em>Good Apollo I</em> (shortened of course) is a godsend. I love every single song on the album. I sing along to them every time. They&rsquo;re just that good.</p>

<p>This song. Oh, this song. <strong>Domino the Destitute</strong> is wonderful. It&rsquo;s around 8 minutes long and you wouldn&rsquo;t tell at all. The lead singer, Claudio Sanchez, is an amazing song writer and vocalist. His range is absolutely beautiful and oh I cannot even begin to describe my love for this song. There&rsquo;s an intense sound to it, it&rsquo;s just perfect in all aspects. The guitar work is pretty amazing and me oh my, nothing is out of place. Nothing. Clean, sharp, beautiful. So catchy, so amazing. I swear I&rsquo;m not a Coheed fangirl, I am far from it. It gets better every time I listen to it. Ugh. Just take my word for it when I say it&rsquo;s a great song.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just so you all know, I waded through 7000+ forums posts to find all the YouTube links I wanted to post here. Then I realized I could have used the search function. OTL Anyway, on to the post. Warning, there&rsquo;s a lot here. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d want to read it all but yeah.</p>

<p><span id="more-259"></span></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the weird part of YouTube. Well, not really. The weirdest thing I&rsquo;ve seen is probably the Obscure music video by DIR EN GREY. My mind is seriously boggled at how such a thing is allowed to exist on YouTube but I&rsquo;m glad it does or I would have never been able to bask in DIR EN GREY&rsquo;s glorious music. It&rsquo;s actually pretty surprising at all the different things you can find on YouTube. People from all of the world (minus North Korea and some of C, haha&hellip; Oh, that&rsquo;s not funny) posting videos and watching videos and commenting on videos. It&rsquo;s kinda crazy once you think about it. Just the Internet in general is a concept that I find hard to wrap my head around.</p>

<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m in a roleplaying guild on Neopets. Roleplaying? Guilds? Neopets? Ugh, I&rsquo;m so lame. But yeah. We&rsquo;re not so international. In fact, I&rsquo;m the only one who doesn&rsquo;t live in the US. And I don&rsquo;t live in some exotic foreign place, I live in Canada. Even so, we have such diverse tastes, especially in music. I&rsquo;ve only been part of the guild for two to three weeks, and I&rsquo;ve encountered many different songs and different genres and it&rsquo;s all just great.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve been going out of my genre boundaries and listening to other stuff. There&rsquo;s just so much out there! So, I&rsquo;m going to share my discoveries.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=8tJU9w6_YkI">Rich Fantasy Lives as performed by Rob Balder, Tom Smith &amp; Will Frank</a></strong></p>

<p>Okay, the guild member who recommended this has the coolest music taste ever. I&rsquo;d probably would have never listened to this if I saw the thumbnail. Three average looking middle aged men singing about fantasy worlds? Doesn&rsquo;t seem like my thing. It still really isn&rsquo;t my thing, but the tune of this song is just catchy. Simple, yes, but catchy. It&rsquo;s like a fairytale story you tell your kid but in song form. Very cute.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=8We3xnTmVaA">Trophy by Bat For Lashes</a></strong></p>

<p>Hauntingly beautiful. I don&rsquo;t want to say it&rsquo;s primitive or basic because it is and isn&rsquo;t at the same time. I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe it. It&rsquo;s just great. Hypnotizing. Lulling. Comforting. I don&rsquo;t even know. I wish I knew more musical terms.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoPplpBPQxQ">Technologic by Daft Punk</a></strong></p>

<p>This is definitely not a new discovery, but rather, a rediscovery. Daft Punk. Guhhh. The sounds this duo brings is seriously out of this world. It&rsquo;s almost hard to believe that this music wasn&rsquo;t made too long ago. I feel like I&rsquo;ve grown up with this song. As for the music video&hellip; I&rsquo;m reminded of Furbies that were skinned of their synthetic fur.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUJXJcQDC_s">Innocence by Miku Hatsune</a></strong></p>

<p>One of the guild members really, really, really, really likes vocaloids. I don&rsquo;t blame her. They&rsquo;re pretty cute and most of the music is actually pretty cute. Miku is actually one of my least favourite vocaloids (out of the five that I know, haha) so I was surprised at the cuteness of this song.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhHNCfA7NI">Mr. Saxobeat by Alexandra Stan</a></strong></p>

<p>What. Is. This. Catchy. Trickery. I actually like this, what&rsquo;s with my constantly changing views of music? It&rsquo;s seriously pretty good. Kinda stupid, like a lot of music out of there, but just so damn catchy. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that she&rsquo;s attractive. This song kinda reminds me of t.a.t.u&rsquo;s music but that&rsquo;s probably only because Alexandra is also European.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYxlEq8pHNc">HetaOni Douga what I don&rsquo;t even know</a></strong></p>

<p>From the same guild member who likes vocaloids. I&hellip; What? This is worthy of the &ldquo;weird part of YouTube&rdquo; title. There&rsquo;s 12 minutes of weird Hetalia shit. I don&rsquo;t really like Hetalia and uh, I just couldn&rsquo;t really watch it for some reason? One of my favourite songs is half an hour long and I couldn&rsquo;t pay attention to this at all.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSIV5r1oyQw">Classical Servant of Evil by some Nico Chorus</a></strong></p>

<p>Why does Mystic do this to me? Seriously, this a really pretty cover of what I assume is a really pretty song. I really like this. Although I mostly only watched through the whole thing to see the story unfold. I feel a bit bad because after around 2 minutes in, I was bored of the song. Around the 4 minute mark, things got better but still, that&rsquo;s a long time to be bored in a song.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p9asau6ia4">CLEVER SLEAZOID (cover) by Miku Hatsune</a></strong></p>

<p>Another rediscovery. I first heard this almost year ago I think (so says my comment from 11 months ago). It&rsquo;s kinda funny how much the J-rock fandom seems to despise vocaloids. They always claim &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not real music!&rdquo; Just look at the J-Music confessions Tumblr. Actually, I was on TH3JROCKFAN&rsquo;s Facebook page a couple of days (weeks?) ago when they announced that there&rsquo;s going to be a visual kei/J-rock vocaloid album. A lot of the comments were pretty negative. :/ I was surprised. There&rsquo;s actually a lot of good vocaloid songs out there. I used this video as an example of a decent vocaloid cover. And a Malice Mizer songs as well. What was it?? Syunikiss? Brise? I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=parJWVvSZXs">Rolling Girl by Miku Hatsune</a></strong></p>

<p>Mystic really likes her vocaloids and I can&rsquo;t resist clicking on every single YouTube link that&rsquo;s presented before me. And I actually really like this song. Somehow I&rsquo;m always really surprised when I like the vocaloid songs Mystic recommends.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0IuNv27sOE">England sings the campfire song</a></strong></p>

<p>Mystic also really likes her Hetalia. I think we&rsquo;ve already establish I don&rsquo;t like Hetalia. I don&rsquo;t like this but it&rsquo;s still a discovery.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oOu-vKx7Qk">The Campfire Song (Spongebob edition)</a></strong></p>

<p>My childhood, enough said.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMXwFo4zJIk">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! from Soul Eater</a></strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t finished watching Soul Eater. *sobs at my endless to watch anime list* But I do like this song quite a lot.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdMpJ9Zm2ts">Sombody to Love by CLUBSODA</a></strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny because the creator of the song actually had the guts to go onto 2NE1 videos, find people who like 2NE1, and message them with this song, hoping they&rsquo;d get views. It actually worked. I like this song a lot. Like. The vocalist, Motsu, is so attractive. In her face and in her little mannerism, and ugh, especially her voice. Her voice. Hnnng. Sounds like Koda Kumi (who is apparently one of Motsu&rsquo;s influences). But yes. So catchy. Dubstep, I thought I hated you. I think vocal-less dubstep angers me. But this isn&rsquo;t vocal-less dubstep and I love this song.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhXkguYoJKI">NightmaRe by sNoW</a></strong></p>

<p>From xthrowxdownx&rsquo;s J-Music podcast. Apparently it&rsquo;s from an anime but I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I really <strike>like</strike> love it when Japanese female musicians sing the way sNoW does. I don&rsquo;t know what it is about her voice but I love it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz3QtQMz6uk">The Way You Look Tonight (cover) by Seth MacFarlane</a></strong></p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to tell someone to shut up? Yeah, that was me while watching this video. I don&rsquo;t really know what compelled me to look up Seth MacFarlane (creator of Family Guy, voices of Peter, Brian, Stewie, Quagmmire, and more, if you didn&rsquo;t know). I think was watching the Pearl episode with my brother (the episode when Brian complains about not finding love and he finally does but lol shit happens) and the music sequence comes on and I was looking it up on YouTube. Then I found out, woah, Seth MacFarlane does all of these voices, he drew them all, he&rsquo;s funny, he has his values intact, he&rsquo;s somewhat attractive, <strong>and</strong> he can sing. So, I looked for videos of him singing and BAM he hits me with Sinatra and frigging Sinatra man, Family Guy suddenly makes sense. He&rsquo;s just such a cool classy cat in this video. Just taking drags on his cigar with the hat and crooning into that mic. Flipping fudge. I want to tell him to shut up because he&rsquo;s too talented. SETH MACFARLANE PLEASE.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhFY9x8ATh0">Ugly (Japanese version cover) by Zessei Bijin!</a></strong></p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a recent, recent discovery. I&rsquo;ve been getting into K-pop recently, more specifically, 2NE1 because those girls are gorgeous. I like looking for Japanese covers of their songs and that&rsquo;s pretty much how I found Zessei Bijin! I listened to all of their 2NE1 covers and I subscribed to them immediately. These girls have really great voices. My only complaint is that their songs usually don&rsquo;t start off that well. It takes around 30 seconds to a minute to actually get into the groove of their songs. Which is unfortunate because not a lot of people are willing to stick around that long.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zTUJBFiVLA">Mister (Japanese cover) by Zessei Bijin!</a></strong></p>

<p>I seriously cannot pass up the chance to talk about this song. I. Frigging. Love. This. Song. It&rsquo;s so cute and sexy and catchy, and damn, the girls from Kara are really pretty. I could listen to this song forever and ever and I would never be tired of it. So peppy and cute and uguu.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAnPerDr758">Shiroi Yuki no Princess Wa (cover) by Zessei Bijin!, Zodiac,and Akatsuki Taiyou</a></strong></p>

<p>A seriously crazy good song. I showed this song to Mystic and she actually liked it. Yay. Mystic seal of approval. :D This came up on my YouTube homepage because lol, I&rsquo;m subscribed to Zessei Bijin! Before I watched this video, I never realized that there were more groups like them out there. And male groups. Males that sing vocaloid songs. M A L E S. I like F E M A L E S too but damn, M A L E S. I cannot deny the fact that I love male voices. Especially male voices singing in Japanese. But not to outshine the lovely females in this song. Moon really shines in this song. Like really. There&rsquo;s this one part in the song where she just sustains this note and it sounds so pretty. And Minnie is her usually cutesy self and it sounds like she&rsquo;s getting better. I think I&rsquo;m going to liveblog this song. Okay? I&rsquo;m liveblogging it.</p>

<p>Okay, this is my first reactions to the video and then some. THIS IS KINDA CRAZY BUT I MENTALLY DO THIS WITH ALL OF THE SONGS I LISTEN TO OKAY?</p>

<p>0:21 &#8211; Oh what is this cuteness. The art used in this is gorgeous.</p>

<p>0:23 &#8211; Ugh, BEIBEI YES COME TO ME. Seriously, she has such a powerful and clear and overall amazing voice.</p>

<p>0:30 &#8211; Wait. It&rsquo;s a guy. A GUY IS SINGING. His voice is so low and deep and wow.</p>

<p>0:34 &#8211; I love the effect in this voice even though it isn&rsquo;t consistent with the others.</p>

<p>0:35 &#8211; What. Antares. Such a cool name. It&rsquo;s one letter off from my last name. What. He has a cool voice too. What. I love how he&rsquo;s building with each word ugh.</p>

<p>0:43 &#8211; K is really cute okay. Omg now there&rsquo;s Minnie too. MINNIE IS SO CUTE. What. This whole part is too cute. I can&rsquo;t&hellip; Voices this cute should not exist, okay?</p>

<p>1:00 &#8211; Oh goodness, Ann from the Ugly cover. Yes.</p>

<p>1:09 &#8211; I&rsquo;ve never heard of these tw-holy crap yes. Wait. Onion? That&rsquo;s seriously so cute. Onion. ASFASFGSDGLDFK.</p>

<p>1:13 &#8211; More people I don&rsquo;t really know, wow there&rsquo;s a lot of them. I never knew.</p>

<p>1:18 &#8211; MOOOOOON. Oh goodness. When her voice just sustains that and just the oh god. I can&rsquo;t even speak properly right now.</p>

<p>1:33 &#8211; Joel who are you and shut up your voie is too heavenly okay.</p>

<p>1:36 &#8211; Ah, the Kazekoe guy again. Oh wow. That release. Wow.</p>

<p>1:40 &#8211; Guys, we&rsquo;re back to cuteness. Oh the cuteness. These two are cute. Aura and K are cute. D;</p>

<p>1:49 &#8211; Minnie. So. Cute.</p>

<p>1:51 &#8211; Ryodo. Who are you and who told you that your voice could be like that, stop.</p>

<p>1:57 &#8211; God who is this Kirby. WHO. HIS VOICE IS DELICIOUS.</p>

<p>2:01 &#8211; RYODO WHY ARE YOU SINGING AGAIN STOP MY OVARIES ARE HURTING.</p>

<p>2:03 &#8211; WHY ARE BOTH YOU STILL STINGING STOOOOOOP.</p>

<p>2:12 &#8211; Ugh, Tonkhai. What a crystal clear voice. So warm it makes me feel all fuzzy and cozy inside.</p>

<p>2:16 &#8211; Omg this Onion. I am crying because he is an Onion and that&rsquo;s what onions do.</p>

<p>2:22 &#8211; SIA. WHAT AN ADORABLE VOICE. IT&rsquo;S ADORABLE.</p>

<p>2:28 &#8211; I really love Antares&rsquo; vibrado what. And Moon is doing that thing again. It&rsquo;s too good. Don&rsquo;t stop Moon.</p>

<p>2:51 &#8211; If I had a drink I would have spitten it out all over my laptop screen. THIS IS THE BEST PART OF THE SONG. NO JOKES. I got goosebumps from this part. The voices sound all beautiful together.</p>

<p>3:11 &#8211; Omg Sia. SoooooOoOoOo cute. A bit breathy, but still cute. KISSUU.</p>

<p>3:21 &#8211; The cuteness continues. Seriously. These girls have to stop being cute I&rsquo;m feeling very self conscious right now.</p>

<p>3:33 &#8211; Beibei and Jun is the best idea. Ever.</p>

<p>3:38 &#8211; Oooh Liana I like her in this part. Still don&rsquo;t know who she is but oooh I like.</p>

<p>3:41 &#8211; Antares what are you doing please stop I&rsquo;m dying here.</p>

<p>3:58 &#8211; I love it when Tonkhai sings like this, I can&rsquo;t even register how awesome her voice is.</p>

<p>4:09 &#8211; Holy balls there are a lot of them.</p>

<p>4:12 &#8211; Antares I thought I told you to stop. I love that low vibrado wtf stop.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hOVecXftog">Sayoko (short English cover) by Antares</a></strong></p>

<p>Uh, I really like this song. I&rsquo;ve already said that Antares really stood out for me in the previous video and wow, his voice is like chocolate. The first time I listened to this, I just sat there and replayed it a thousand times. Not only is Sayoko just an amazing song overall, listening to the English cover sung by a great vocalist is too much. I also swear it&rsquo;s not because of the accent because I don&rsquo;t really like accents in the first place opps, I&rsquo;m a horrible female. Plus, his IA and full length non-acoustic covers of the song is flipping amazing too.</p>

  <img src="http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/521/direngreyjuly2012.png" alt="DIR EN GREY Countdown??" />
</div>

<p>A couple days ago, the Diru fandom on Tumblr was freaking out. I checked the DIR EN GREY tag just to be in the loop. Lo and behold, I see screenshots of this. I immediately went to the <a href="http://direngrey.co.jp/">official website</a> and there it was. The background was slowly fading in and out with different pictures and the timer slowly ticked away.</p>

<p>First, I freaked out. I went on Twitter, saw @DEG_CANADA&rsquo;s tweet about the countdown and key smashed like there was no tomorrow.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit worried and excited.</p>

<p>Worried because what if it&rsquo;s bad news?? I highly doubt it, because Diru just doesn&rsquo;t seem like the band to troll us. If it was all a joke, I have no idea what I&rsquo;d do. In the light of Versailles and their hiatus, I&rsquo;m really hoping it&rsquo;s not bad news. Then again, why would they have a countdown for a potential hiatus/disbandment? No one wants to count that down.</p>

<p>Excited because a multitude of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe Kyo has his voice 100% back and can sing again!</li>
<li>New album?!</li>
<li>Remastered and expanded DUM SPIRO SPERO??</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re going on tour</li>
<li>Some sort of big promotional anniversary thing like re-releasing CDs</li>
<li>DIR EN GREY MOVIE</li>
<li>???</li>
</ul>

<p>I honestly have no idea. I&rsquo;ve talked about Diru being teases before but they really are teases. I can&rsquo;t stand this waiting. Well, you have my attention now, DIR EN GREY. Speak up now!</p>
