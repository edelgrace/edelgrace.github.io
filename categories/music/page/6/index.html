<p><strong>Your favourite Dir en grey era.</strong></p>

<p>Hrmm. I&rsquo;d say the current era and the MOAB and UROBOROS era. This era seems very natural to me and the two previous eras just naturally lead up to it. It was inevitable.</p>

<p>Over a week ago I went to the Stampede grounds to see Showbands Live. Showbands Live is an annual marching band competition. Every year there are the regulars (The Stetsons Calgary Showband, The Red Deer Royals, and Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts). Last year I was part of the Ghosts and I wanted to support them and see them compete. This year there were a lot of American bands that were participating. There are no words to describe how amazing each band was.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of all the acts that preformed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chinook Country Line Dancers</li>
<li>A Band of Outriders</li>
<li>The Red Deer Royals</li>
<li>The Renegade Regiment (US)</li>
<li>Calgary Stampede Showband</li>
<li>Lighthouse Brigade of Recine (US)</li>
<li>Calgary Stetsons Showband</li>
<li>Sound of Sun Prairie (US)</li>
<li>Shadow Armada (US)</li>
<li>Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/8065/76386837.png" alt="Stetsons" style="float:right;width:50%;height:50%;padding:5px;" /></p>

<p>All the bands were great but a few of them really stuck out to me. First things first, The Stetsons. The Stetsons is our rival band. For some reason, we don&rsquo;t like each other and it&rsquo;s been that way for a long time. Their show was pretty&hellip; decent. However, it bore a ton of similarities to Grandin&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s show. It was pretty obvious that they took some inspiration from our show, even copying some charts and formations. Even the concept of the show was the same. Other than that, it was a decent show. I think it relied to heavily on props but the music was pretty good.</p>

<p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s The Shadow Armada. They were from the US, a high school marching band. I must say that they were extremely impressive. Their show was extremely precise, the music was amazing, and the visuals just wow. I really loved their drumline. I have a soft spot for good drumlines even though I play a woodwind instrument. The drum solos were intricate and just so darn catchy. The Shadow Armada was a great marching band and really a great treat to watch. So great that they won first place. They really deserved as they were just that amazing.</p>

<p><img src="http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3755/71936535.png" alt="Grandin Ghosts" style="float:left;width:50%;height:50%;padding:5px;" /></p>

<p>Of course, I have to mention my own band, the Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts. After listening to them play their show music every day of the week before school, I have to say that they really improved from the beginning of the year. Their music was just amazing and so epic, and loud, and in your face. The show wasn&rsquo;t up to par with the early morning practices unfortunately. Still, their show was pretty good. Better than the Stetsons of course. Their theme was &ldquo;Pandora&rsquo;s Box&rdquo;. It was pretty cool because they had an actual box. It was glowing and spouting fog and everything. I have to say it was cool to see a prop like that. Sadly, they only landed third place but their competitors were tough. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m so proud of them!</p>

<p>Speaking of Grandin, I finished summer school two days ago. I finished the course with a 95% and a 98% on my final exam. Wow, I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s over. Now I can sleep in, stay up late, and blog as much as I want, haha.</p>

          <p><p>Like the title says, happy Canada day! Today Prince William and Kate are in Canada as we speak celebrating with us. My family doesn&rsquo;t really do anything special for Canada day except for wearing red all day. Last year I spent Canada day in the States actually because of marching band. We were practicing on a football field and on the large scaffolding where the band directors stood, we hung a huge Canadian flag on it. Yeah, that was our Canada day celebration. Today, my family friend is holding a birthday party. That&rsquo;s the extent of our partying for this year.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention this last time I blogged but my favourite contestant on <em>Filipinas Got Talent</em> won! His name is Marcelito Po Moy and he&rsquo;s amazing. He can sing like a man and a woman. The first time I listened to him, I thought he was actually a girl even though he doesn&rsquo;t look like it. I really like it when he sings in his normal voice though.</p>

<p><img src="http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/1804/happyfeetplacedsecondin.jpg" alt="Happy Feet" style="float:right;" /></p>

<p>However, the contestants that got second place really did capture my heart as well. They&rsquo;re a two man act called Happy Feet. It consists of two brothers, one 12 (Laudito) and the other 21 (Ramonito), and they did tap dancing. At first they were voted out but they were voted back in again with an overwhelming amount of votes. Then they landed in second place with 18.22% votes (Marcelito had 19.36%).</p>

<p>I think their story really resonated with the viewers. You see, the Philippines is a third world country and most people have it hard. I don&rsquo;t know the full story of Happy Feet but they have it hard too. They come from a poor family. The two brothers had to sell tomatoes and eat only bread everyday to finance their trip to the auditions. During the auditions, the brothers revealed that they weren&rsquo;t wearing real tap dancing shoes since they couldn&rsquo;t afford it, but rather leather shoes they made. Actually, they had no idea that the dance they loved so much was called tap dancing before the show. They always referred it to &ldquo;happy feet dancing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At the end of their journey, when the grand winners were finally announced, one of the judges exclaimed that she would buy a loaf of bread for every member of their family (she&rsquo;s also been reported to have bought the boys tap dancing shoes right after their audition). Although Happy Feet&rsquo;s talent wasn&rsquo;t as explosive and awe inspiring as Marcelito&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no doubt that they are shining example of genuine family love and perseverance.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Last night, I had my very first concert experience. That&rsquo;s right, I saw My Chemical Romance. It was amazingly awesome. For some reason though, I expected it to be much more&hellip; Epic. A lot of people here on Mibba describe their first concert like it was the best orgasm of life.</p>

<p>But for me, it was kinda awkward and surreal. I can&rsquo;t believe that the band was really in front of me. It just felt like I was watching a video or something. It didn&rsquo;t seem real. The people around me were pushing and shoving and throwing their fists in the air and screaming. That part was so real. But the band was like a hallucination or like a dream. Ahh, I can&rsquo;t even remember what any of the members looked like. TT_TT</p>

<p>The music was awesome though. I was so pleasantly surprised at all the older songs they played. They played <em>This is How I Disappear</em> as one of the first songs, and then I knew my life was complete. I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the new album, and I knew all the songs they played from that album except for one or two so I was thankful for that. I got lucky, haha. I didn&rsquo;t listen to <em>Danger Days</em> as much. <em>Destroya</em>, <em>Planetary (GO!)</em>, and <em>Thank You for the Venom</em> was AMAZING live. The energy was so high.</p>

<p>Also, I feel like a need to grow already. I&rsquo;m 4&rsquo;11&rdquo;. I was swarmed by tall people. There was the odd moments when I could see over some shoulders but then another head would get in the way. Ah well, there&rsquo;s other people taller than me who couldn&rsquo;t see. The music mostly got me pumping. I just wish I was taller.</p>

<p>I still can&rsquo;t get rid of the surreal feeling though. It didn&rsquo;t seem real. Maybe it&rsquo;s supposed to be like that?</p>

<p><strong>Q U E S T I O N S</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Describe your first concert experience. If you haven&rsquo;t been to a concert yet, what would you like it to be like?</li>
<li>MCR. Yay or nay?</li>
<li>Danger Days. Yee or naw?</li>
<li>How do you feel about orange peelings?</li>
</ol>

          <p><p><strong>Listening to:</strong> Tada, Hitotsu no Koi &#8211; Koizora OST</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve been obssessed with <em>Koizora</em> lately. The movie, drama, manga, novel, AND the soundtrack. Oh jeez. No matter what form of media it&rsquo;s in, it never ceases to make bawl my eyes out. Plus, in the drama, Seto Koji is pretty hot. *cough*</p>

<p>Today was pretty good. I went to the mall and caused some shenanigans. I bought a visa gift card and I&rsquo;m going to use it to buy iPod toch apps. Square Enix games FTW.</p>

<p>So, something even more amazing, is <em>Joanna Newsom</em>. I love her now. No joke. She&rsquo;s like Björk but not as amazing. Never did I ever think I would like folk music. Her voice is so child like and her harp playing is mesmerizing. The poetry in the lyrics is a breath of fresh air. Nothing like mainstream pop. Mmm. :3</p>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s 1:06 AM and I feel like passing out, I&rsquo;m going to sleep. Goodnight interwebz!</p>
