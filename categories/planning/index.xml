I came to school on a reading day because I have a group project to work on. The meeting doesn’t start for another hour so I’m just going over my AI notes because I need to catch up on the material.</description>

Team messy notes 2015. My mind was blown away during this lecture. Honestly, some of the algorithm solutions for simple problems like finding the two closest points in a plane, are extremely interesting.</description>

It’s early morning and I’m trying to do some of my assignment that I should have started over the weekend but I was working on a group project instead. I really should learn to manage my time better.</description>

I came to school three hours early today (I start at 10) so I can get a head start on the exercises we’re doing today in tutorial. It’s just so awkward when the TA asks for the answer and no one speaks up.</description>

Finished making presentation index cards. I’m really bad when it comes to public speaking so I need to prep a lot. Most group presentations I‘ve had involved “just winging it” and that never goes well for me.</description>

I’m feeling super down for some reason right now and I can’t really pinpoint what it is. It feels like there’s a dark cloud looming over my head. I tried to make my notes look extra neat, neater than usual, as that usually helps me calm down whenever I do feel like this.</description>

My super messy notes (right) vs the rewritten version (left). During a lecture, neat and legible notes are the last things on my mind. Okay, sometimes I zone out and look down at my paper and think, “Wow, this looks horrible.</description>

Some pictures of my diy planner, taken with a potato. I borrowed inspiration from diyfish inserts. Whenever I open it up, I can see my whole month and reoccurring tasks right in front of me.</description>

In bed with Camus. A penpal recommended this book to me and he expects a nice, long essay about it. Okay, I think (and hope) that was a joke but I really want to be able to understand this so we can have a meaningful conversation about it.</description>

I’m taking a “zero day” from studying but that doesn’t mean you have to stop learning! I decided to work on my blog and switch frameworks from Bootstrap to Foundation, mostly because Boostrap has the potential to get really bloated and I find that Foundation is more intuitive and their documentation is great.</description>

Here’s a picture of all the school supplies I bought for this year (and hopefully years to come). I didn’t spend a lot compared to previous years and I’m so happy.</description>

I’m in the middle of trying out studyign{.tumblelog}’s method of taking textbook notes for my algorithm design class.
This was seriously a hard section to wrap my head around. Each step of computing a convolution makes sense but the big picture escapes me right now, especially since it involves complex numbers, which I haven’t touched those in years.</description>

Lunch break with cantaloupes and warm pandesal with cheese. I usually don’t like eating at my desk when it comes to breads, especially crumbly breads like pandesal but I was totally craving it.</description>

I forgot where I heard this tip but it’s good to read papers that are in your field in your spare time. I spent like an hour looking for PDFs that I didn’t have to pay to read when I remembered that my university library provides free access to databases and databases of papers.</description>

My Staedtler Triplus Fineliners always ran out quickly so I stopped using them. Seeing how popular Staedtler is, I gave them another chance and they look awesome. Except I’m still worried they might run out fast on me again.</description>

      <description>1/? Favourite pages from my notebooks
On the left is a list of options courses I can pick from for my concentration and my schedule for the next two semesters. On the right is all of the course requirements for my degree and the courses I’m taking to fulfil them. I can’t believe I’m already halfway through my degree! Also, I love writing in monochrome. Boring, I know.</description>

      <description>2015.08.12 &amp;#8211; Working on my DIY planner while watching my brother playing GTAV in the living room. This time, I’m not using my Filofax because I can’t dedicate that much time to cutting up that much paper. As always, my pages are heavily inspired by DIYfish’s Life Mapping System inserts. I just love being able to see my monthly view and (half of) my weekly view at the same time.</description>
