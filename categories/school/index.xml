      <description>Last month, I finally graduated from university. It took me six years to finish university: one year of engineering, four years of computer science, and one year of internship. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent nearly a quarter of my life as an undergraduate.
I remember starting out my first year so optimistic. Engineering classes were so brutal and every week I resolved to start anew. But I really hated those classes except for the software and electrical course.</description>

      <description>I went back to school today. It&amp;rsquo;s a little weird to be back at school but also familiar. This semester is going to be a light one. I&amp;rsquo;m only taking two courses. One course is only five days long. So essentially I just have one course throughout the semester!
The block week course I&amp;rsquo;m taking right now is just a history course but it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting. I&amp;rsquo;ve always found history fascinating but I was never great at being tested on or writing about history.</description>
