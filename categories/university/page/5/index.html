          <p><p><strong>Warning: Implied misogynistic content, alluding to the USBC shootings, and mentions of rape.</strong></p>

<p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I&rsquo;ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was listening to an episode of the Internet Box, which was recorded around the time when Andrew got a Tumblr and started stirring the pot with the social justice fan community. Dylon was trying to steer away the conversation from using ableism terms and Barbara told Dylon that he has &ldquo;So much to learn about the world.&rdquo; That made me legitimately angry and sad because I really love Barbara but no, Barbara there a couple of things you have a lot to learn too. I wish I could be that blissfully and purposefully ignorant of all the things that my friends and I do that are harmful. In the famous words of Burnie Burns, &ldquo;God dammit Barbara.&rdquo;</li>
<li>My prof asked who was going to watch Maleficent and then he asked if anyone was going to see it because of Angelina Jolie and I think I was the only one who put up their hand??? In a history of video games class filled with mostly males I am confused but also slightly pleased.</li>

<li><p>&ldquo;College is a time when everyone experiences things such as sex, and fun, and pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Idk, I hate how there are people who think this a guaranteed and mandatory and expected &ldquo;college experience.&rdquo; I mean I know &ldquo;fun&rdquo; is objective but I’m pretty sure in this context it means &ldquo;partying&rdquo; and &ldquo;clubbing&rdquo; but college isn’t just that, there are other ways of having fun too.</p>

<p>And god, this guy is just so… So full of it. This video makes me sick to my stomach. We don’t owe people our affections and we don’t &ldquo;deny&rdquo; anyone to a happy life. Wow I’m having a hard time of sympathizing with this guy (which I&rsquo;m not trying to do but he&rsquo;s trying to get us to do). He takes the friendzone to the extreme I can’t wrap my head around how there are people who actually think this way. It just sickens me that people died over this. this is not ok.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay this one is too long to put under a bullet point.</p>

<p>I honestly love Nintendo because they’ve been doing their own thing ever since they got into the video industry. Before no one really cared about bugs in their games but then Nintendo came along and demanded all of their programmers to go through rigorous testing. They controlled what games could or could not be released on their platform (preventing things like <em>Custer&rsquo;s Revenge</em> which was basically a rape simulator for the Atari 2600 made by a porn company). Because of this (and their good games of course) they single-handedly revived the video game industry in the 70s/80s (my prof would be disappointed reading this).</p>

<p>It kinda makes me sad to see them going on a downhill but they are honestly stuck in the old times and very much set in their traditional values and people thought it was unthinkable then, but it’s even more unthinkable now. Although you gotta hand it to them for sticking to their guns. Now I totally get why nintendo does the backward things they do.</p>

<p>And yeah this rant came about because I was totally listening to The Patch. Every week they talk about something that I’m learning in class. Last week they were talking about arcade games and this week they’re talking about Nintendo. I love hearing current &ldquo;news&rdquo; about the things I’m learning it makes things that much more interesting.</p>

<p>TL;DR I&rsquo;m not so surprised about nintendo’s “backwardness” anymore when that’s what they’ve been for the entirety of their existence and once (maybe more than once idk yet??) it actually worked out for them.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Mass Effect 4 I just want to talk more. I want to learn more about their cultures and I want to do stuff for them, even if it’s just talking them through decisions and not going to the ends of the universe for them. Like how that one “couple” on the citadel were debating whether or not they wanted to undergo gene therapy for the unborn child. I also want to eavesdrop on conversations. I want to hear mundane stuff like &ldquo;Did you hear about X in accounting? he’s getting MARRIED.&rdquo; I want to hear game relevant stuff like &ldquo;I heard that if you go to this planet, you can get Y model of armor&rdquo; or &ldquo;There’s a rumour that Z is hiding in the W solar system.&rdquo; There are a lot of other things i want in ME4 but like adsjkfhkasdj. I hope ME4 will be amazing, Bioware please don’t let me doooooown.</li>
<li>Did I ever mention that I was watching one of Ray’s livestreams and I said something in the chat and Ray mentioned my name AND HE SAID IT RIGHT and it just made me so happy to hear my name in his voice like I can almost die happy now I just need a hug from him.</li>
<li>I took an ethics course and our prof was so hard on us when it came to the topic of eating meat. Every single argument we could come up with FOR eating meat, he tore them apart and exposed every single flaw in them. Then he gave his arguments AGAINST eating meat and they were so convincing and almost untouchable. I just CANNOT justify eating meat anymore but I still do it anyway. I just feel extremely guilty whenever I eat meat now.</li>
<li>when I was in elementary school I tried to make an Alyson Stoner guild on Neopets except I couldn’t say &ldquo;Alyson Stoner&rdquo; in the description because it kept censoring me telling me I couldn’t use that word and at that point I was innocent enough to not know why her name was a bad word.</li>
<li>Sometimes I wish there were &ldquo;readme for newbies&rdquo; version for 99% of the readme files on github because I’m really not that great at reading documentation and most of them assume that I already know something but I don’t and I never know what it is that I should know because I don’t know it in the first place???</li>

          <p><p>Ugh I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll try to make this as painless as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had a dream where I literally just lived out my entire day, down to sitting in lecture being bored and taking notes.</p>

<p>You don’t even know how disappointed I am when I woke up knowing that I had to do it all over again.</p></li>

<li><p>I’m using emacs via SSH for my CS assignment and the backspace key doesn’t mean backspace, the del key means backspace AND I KEEP HITTING BACKSPACE. I’m so frustrated. I don’t want to change the settings either because what if I do something I shouldn’t do because I’m on my university&rsquo;s servers.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes I like to think that my faith in humanity is so strong that I can leave my stuff anywhere at the university without asking anyone to watch it but I just really don’t want to talk to people.</p></li>

<li><p>so I just listened to DIR EN GREY’s new single. Sustain the Untruth. Hmm. I think it will grow on me. I like the intro and outro (dat bass), the synth, and all that typical Kyo vocals (he sounds so sinister, wow, I&rsquo;m not surprised though). The chorus sounds a bit out of place to me. Overall it’s okay but I think it’s kinda anticlimatic.</p>

<p>BUT OMG. RUTEN NO TOU ACOUSTIC VERSION. That’s some godly music right there. But back to STU. the music video is also kinda lack lustre. How did the deg shoutbox put it? Kyo is like a zombie mary magdalene I don’t understand.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday I was mailing stuff (now three months ago) and there’s this guy at the mall who works at the knives store and he has a sweet mohawk. I was sitting nearby putting stamps on envelopes and an old lady asked him if she could touch his hair. it was kinda cute but at the same time I wonder if he was annoyed but he sounded really cheerful so I guess not?</p></li>

<li><p>The best thing about Lindsay having a tumblr though is when she reblogs posts about Michael or about her and Michael and kinda fangirls over it. She’s like living the ultimate fangirl dream like, &ldquo;You see the person in this post? I’m getting married to this guy.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>I feel so happy for recognizing Rie Fu’s voice but it’s only because she sang in really fluent English. Hourou Musuko is the sweetest anime I have ever watched. Yeah, it’s a slice of life school anime but I really love how it treated the LGBTQ issues. It all seems so perfect though. If only more people facing those issues received the support the characters did. And if only people reacted the way the characters did. Wow, so sweet.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-809" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-809">1</a></sup></p></li>

          <p><p>The Monday after reading week is always the worst, that is. I told my friend who is from the States that I had reading week and she had no idea what it is. It&rsquo;s pretty much a Canadian/Commonwealth countries thing where we get a couple days off in the middle of the semester. I heard from the grapevine that reading week started because mid-semester is a period when too stressed out students tend to commit suicide.</p>

<p>To be honest, reading week makes me more stressed out! Mostly because I always plan to be productive and study but then I end up doing nothing at all and it makes me stressed that I did absolutely zilch. It definitely doesn&rsquo;t help that all of my midterms are the week after reading week. Ay&hellip;</p>

<p>So what exactly did I do all week, if not studying?</p>

<p>Mostly <a href="http://mazohystic.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and the Olympics. I&rsquo;m usually not a big sports fan but this year I found myself really invested! Mostly because of the super cute<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-593" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-593">1</a></sup> and super adorable<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-593" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-593">2</a></sup> and super talented<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-593" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-593">3</a></sup> Japanese figure skater and gold medalist, Yuzuru Hanyu. Ever since I disovered this skating genius, I became engrossed in the figure skating world. I watched the FP (free skate program, also called LP/long program) and watched him win gold!</p>

<p>Favourite men skaters at Sochi (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yuzuru Hanyu</strong><br />
Do I even have to explain again?</li>
<li><strong>Patrick Chan</strong><br />
Ah, my fellow Canadian. It was awesome he got silver for Canada. He&rsquo;s a great guy and super cute as well. He&rsquo;s so strong, masculine, and &ldquo;stereotypically&rdquo; athletic. A strong contrast to Hanyu, who&rsquo;s really feminine, soft, and almost whimsical. I really appreciate that about Chan. Oh, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSPbjVsv1ug">his exhibition</a> was pretty great, too. It was weird trying to see him &ldquo;let down his hair.&rdquo; It was almost awkward but he had enough charms to pull it off. He was smoooooth. There&rsquo;s no one else I&rsquo;d rather have for silver!</li>
<li><strong>Denis Ten</strong><br />
The bronze medalist. This guy really captured my heart. He&rsquo;s a skater from Kazakhstan and he&rsquo;s GREAT on the ice. Technically strong and had so much artistic quality. I also came across really cute gifs of him on Tumblr. He&rsquo;s such a cute dork! His exhibition was super cool. It featured Kazakh folk music and was really intense. My jaw was open pretty much the whole time. wOW. Plus he favourited one of my Tweets on Twitter. I&rsquo;m still freaking out about it.</li>
<li><strong>Kevin Reynolds</strong><br />
Ok, this guy is super awesome. In his SP (short program), he skated to ACDC. Who skates to ACDC in figure skating?? This guy. He&rsquo;s such a rockstar. He fell a couple of times, which visibly affected him. It was disheartening to watch him react to his low score. However, in his FP, he definitely redeemed himself. He looked like a Greek god, and skated like one too, if Greek gods could skate. It made me really happy! Oh, and he&rsquo;s CANADIAN. So. Proud. To. Be. Canadian.</li>
<li><strong>Jason Brown</strong><br />
Technically, Jason Brown was my gateway to figure skating but Hanyu just gave me that final push. I saw a video of Jason Brown <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzlcVKFVWVI">doing an Irish dance</a> in one of his skates on Tumblr, and I was just in awe. He has so much personality and poise. He doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;the jump&rdquo; (the ever elusive quad) that others do but there&rsquo;s something about him that just draws you in to his performances.</li>
<li><strong>Daisuke Takahashi</strong><br />
I missed out on his SP but I did watch his FP. Even so, I only need that to know he&rsquo;s legendary. It&rsquo;s a shame that he&rsquo;s retiring because, ugh, the talent he has! His exhibition was fabulous. There was absolutely no denying his talent.</li>
<li><strong>Tatsuki Machida</strong><br />
I will admit, I only watched his exhibtion. But it was one of my favourite skates from Sochi purely because it was pretty amazing. He skated along to Queen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop Me Now&rdquo; and it was awesome and lighthearted. Not to mention, there was a sweet air guitar bit in it too.</li>
<li><strong>Javier Fernandez</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m so sorry, Javi, but I only watched your exhibition as well&hellip; And to be honest&hellip; It was super hilarious. It featured a medley of songs with bits where he recorded himself in an imaginary role of a gym trainer. It was full of personality and just made me giggle and smile throughout the whole thing. I mean, come on, how can you not love a hot Spanish skater skating to himself saying things like &ldquo;A body like this just doesn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo;?</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t restrict myself to just male skaters, contrary to popular belief. I watched the ladies in it&rsquo;s entiriety. It was an emotional rollercoaster.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Isadora Williams</strong><br />
She wasn&rsquo;t one of the strongest contenders for the medal, but I just loved loved loved her FP. It was super smooth and seductive!</li>
<li><strong>Akiko Suzuki</strong><br />
This girl is a trooper. She suffered from anorexia and successfully overcame it! I really think Suzuki is one of the prettiest ladies that was present at Sochi. She&rsquo;s seriously so adorable. I love her smile, I&rsquo;m always smiling along with her. It hurts after a while because it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s always smiling! Her dress in the FP was breathtakingly beautiful. I really loved it, she skated so sweetly. She was just like a ballerina! It&rsquo;s a shame that she&rsquo;s retiring as well. Then again, she was the oldest female skater there. 28 years old doesn&rsquo;t sound much but that&rsquo;s old in figure skating. Man, I totally thought she was way younger! I love her youthfulness!</li>
<li><strong>Polina Edmunds</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m not sure if Edmunds is really thin or really lanky or a combination of both. Her limbs are really long and she uses it to her advantage. She&rsquo;s super graceful on the ice! I loved how the commentators talked about her. They made her sounds a bit cocky but in a playful non-insulting way. She just has a lot of confidence! I love seeing that in her! And I don&rsquo;t blame her for her confidence. She was stunning on the ice.</li>
<li><strong>Mao Asada</strong><br />
Please don&rsquo;t talk to me about Mao Asada. I&rsquo;m absolutely smitten by this lady, almost as smitten I am by Yuzuru! I&rsquo;ve heard she is a skating legend in Japan. Plus, she&rsquo;s had a rivalry with fellow female figure skater &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; Yuna Kim, which means she is WAY up there. I watched the SP with great anticipation for Asada&rsquo;s skate. It wasn&rsquo;t at all what I expected. She fell on her first jump, a triple axle if I recall correctly. That was okay but she let it affect her performance and missed other jumps as well. It was really just super sad, you could see her get super frustrated. Everyone thought she&rsquo;d be on the podium but she just lost her chance. However, the next day, she <strong>slayed</strong> the competition, earning the third highest mark for that day and the fourth highest mark of all time. She definitely redeemed herself. The skate was beautiful (as was she), technically great (she landed eight hard jumps), and just so emotional (I was getting so teary eyes because I couldn&rsquo;t stop think, &ldquo;Mao you deserve a medal!&rdquo; and then she started crying as well). Definitely my number one favourite of the entire 2014 Winter Olympics. Emotionally charged and beautiful!</li>
<li><strong>Carolina Kostner</strong><br />
There was something beautiful about her performances. She skated cleanly, had the &ldquo;star power&rdquo; to captivate you, and was all around breath taking. I really enjoyed them and she earned her bronze medal! Her costumes were pretty awesome too, wow.</li>
<li><strong>Yulia Lipnitskaya</strong><br />
This kid is only 15 years old and she is AMAZING. She&rsquo;s so extremely graceful on the ice. It&rsquo;s just beautiful to watch her skate. I was mesmerized the first time I saw her skate! She&rsquo;s definitely Russia&rsquo;s figure skating sweetheart for sure.</li>
<li><strong>Yuna Kim</strong>She&rsquo;s the queen of figure skating. I prefer Asada but Kim is definitely Asada&rsquo;s equal, if not, she&rsquo;s better than Asada. She is pretty much technical perfection.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I definitely wrote this a week ago and I&rsquo;m already done with all of my midterms.</p>

<p>Computer Science: B+</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not happy with this, haha. I was 0.5 away from getting an A-! I&rsquo;m so disappointed, haha. Then again, I literally studied for this midterm for maybe a total of three hours, and even that is generous. I guess it&rsquo;s a good enough mark for barely studying. I should have studied. Then I would have my A-/A!</p>

<p>Religious Studies: A+</p>

<p>Oh goodness me, I am so happy for this! I totally did not expect this mark. I got a 99%. Technically, he curved it and I got lower but after the curve, I have 99%. I&rsquo;m pretty darn happy about this.</p>

<p>Philosophy: ??</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know yet. I&rsquo;m sure that I did not do as well as my first Philosophy midterm. I was shaky on some of the short answers and I don&rsquo;t think I did the essay to the best of my ability. I&rsquo;m hoping for a B/B+!</p>
