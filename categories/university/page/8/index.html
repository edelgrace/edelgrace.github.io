          <p><p>Moments like these, I question my desire to go to graduate school. I have a paper to write by Friday. I was told to basically start over and I&rsquo;m stuck. It&rsquo;s on a novel and we&rsquo;re supposed to pull out symbols for it and I&rsquo;m just drawing a blank. My prof started connecting some of them and I tried to follow suit but they&rsquo;re too far fetched. I&rsquo;m really frustrated and I don&rsquo;t know what to do! The thought of this paper is really freaking me out because I want to do good but I&rsquo;m not sure if I can. This is one thing I don&rsquo;t miss about high school: essays. I know computer science doesn&rsquo;t lack essays by any means but that&rsquo;s not the focus. Ugh, I just cannot write for the life of me!</p>

<p>When I was younger, I even wanted to be an author. I wanted to write and illustrate my own books. However, I could never finish anything I started. Also, I quickly began to realize that I do not have the talent to be an author. A lot of people say that writing a skill but a <em>great</em> author has talent that can never replace skill. You just can&rsquo;t learn how to bend and twist words into a sentence that takes people&rsquo;s breath away. You can try to copy but it just won&rsquo;t create the same effect. Some people just know how language works.</p>

<p>Another thing that great author&rsquo;s have is knowledge. They understand humanity and know how to tap into our very essence. They see the inner workings of our heart down to the very last blood vessel. Not only do they know the individual well, they also know society. They can critique it and suggest clever ways to remedy even the smallest of society&rsquo;s flaws. Don&rsquo;t even get me started about how well great authors do relationships. They know. They know everything about it.</p>

<p>I wish I was one of those people. I&rsquo;ve met people (okay, one person) who match my description perfectly. I&rsquo;ve given up on writing a long time ago but I didn&rsquo;t really start in the first place. This person has such a beautiful way with words that my jealousy is minuscule in comparison of the awe I feel when I&rsquo;m in this person&rsquo;s presence. It&rsquo;s like knowing that you are standing at the foot of a genius. Is this what people thought when they were in the presence of both Mayakovsky and Bulgakov at the same time?</p>

<p>Back to my original point, I really do think that someone either has it, or they don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re either born with it or were instilled with it at a very young age. Unfortunately, neither happened to me. At my age, it&rsquo;s too late to understand how to create masterpieces. A small part of me is hopeful, though. I wish writing was a skill that I could hone and one day, I&rsquo;ll know everything that makes a human, human.</p>

<p>On another note, I keep forgetting to do these blog posts until the very last minute. As I&rsquo;m writing this, it&rsquo;s nearly 11:30. I started writing at around 10:50. I think I mentioned this yesterday but it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to think of new content to write about. Most of the things I want to write include pictures. Pictures are too time consuming and don&rsquo;t fit into my schedule right now. I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;m hitting my 500 daily word count goal because the app does not keep track of it. It would be cool if the WordPress app did more with it. I&rsquo;d like to see a focus on the admin. I love the posting features but I&rsquo;d like to see more editing themes, adding plugins, changing settings, etc.</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>I am almost done my first month of my second year at university! It&rsquo;s been an interesting year leading up to now. I got into university, turned 18, hated engineering with a passion, sucked at engineering with a passion, went to the Philippines, switched majors (in a transition major right now until I can switch into computer science please don&rsquo;t ask me what it is), got a job as a cashier at Walmart over the summer (don&rsquo;t ask me about that either please), got my courses for this semester dropped, went to fix my schedule, found out it wasn&rsquo;t actually fixed and didn&rsquo;t find out until a few days into the first week, and went to go fix it yet again. So yeah, a quick summary of the last year.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m trying my best to keep ahead in my classes. I&rsquo;m only taking three right now; which is just barely enough to be called a full time student. For this semester I am taking an introductory course to Python, a Russian literature course, and a repeat of a math course that I passed but need a higher grade in to fulfill future prerequisites. My class schedule is pretty light so that&rsquo;s a big relief.</p>

<p><a href="/im-bad-for-the-environment-">Last post</a> I said that I&rsquo;m trying to go mostly paperless. It&rsquo;s going well so far. It sucks that my computer science course requires a computer (which is crazy, I know) and that my math course has online assignments, but hopefully that won&rsquo;t be a problem. I decided against buying a pretty (and pretty expensive) <a href="http://filofaxusa.com">Filofax</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using my page per day (PPD, as I&rsquo;ll refer to it as in the future) planner and I found that I have a lot to do each day. Unless I want to lug around a huge binder planner with me, there&rsquo;s no way I can fit all of it into a smaller sized Filofax. My At-A-Glance DayMinder is working well so far, and I love it. Plus, I can&rsquo;t get over the fact that it&rsquo;s such a lovely shade of orange.</p>

<div class="aligncenter">
  <div class="picture">
    <img src="http://e.bubblepopstar.net/blog/images/planner.png" alt="my planner" /><br />My "busiest" day to date.
  </div>
</div>

<p>I really love colour coding in my planner. Each course is a different colour not only in my planner but in my notes. I bought some <a href="http://zebrapen.com/products/pen/sarasa-se?c=28">Sarasa SE pens</a> at my campus bookstore. I really like the ink quality and how it looks on the page. I also love how it writes. It&rsquo;s not scratchy but oh so smooth. However, it&rsquo;s only been a month and the ink is running out fast! It could be because it&rsquo;s a gel pen and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s pretty much draining onto the page.They&rsquo;re expensive pens too, so I was hoping I would be using them for longer. Maybe I just write too much! Mental note to find nice coloured pens that don&rsquo;t run out so fast. Fat chance of that, but a girl can dream, right?</p>

<div class="aligncenter">
  <div class="picture">
    <img src="http://e.bubblepopstar.net/blog/images/pens.png" alt="pens" /><br />Not sure if you can see the ink levels but compare the green to the purple. This was taken after the first week of school.
  </div>
</div>

<p>While I was going through my endless RSS feed of subscribed blogs (I haven&rsquo;t been keeping up lately, and have a ton of backlog oops), I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.paperlovestory.com/2013/08/preparing-for-university-creating.html">a post from Paper Lovestory</a> showing off Angela&rsquo;s weekly timetable. That post was made exactly a month ago so you can tell where I am in my blog backlog, haha. Angela has a whole lot of cool orangization ideas. I always drool over her expensive accessories (like her Filofaxes). It kinda makes me jealous but at the same time I feel good about the money I save, haha. Plus, the printables she makes can be easily adapted for non-Filofax use, which is great for me! Anyway, the timetable is so simple but it&rsquo;s so good. I took the initiative to do my own. Somewhat colour coded, of course.</p>

<div class="aligncenter">
  <div class="picture">
    <img src="http://e.bubblepopstar.net/blog/images/weekly-schedule.png" alt="pens" /><br />I really want to redo this because I totally think I screwed something up.

<p>These days, most people are going paperless. With things like &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; and thousands of web and mobile apps that can do almost anything you want, it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard. However, I&rsquo;m going the opposite way. I&rsquo;m going back to paper.</p>

<h3 id="why-on-earth-would-i-possibly-want-to-do-this">Why on earth would I possibly want to do this?</h3>

<p>Easy. Smartphones, while useful, also carry a lot of temptations. Sure, you can have 10 note-taking, productivity, schedule apps but you also have an Internet browser, a music player, and quite possibly, a nice library of games. For me, that is a huge con that outweighs any pros. I admit that I lack discipline, especially when it comes to technology. Adding to that, I&rsquo;m also a huge procrastinator. While I don&rsquo;t game a lot on my phone, it still has the Internet. Once I&rsquo;m on the Internet, I don&rsquo;t resurface for hours. All of those apps I just downloaded to help me? They&rsquo;re forgotten as soon as I click on Chrome.</p>

<h3 id="how-exactly-am-i-going-to-go-back-to-paper">How exactly am I going to go back to paper?</h3>

<p>I love stationary. I&rsquo;ve always been obsessed with stationary. When I was younger, I&rsquo;d always be designing and fantasizing about my dream notebooks. One was like an accordion, each side had a pad for different things. For example, addresses, diary, calendar, sketching, etc. My dreams are somewhat coming true, with the lovely invention called the binder. Now, I&rsquo;ve been debating on whether not to buy a <a href="http://www.avery.ca/avery/en_ca/Products/Binders/Durable-Binders/Durable-Viewa-Mini-Binder-for-5_.5in-x-8_.5in-Pages_17116.htm">mini binder</a> and make a DIY planner or to buy a ready made <a href="http://filofaxusa.com">Filofax</a> with some DIY elements. The former is definitely way more cheaper, but a Filofax can also double as a wallet and I&rsquo;m always up for multi-purpose things (except for smartphones). Plus, Filofaxes are soooo pretty. I&rsquo;ve been drooling over them for quite a while now. Except they&rsquo;re so expensive. Ah!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have a day per page DayMinder that works just fine. It has a lot of space to write on, which is great. At the same time though, it&rsquo;s still summer and I don&rsquo;t have that much to write down. It&rsquo;s still pretty great. I&rsquo;m trying to get into the habit of planning my day out now before school starts. Also, I&rsquo;m practicing my writing because I haven&rsquo;t hand written anything in three months. Ouch! I think it&rsquo;s working. Hopefully it will benefit me in the long run.</p>

<p>I quit Tumblr for Lent. It&rsquo;s only been a couple of days, and I&rsquo;ve accumulated so many Tumblr blog posts in my mind and it&rsquo;s kinda driving me crazy. So crazy to the point where a Tumblr and serious blog crossover is inevitable. Tumblr posts are mostly Twitter-like in nature, except ten times the sarcasm, ten times the ironic usage of poor grammar and spelling, and ten times that length. Not to mention the heavily fangirling where everyone assumes that everyone else knows what they&rsquo;re talking about, even if they&rsquo;re not in the fandom (I tried so hard to make this sentence make sense but this is all I got).</p>

<h4 id="ugh-no-wow-stop">Ugh no wow stop</h4>

<p>Attractive engineering guy is really attractive. I haven&rsquo;t seen him since like semester. Now I go to a different lecture for my statics course because my statics prof confuses me. I found out that attractive engineering guy was in the lecture and we&rsquo;ve been sitting together lately. It&rsquo;s nice. I love watching his mouth when he talks. One side of his mouth goes crooked. Really cute. Although he tends to mumble/speak really softly. Combined with the accent I&rsquo;m constantly saying &ldquo;Pardon? Oh goodness, sorry, I didn&rsquo;t hear that&hellip; What? Say that again? &hellip; Pardon?&rdquo; I also noticed that his hair seems to look lighter. I thought it was jet black (or really close to black) but now it looks like a warm and dark chestnut. I also feel stupid now, he got a B+ in the subject I did the worst in and said he wasn&rsquo;t smart. Brb crying in a corner now.</p>

<h4 id="jake-why">JAKE WHY</h4>

<p>Today the family and I were eating a nice, quiet dinner and then Homestuck got updated. I know this because my dad suddenly said, &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; It was the sound of my laptop blasting Cascade, the song my update checking software plays every time there&rsquo;s a new Homestuck update. I wanted to go turn it off but my mom was all, &ldquo;No! Stay at the dinner table, no one&rsquo;s supposed to leave until we&rsquo;re all done eating!&rdquo; So we spent the rest of the dinner awkwardly talking over Cascade while I was drowning in tons of Cascade related feels.</p>

<h4 id="holy-crap-that-upd8">HOLY CRAP, THAT UPD8</h4>

<p>KARKAT IS BACK. HOLY ADKHFJKLASDHFKLAJSHF. YES. BBY I MISS YOU. I MISS ALL THE TROLLS. VRISKA WHERE ARE YOUUUU.</p>

<p>WAIT IS HE TALKING INTO A LOBSTER.</p>

<p>(Note: This is a typical Tumblr post for me. Yeah. Tumblr culture is significantly different than the sophisticated blogosphere).</p>

<h4 id="i-m-srsly-so-stupid">I&rsquo;m srsly so stupid</h4>

<p>My chem lab partner is kinda cute, hahahahahaha</p>

<p>*flied out the window*</p>

<p>But I seriously ruined our lab experiment and I just. WHY??</p>

<h4 id="i-take-reading-week-seriously">I take reading week seriously</h4>

<p>I went to the library today and got some awesome possum books. I was delighted to see that my local library had the &ldquo;blind date with a book&rdquo; booth set up. So I picked one up. It was labelled as &ldquo;a wonderfully woven tapestry&rdquo; or something like that. At first I was like, OH GOD A BOOK ABOUT TAPESTRIES HOW HARD CORE IS THAT THIS BOOK SPEAKS TO ME. But it&rsquo;s actually a book about India. That&rsquo;s cool too, but I was disappointed. One day I&rsquo;m going to write a book about five little old ladies in a tapestry weaving club. Now <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> hard core. (I&rsquo;m not even joking I&rsquo;ve got the whole thing planned out).</p>

<h4 id="always-there">Always there</h4>

<p>To the man and his son who I never fail to see every Saturday sitting in front of the religious books whenever I go to Fish Creek,</p>

<p>I assume the worst. The public library is public after all. The first two times I saw you two sitting there, I thought nothing of it. But both times neither of you were looking at the books. This time you were just holding your son, both of you in your own world. I don&rsquo;t know your story. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re always here. But I hope that whatever happens in your life, it will only be good things.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-you-from">Where are you from?</h4>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> Where are you from?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Canada</p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> No like, where are you from?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Canada???</p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> NO. WHERE. ARE. YOU. FROM?</p>

<p>I got this question asked to me yesterday. Twice. I decided to not be sassy and just said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Filipino. I was born here.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s funny whenever people ask me that question. Kinda like how they assume everyone&rsquo;s an immigrant (which is technically true if you go far back enough and if you&rsquo;re not First Nations).</p>

<h4 id="those-midterms-gfdi">Those midterms gfdi</h4>

<p>I had two midterms today. Pretty sure I failed both of them. I&rsquo;m 100% sure I&rsquo;ll do better on the remaining midterms though because I actually know what&rsquo;s going on in those courses.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird how that after I write I write a hard test, I am filled with self loathing. Not just the &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;m so stupid why do I procrastinate I hate myself&rdquo; self loathing you&rsquo;d expect after an academic failure but the &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;m a horrible person like that one time I said a bad thing about that one person x years ago&rdquo; kind of self loathing. I don&rsquo;t understand how that works.</p>

<h4 id="can-t-wait-for-summer">Can&rsquo;t wait for summer!</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s official. We&rsquo;re going to the Philippines for the month of May! My mom just picked up the plane tickets a couple of days ago. I&rsquo;m super excited. I can&rsquo;t wait. I just need to get through this gosh darn awful semester first. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll happen&hellip;</p>

<p>My New Year&rsquo;s resolutions aren&rsquo;t going so well. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve broken at least half of them already! But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m giving up on them. I&rsquo;m starting fresh this week, and I will get stuff done.</p>

<p>This week is going to be tough. I have two midterms on subjects that I have absolutely no idea on what&rsquo;s going on. I didn&rsquo;t study as much as I wanted to on the weekend. I went to a 3 hour review session which helped a little bit and doing some homework assignments served as a nice review but still not enough.</p>

<p>Last night I had a weird existential mini-crisis. You know, the whole &ldquo;omg what am I doing with my life I&rsquo;m going to turn out to be a crazy old cat lady living in my parent&rsquo;s basement, that is, if I don&rsquo;t kill myself first&rdquo; spiel. I spent an hour crying and dwelling on my feelings and I felt extremely better afterwards. The downside was that I spent an hour on this whereas I should have spent an hour doing my homework. So it&rsquo;s like 11:45 at night, my assignment&rsquo;s due in 14 minutes, and I still had two questions left to do. A Linkin Park song comes to mind. &ldquo;I tried so hard, and I got so far. But in the end, it didn&rsquo;t even matter.&rdquo; Yeah I got through halfway of one of the questions and ran out of time. Let&rsquo;s just say that I took home a 39% with me that night.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m taking this blog post to repeat my <del>vows, I mean,</del> resolutions that I need to work on.</p>

<p>The beginning on January was nice. I posted a lot then. Not so much for the rest of January.</p>

<h2 id="3-spend-only-an-hour-per-week-on-tumblr">3. Spend only an hour per week on Tumblr</h2>

<p>I defs broke this resolution this weekend. But I&rsquo;m giving up Tumblr for Lent (which starts this Wednesday) so it&rsquo;ll get better, and fast! I just need to queue about 60 more posts and I&rsquo;m good for the next 40+ days.</p>

<h2 id="5-don-t-skip-any-lectures">5. Don&rsquo;t skip any lectures</h2>

<p>I skipped one lecture. I&rsquo;m a horrible person, I know. We had a guest lecturer (who just happened to be the Dean) and apparently it wasn&rsquo;t that helpful anyway for one of my classmates slept through it.</p>

<h2 id="6-stop-doing-assignments-the-day-before">6. Stop doing assignments the day before</h2>

<p>Why do all of my assignments have to be due on Sunday and/or Monday?? I leave everything to the weekend because I&rsquo;m too busy doing nothing during the week.</p>

<h2 id="12-3-0-gpa-for-this-semester">12. 3.0 GPA for this semester</h2>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t happening. I&rsquo;ve failed a couple of quizzes here and there. But I&rsquo;ll try to get as high as I can.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just realized that my assignment is actually due tonight, not yesterday night. What a relief!</p>
