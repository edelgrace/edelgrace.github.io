<p>A new year, a new set of resolutions, probably another year where said resolutions are never fulfilled. But it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to at least dream, yeah? Usually most people do these resolution posts on the first day of the year, but I do mine second! No, I was busy with the opening of <a href="http://thelibrariancode.com">my new blog</a>, go check it out. On with the post!</p>

<h2 id="1-post-more">1. Post more</h2>

<p>I hate how this has to be a resolution, but yes, I want to post more. Mostly for my sanity and to make sure that the money I spend on domains are actually worth it (broke university student is broke, I need a job). Plus, I want to look back on my blogs and read my posts and reminisce because I like reminiscing.</p>

<h2 id="2-catch-up-on-my-book-log-at-least-a-little">2. Catch up on my book log, at least a little</h2>

<p>In my <a href="/getting-through-it/">last blog post</a>, one of my goals for the Christmas break was to catch on my book log, <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">Room 304</a>. My total goal for this year is to add 200 hundred more books to the database.</p>

<h2 id="3-spend-only-an-hour-per-week-on-tumblr">3. Spend only an hour per week on Tumblr</h2>

<p>Last week I spent 3 hours on Tumblr, which is AMAZING compared to my all time record of 12 hours of Tumblr during a <strong>school</strong> week. I&rsquo;m a bit ashamed of that statistic. I&rsquo;ve been trying to post less and browse less so hopefully that 3 hours will dwindle down to less than an hour soon! So far, it&rsquo;s Wednesday and I&rsquo;ve already spent 1 hour on Tumblr, but some of this week wasn&rsquo;t 2013 so I&rsquo;ll let that slide. But no more Tumblr for the rest of the week!</p>

<h2 id="4-don-t-gain-weight-lose-more-than-5-pounds">4. Don&rsquo;t gain weight/lose more than 5 pounds</h2>

<p>Most of my days are spent sitting around &ldquo;doing&rdquo; school work or trying to get ahead in programming languages. As you can guess, the pounds have been adding up. I&rsquo;m short so even gaining a pound shows (unfortunately). I want to stay the weight I am now, but if I start unintentionally losing weight (haha that&rsquo;s funny), I don&rsquo;t want to lose too much weight. Five pounds sounds like a good number.</p>

<h2 id="5-don-t-skip-any-lectures">5. Don&rsquo;t skip any lectures</h2>

<p>Last semester I spent a lot of time &ldquo;rearranging&rdquo; lecture time to work on labs or projects (ENGG 200/design was a pain in the butt) or studying for mid-terms. I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that but the temptation is too great. Especially when you find yourself sitting in a lecture that should have 200+ students but only 3 rows of seats are filled and the professor isn&rsquo;t making any sense.</p>

<h2 id="6-stop-doing-assignments-the-day-before">6. Stop doing assignments the day before</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m so guilty of doing this. Last semester a lot of my assignments were due either on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. As a result, a lot of procrastination was done. I need to get out of this habit and quick.</p>

<h2 id="8-be-productive-during-reading-week">8. Be productive during reading week</h2>

<p>Reading week is a &ldquo;week&rdquo;/period preceding examinations according to Wikipedia. Last semester, reading week came along and I was so pumped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do so much studying and do all of my homework!&rdquo; Did it happen? Nope.</p>

<h2 id="9-actually-finish-some-reading-challenges">9. Actually finish some reading challenges</h2>

<p>Click <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/2012-reading-challenges">here</a> and look at my pitiful attempt at all of those reading challenges. I want to read a lot of books in 2012 but nope, that didn&rsquo;t happen. I&rsquo;m only doing 2 challenges this year, the A-Z challenge and to read 100 books (manga and novels).</p>

<h2 id="10-make-something-for-github">10. Make something for GitHub</h2>

<p>I made a GitHub account but it&rsquo;s very empty and lonely. I need something to work on as a side project. I just want something <strong>there</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="11-keep-in-touch-with-my-spiritual-side">11. Keep in touch with my spiritual side</h2>

<p>In light of all of the crazy things going around me, I want to always keep in mind of the bigger (spiritual) picture. It&rsquo;s so easy to lose focus. Admittedly, I haven&rsquo;t been the most &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; person ever but I hope that will change.</p>

<h2 id="12-3-0-gpa-for-this-semester">12. 3.0 GPA for this semester</h2>

<p>If other people can do it, so can I! I&rsquo;m aiming for the 3.0. It will come. IT WILL. No longer shall I be dangerously tip toeing the line between passing and failing!</p>

<h2 id="13-get-a-summer-job">13. Get a summer job</h2>

<p>This is the most important one. I have no volunteer (unless altar serving counts) or work experience. How awful would that look if it stayed that way until I graduated? I need a summer job. Thank goodness summer is so long (four months, thank you so much). Hopefully I can actually find a job with my lack of experience&hellip;</p>

<p>Christmas break is here and so is a new layout. It&rsquo;s not my own, but I was just enamored by it&rsquo;s simplicity. Enjoy! Whew, I finally made it through my very first semester in university. I must say, it was quite a ride. I&rsquo;m glad I got through it. Finals are behind me and now I can just relax. Even though I do want to take this time to chill out and slow down the pace, I also want to be productive. I know, I know. What is there to be productive for? School&rsquo;s done for the semester! I&rsquo;ve actually got a couple of things that I want to accomplish during the break. In fact, I&rsquo;ve actually done a couple of those things already.</p>

<h2 id="get-my-id">Get my ID</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have an ID yet, mainly because I haven&rsquo;t bothered getting my drivers permit. I&rsquo;m really far behind on that, maybe this summer I&rsquo;ll get it (I say that all summer, every summer). Not having an ID is quite concerning, considering that I&rsquo;ll be 18 before the year ends. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a clubbing or party person, but I don&rsquo;t want to be caught in a situation where I need an ID and I don&rsquo;t have it. Plus, I&rsquo;m pretty sure there has to be some law out there saying that I need to have one on my person at all times.</p>

<h2 id="renew-my-library-card">Renew my library card</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m definitely getting my library card renewed! After I get my ID, that is. Once I&rsquo;m legally an adult, I need photo ID to renew my library card. I can no longer rely on my parents to provide that information for me (sad face). Going along with the theme of libraries, I want to work at the library. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be at a public library but any library would be good. I wish I had pushed harder for working at a university library when there was an opening there. My parents didn&rsquo;t want me working during university but now I&rsquo;m going to try a bit harder to convince them otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="clean-out-all-of-my-e-mail-inboxes">Clean out all of my e-mail inboxes</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how or why I accumulate as much e-mail as I do. I have around five e-mail accounts, not including all of my admin@domain.com e-mails. Prior to deleting all the unimportant e-mails, each of my accounts had around 1,000 to 2,000 (unread) e-mails, not including the ones that I <strong>have</strong> read. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy. Plus there&rsquo;s all the folders that I had to go through to weed out things that are out of date, and such. Call me crazy or not, but I actually did this all of yesterday. Thank goodness for the &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; and &ldquo;filter&rdquo; functions in Hotmail and Gmail. Who knew that I had 300+ e-mails from Tumblr telling me &ldquo;x&rdquo; person followed me, liked this, reblogged that, asked this, and replied to that?</p>

<h2 id="forwarding-all-of-my-e-mail-to-one-account">Forwarding all of my e-mail to one account</h2>

<p>Having more than five accounts across multiple domains is tough to keep track out. I migrated all of my e-mails to one account on Gmail. Gmail&rsquo;s filters is awesome for sorting mail into different labels so I can know which e-mail came from where. Plus, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to forward mail too! The only thing I have to do left is to forward all of my university mail, but for some reason it isn&rsquo;t working. I&rsquo;ll have to work on that later.</p>

<h2 id="catch-up-at-least-a-little-bit-with-my-book-log">Catch up (at least a little bit) with my book log</h2>

<p>To those who don&rsquo;t know, I have a <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">book log</a>. I&rsquo;m seriously so far behind with it! On <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> I have just over 1,200 books on my profile. I have 52 books logged in my book log. If this was Tumblr, I&rsquo;d insert an obligatory *shrieks and flies into the sun* somewhere into this paragraph. I&rsquo;m hoping to at least get a hundred books into the database before the Christmas break is over.</p>

<h2 id="website-clean-up">Website clean up</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like taking out some time to do some website clean up. I have so many websites, and I really need to consolidate everything because quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t have time for all of them (not that I did in the first place, haha). I&rsquo;ve narrowed it down to two websites and two other websites that require very little maintenance. Right now I have around around eight or nine. Yeah, some of those got to go!</p>

<h2 id="hush-hush-project">Hush hush project</h2>

<p>One of the four websites that I&rsquo;m keeping will actually be a new website. That means I&rsquo;m letting go of five or six of my current websites. I don&rsquo;t want to say too much about the website now, but I can guarantee that it will be up on New Years!</p>

              </ul>
          </div>

          <p><p>Two blog posts in a week?? Is this even possible? I&rsquo;m probably dreaming but it&rsquo;s happening. For real.</p>

<p>Whenever I first get on the computer, I find myself starting out pretty darn focused. I open up Blackboard, see what&rsquo;s new, check my falling grades, cry, start on my assignments, etc. Then suddenly it&rsquo;s 1 in the morning (I&rsquo;m exaggerating, the latest I&rsquo;ve started homework was like 10pm&hellip; Still pretty bad though). So yeah, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;1 in the morning.&rdquo; I have a couple assignments due in a couple of hours and all I&rsquo;ve done was look at fanart of grey kids with horns. My first thought whenever this happens is, &ldquo;Where did all of my time go??&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried tracking the usage of my time before. I used a program called RescueTime but it was too broad. It told me what programs I was using and a few select sites that I frequented but it wasn&rsquo;t enough! Then I downloaded <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timestats/ejifodhjoeeenihgfpjijjmpomaphmah">timeStats</a> last week for Chrome.</p>

<p>Okay, this is a beautiful plugin. It&rsquo;s really easy to use too! Install it and wait and see how much time you waste on YouTube.</p>

<p>But what I really love about this little thing is the categories option. Every single website you visit is stored and you categorize them into your own categories. I made three of them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Productive:</strong> The websites I want to be on. Such as my assignment websites and general uni stuff. Wolfram alpha may or may not be in this category&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>Potential time wasters:</strong> You know those sites that you go on with a purpose but then one hour later, you&rsquo;re still on said site without having fulfilled said purpose? Yeah, those sites.</li>
<li><strong>Time wasters:</strong> YouTube. Tumblr. Twitter. Facebook. Blogs. My blogs. My websites. Anything that can distract me for HOURS from my school work. Sadly, there are a lot of them&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Categories.png"><img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Categories-300x160.png" alt="Category breakdown" title="Categories" width="300" height="160" class="left" /></a></p>

<p>This plugin is really handy in that it displays the data clearly in pie charts and graphs. I&rsquo;m a sucker for pie charts and graphs. So let&rsquo;s look at my Internet usage in terms of these categories for the past week. Now these percentages probably don&rsquo;t mean anything to you so I&rsquo;ll quantify them even further. In other words, I&rsquo;ve spent 22:54 hours on time wasting sites, 11:17 hours on productive sites, and 6:30 hours on potential time wasting sites. I&rsquo;ve spent almost a day a week wasting my time. A day. For every productive hour, I spend two hours doing nothing. That&rsquo;s&hellip; Really discouraging. I mean I know I procrastinate a lot but I didn&rsquo;t know I procrastinated this much. The next burning question in my mind was, what sites do I spend most of my time on? And yes, timeStats gives you the answer to this too!</p>

<p><a href="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sites.png"><img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sites-300x156.png" alt="" title="Sites" width="300" height="156" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>Okay, well I already know the site I visit the most. <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. I spend an ungodly amount of my time on the damned website. A total of 11:50 hours this week. Microblogging is just so fast and easy. And most of all: addictive. All I&rsquo;m doing is looking at pictures people have shared with me and clicking a button to share it with other people. Probably the lowest form of &ldquo;blogging&rdquo; there ever is. But I do it anyway.</p>

<p>The second most visited site is a good one though, with a total of 4:42 hours. MathXL is my homework site for calculus. It&rsquo;s kinda sad that I&rsquo;ve spent 5 hours doing one assignment though. It was a fairly easy assignment too. I&rsquo;ve lost all faith in my calculus abilities&hellip; Not that I had much faith in them to begin with.</p>

<p>Google Docs is seriously SO HANDY for group projects that involve presentations and final reports. It&rsquo;s so much easier that way! <a href="http://mspaintadventures.com">MS Paint Adventures</a> is the website that hosts the web comic, Homestuck. Don&rsquo;t go there. There are over 7000 pages over silly shenanigans that are way too easily to get lost in. <a href="http://www.zachleat.com">Zachleat</a> has a useful alarm app that can play a YouTube video at full blast when it goes off. I use it a lot, apparently. More than I thought I ever did anyway. I also post a lot on the forums over at <a href="ubi.com">Ubi</a>. About the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed series. It&rsquo;s a good game, okay?? And the rest of the sites are pretty straightforward. Like Facebook, for example. It&rsquo;s evil.</p>

<p>So yes, my findings with this little plugin is this: I spend too much time doing irrelevant shi&hellip;take mushrooms on the Internet. But I&rsquo;m working on it! First off by limiting my Tumblr use. Although most of my attempts are like this:</p>

<p>Me: Go away Tumblr, I don&rsquo;t need you anymore. All you do is CAUSE ME PAIN.</p>

<p>Tumblr: Ok bye.</p>

<p>Me: Just kidding. I can&rsquo;t live without you. Never leave me. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?? COME BACK HERE!</p>

<p>Yeah okay I have finals to study for. Bye for now!</p>

          <p><p>Usually I bring a textbook with me on the train to study from but today I had only one lecture and I definitely forgot to bring one. So I decided it would be good to write a blog post for once because I really do miss writing these things.</p>

<p>Christmas is indeed in the air! Last week in the food court on campus, Christmas carols were playing and a Santa was walking around asking for donations for some charity. I&rsquo;m definitely in the holiday spirits!</p>

<p>My dad though is a Christmas fanatic. On the first of November, we put our Christmas tree up. Yeah. The <strong>first of November</strong>. The family was all home for once and my brother and I put up the decorations on the tree while mom sang Christmas songs and my dad took pictures of us. It was really festive but really way to early to do those things (I had fun either way).</p>

<p>Around two weeks ago he put up the Christmas lights. We got some really long Christmas lights from a family friend because they moved to a condo. My dad put the lights on top of the fence, around all the windows, and even on my little evergreen tree (&ldquo;little&rdquo; even though it&rsquo;s taller than me&hellip; And I&rsquo;m the older one!). As well, my dad plays the Christmas station all the time! I&rsquo;m serious. When he&rsquo;s driving, it&rsquo;s all he listens to. And whenever he&rsquo;s home and not sleeping, he&rsquo;s listening to it. In the morning he boosts up the volume until it&rsquo;s deafeningly loud to wake us up.</p>

<p>He also loves telling us about Christmas in the Philippines. When he was younger he&rsquo;d go caroling door to door for food. And then they&rsquo;d go play outside until midnight and light fireworks and firecrackers. It&rsquo;s really cute when my dad gets in the holiday spirit. It runs off on me too!</p>

<p>Even though I am feeling the holiday cheer, I am absolutely dreading the days as they pass by. Why?</p>

<p>Finals.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of season again! My first final is this Monday, and I&rsquo;m kind of terrified. Programming is pretty easy if you do all the labs and pay attention. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll at least pass that one. The other ones&hellip; I&rsquo;m not so sure! I&rsquo;m taking a course which is kind of like chemistry. I always just seem to let it slip amongst everything else. There&rsquo;s no mandatory homework except for labs and I never do any practice problems or anything. Mostly because I do have mandatory homework in the rest of my classes and I just don&rsquo;t bother about my chemistry-like course. It&rsquo;s really bad, I know. As much as I&rsquo;d like to study that and only that until the exam, I&rsquo;d probably fail the rest of my exams. Oh well, I&rsquo;ll just do what I can, I guess!</p>

          <p><p>I have a whole load of things to do this weekend. Not sure if I&rsquo;ll actually get around to doing those said things. But at least my midterms are finally over! But finals start up in two weeks. Huh. Now that I&rsquo;ve made a list of things I need to, it doesn&rsquo;t really seem like that much but considering my procrastination habits, it is quite a lot. Weekends are for relaxing, not for drowning myself in tears. Funny how my calculus teacher in high school once said that his roommates in university only did homework on Sunday afternoons. 12 hours is not enough to do homework anymore. And I definitely started typing &ldquo;homestuck&rdquo; instead of homework, Hussie what are you doing to me? So yeah, here&rsquo;s my list of things to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computers post-lab</li>
<li>Computers pre-lab</li>
<li>Computers in-lab</li>
<li>Behaviour of liquids, solids, and gases lab</li>
<li>Calculus homework</li>
<li>Linear algebra homework</li>
<li>Start studying for finals</li>
<li>Work on video game project for design</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a list of things I want to do. Sadly, only one of those things are present on my things I need to do list. It looks like I got my work cut out for me, yeah?</p>

<ul>
<li>Read lots and lots of Homestuck</li>
<li>Work on video game project for design</li>
<li>Replay some Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 (I actually want to read pay more attention to what&rsquo;s happening at least try to)</li>
<li>Write a review/reaction/long ass rant about Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 (I have a lot of feelings about this franchise)</li>
<li>Work on my database of books</li>
<li>Work on other things that require coding of the HTML considering I haven&rsquo;t done that in a while</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a list of what I&rsquo;m doing right now. Gosh darn it, I&rsquo;m so productive.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>Neopets</li>
<li>Reading Homestuck</li>
<li>Thinking of starting my behaviour of liquids, solids, and gases lab</li>
</ul>

<p>I spend too much on Tumblr, it&rsquo;s so addicting. I used to scoff at the idea of micro-blogging but now every time I want to make a really long wall of text, I go straight to Tumblr instead of here. It kinda makes me sad. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s more accessible for my friends. But why do I even want my friends to know about the stuff I do? I think it&rsquo;s some weird social media thing. Like how on Facebook you make your life seem more interesting than it really is. That&rsquo;s kinda like what I used Tumblr for. Tumblr is like a giant mess of my thoughts. If you want to know what I&rsquo;m currently obsessing about, Tumblr is the place to look. It&rsquo;s just really good cathartic way of expressing myself. Social media, why must you do this to me?</p>
