      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s my boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday coming up soon. I wanted to make him a knitted or a crocheted item because I need something to keep my hands busy. Plus aren&amp;rsquo;t handmade things the sweetest thing you could get as a present??
On some level, I know he&amp;rsquo;s a little picky about what kind of things he would like to wear. To avoid spending a ton of time working on something that he might not ever wear, I sent him a couple links to patterns of scarves and toques.</description>

      <description>An example screenshot of Hungry Tyrtle   The &amp;ldquo;Problem&amp;rdquo; The goal of this project was to design a button that would delight its user and respect some aspects of their personality. In this case, the user was a fellow classmate of mine. After some interviewing, I determined the following:
 She watches a lot of movies but no horror or rom coms please She has a double major in psychology and lingusitics She wants a pet box turtle and a cat named Aang (like from Avatar: The Last Airbender) She works a lot and enjoys it (just wishes she would get paid more) She listens to a lot of podcasts some which are movie related and some are DnD related (but she&amp;rsquo;s never played DnD before) She likes the X-men!</description>

      <title>Hello World (Hugo)</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with Hugo lately. A couple of weeks ago, I exported my old Wordpress blog into Hugo. While I am happy with the results, it&amp;rsquo;s taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I&amp;rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.
So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site.</description>
