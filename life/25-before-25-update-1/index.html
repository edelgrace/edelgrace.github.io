              <p>I took a little break during the month of May. My mental health was honestly at an all time low and I found myself having a hard time picking myself back up to get motivated to actually do things. Since I am around 6 months into my 22nd year of living, I thought it would be a good time to pause and reflect how I&rsquo;m doing with my 25 before 25. I only two and a half years left after all.</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong>: Good progress</p>

<p>I am on track with this, thankfully! So far I am passing all of my courses and seem to look good to graduate at the end of the year. I still need to register for one more course in September but I&rsquo;m having trouble finding a course that I am interested in that won&rsquo;t conflict with other courses.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents’ house</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>My moving out fund is slowly getting chipped away due to paying for tuition. I still need a job secured for this summer. I really want to get one ASAP so I can get that cash flow going.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>When I was on internship, I put most of my paycheque into my TFSA. I still have a ways to go before maxing out my TFSA but I definitely have the funds in there. They will not be touched for a while.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open a RRSP account</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This won&rsquo;t happen until I get a semi-permanent job and I don&rsquo;t see that happening until I graduate. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This also won&rsquo;t happen until I graduate.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong>: Good progress</p>

<p>This year I have read around 36 books. There are still half a year left so I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m ahead of the game for this year.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong>: Little progress</p>

<p>I started playing The Witcher 3 and unfortunately, most of my gaming time has been spent on that. This has been a good reminder for me to boot up Origins sometime soon.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to code lately but I need to get started planning this seriously. Maybe I will dedicate this weekend to do so.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>As said before, haven&rsquo;t done a lot of coding this year. I also need to draw a good plan for this.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Woah, look at all these projects I haven&rsquo;t started on yet. I need to figure out which project to prioritize first. This website has been a long time coming but the TCG will be the most work. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver’s license</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Have yet to sit in the driver&rsquo;s seat yet this year. I have to check my learner&rsquo;s permit and see when it expires. I need a teacher and my poor father is reluctant to teach me because I am unsafe.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong>: Negligible progress</p>

<p>My mental health stumbling block last month has done a lot for me to trip up on this. I am struggling with making friends in general right now and I&rsquo;m finding it extremely hard. I started going to crochet meetups and will hopefully go regularly enough to make a friend or two.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>In May I felt like I regressed a lot but I am starting to go back to the gym. Yesterday I went to the gym on campus and my nerves only got me to do some cardio on the machines but I did something which was relieving.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Nope. Hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. Starting today.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water.</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>When I was sitting around at work, I was drinking a lot of water. Now back at school, I&rsquo;m finding it hard to remember to drink water. In fact, I&rsquo;m thirsty right now. I will go and get some water right now. Water break!</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong>: Little progress</p>

<p>My mom left the country to go the Philippines in May. I got some opportunities to cook. Just really small things. Made pizza, chicken wings, breakfast. Nothing hardcore.</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I need that cash first and foremost.</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This summer vacation, for sure.</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong>: Almost there</p>

<p>I got tipsy once so far. It was weird. Almost there. One day.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I kinda gave up my CCNA courses so I just might start to study on my own.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the start of summer so I will have to wait until winter comes back around to go to Zoo Lights.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>I am currently doing some counseling to combat this. Also taking part of an online cognitive behavioural therapy course. Exercise will hopefully help as well.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m such a bad pen pal. 🙁 Gah! I don&rsquo;t have a P.O. box anymore and I&rsquo;m not entirely comfortable not using one. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t seen any concerts that caught my eye yet. Wait, let me check right now. Nope, nothing catches my eye at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>I watched Ella Enchanted. That&rsquo;s one out of many, right?</p>

While I am happy with the results, it&rsquo;s taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I&rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.
So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I follow the blog baty.net in which Jack Baty continuously finds new tools and new ways to improve his productivity. While I usually scoff at people who are always changing things up, I will admit that I am the exact same way. It would be great to just stick to something tried and true and never have to think about changing but there is just so much out there that it&rsquo;s hard for me to resist the temptation to not try everything I can see.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">FO stands for &ldquo;finished object.&rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</div>

He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</div>

If you don&rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!

A shocking number of people who didn&rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</div>

It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&rsquo;t win anything from but that&rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&rsquo;s great!</div>

Up to this point I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</div>

Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&rsquo;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</div>
