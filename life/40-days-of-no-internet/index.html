      <h1>40 Days of No Internet</h1>
      
      <p>Tomorrow marks the beginning of Lent. Last year I gave up Tumblr for Lent. This year I&rsquo;m giving up using the Internet (minus school things). So for the next 40 days I won&rsquo;t be posting, commenting, reading, e-mailing, Twittering, Facebooking or anything that has to do with the Internet. My poor Neopets are going to starve to almost death (that&rsquo;s the the first thought that came to my mind, how sad). I&rsquo;m not sure if I can do it but hopefully I can. I enjoy testing my discipline but I always feel frustrated when I&rsquo;m tempted. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I got my diploma results back. In my province, anyone taking grade twelve courses have to take diplomas, which are basically just final exams.</p>

<p>So the mail came and I stared at the envelope. I opened it in a frenzy and just held the piece of paper. I was scared to open it. When I did, I let out a sigh of relief. I got 86% on my math diploma, well above the 75% I was expecting. My overall mark for math went down 1% which I&rsquo;m thoroughly grateful for. Now chemistry is a whole different story. My mark dropped 6 whole percentages which kinda sucked but I did better than the 70% I thought I would get. I got a 78% which is decent considering <strike>how much I studied</strike> the lack of studying I did (16 hours including diploma prep).</p>

<p>Yeah. A lot my friends did amazingly well, which I&rsquo;m kind of jealous about. Like in the 90s range! Guhh, I wish I studied harder, especially for chemistry. At least I still meet the requirements for engineering which is my main goal, as many of you already know.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s it for today. Goodnight!</p>
