      <h1>9 Years of Blogging</h1>
      
      <p>Okay, I know that probably isn&rsquo;t a lot compared to other bloggers out there but to me, that&rsquo;s mind blowing. 9 years is around 40% of my life and that percentage will only keep on increasing. Assuming that I continue blogging. As long as I can type, I don&rsquo;t think I would stop blogging. Sure, my blogging might be extremely sporadic but it&rsquo;s still blogging to me.</p>

<p>Actually, I was going through my archive and I read <a href="http://scattered.me/2007/02/bouncy/">a blog post</a> that was from exactly six years and two days ago. That&rsquo;s <strong>3289</strong> days ago. I laughed to myself abouut how some things just don&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t posted in a while.&rdquo;</em> This is me like every single time I post something. How is this still true even today? &ldquo;I need to post more,&rdquo; I say to myself every year.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too much of a perfectionist.&rdquo;</em> My second most fatal flaw. My first being that I&rsquo;m a procrastinator, which I&rsquo;m 99.9% sure that I was one back then. It&rsquo;s honestly the deadliest combination against productivity.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;My mom keeps complaining on how Iâ€™m &#8216;losing weight.&lsquo;&rdquo;</em> I literally got into a (civil) argument with my mom about my weight yesterday. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get toned (hence all the recent fitness posts) because I have always been conscious of my large gut. I&rsquo;m at a perfect weight for my height I just want to reduce my body fat percentage to get that flat stomach look. They say doing so is 80% diet and 20% exercise. I don&rsquo;t mind gaining weight through muscles.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Live performances always rekindle my love for a band.&rdquo;</em> Just recently I&rsquo;ve been <strong>obsessed</strong> with the post-hardcore Canadian band Alexisonfire. This was because, by some chance, I watched an hour long concert on YouTube of theirs from last year. It was mind blowing how perfect they were in that concert. I used to like Alexisonfire a lot when I was in junior high but watching this concert made my love for them grow tenfold. I never realized how great they were as a band.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I am so tired right now.&rdquo;</em> They say nine years later that she is still tired today.</p>
