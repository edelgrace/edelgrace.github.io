      <h1>Almost Happy Birthday</h1>
      
      <p>My birthday is in four days! I&rsquo;ll finally be thirteen! I have had it with people staring at me and going, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still twelve?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s annoying. I&rsquo;m not the only twelve year old in grade eight!</p>

<p>One of my friends is already fourteen! She can get her learner&rsquo;s permit nd she cant get over the fact she&rsquo;s two years older than me. At least I&rsquo;m not like my one friend. HHe doesnt turn thirteen until February.</p>

<p>Another great thing: in three days my cousin is coming to Canada! I&rsquo;m excited because she&rsquo;s from way back in the Philippines and I haven&rsquo;t seen her since fourth grade. But it&rsquo;s kinda complicated with her. My mom booked the flight without asking her mom but I was the one who asked if she could come before or on my brithday. I want her to play laser quest with me and my friends on sunday.</p>

<p>I got an iPod nano today! I was really surprised because I didnt even ask for an iPod nano, and its not christmas anymore. Whatever.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m listening to an awesome song. Sweet Child O&rsquo; Mine by Guns N&rsquo; Roses</p>

<p>I love December.</p>
