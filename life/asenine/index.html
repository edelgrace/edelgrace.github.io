      <p>I usually don&rsquo;t post on weekends, even though it&rsquo;s when I have the most free time. Even with free time I&rsquo;m usually wasting it, haha. Although today, I did something somewhat productive, which was retweak the layout! I&rsquo;m not sure if you lot like it, but I do. The fancy @font-face works well, haha. As you can see, I used a font in several place. It&rsquo;s called <em>Asenine</em>. I love this font, and that word. I think I went overkill on it. But no matter. Also, I made the layout wider, centered some things a bit, made things bigger, etc. I had fun with it.</p>

<p>If you look at the sidebar, you&rsquo;ll see that I have watered it down, and added a <em>Tumblr Feed</em> widget. I&rsquo;m usually on Tumblr a lot, so you guys can see what I like to post from time to time. Right now it&rsquo;s a fyeahbandbuffalo picture. It&rsquo;s so relevant to my life, it&rsquo;s not even funny.</p>

<p>A little update on me. I&rsquo;ve been getting into Neopets lately, LOL. Someone mentioned it to me so I thought, I want to play that again! So I did. And now I&rsquo;m addicted. I named all my pets after my favourite celebrities&hellip; Oh my, what has become of my Internet life? Neopets and Tumblr!</p>

<p>Some other internet things. I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot more online comics lately. Wow, there are so many talented and dedicated people out there! My favourite ones at the moments are <a href="http://nopinkponies.keenspot.com/">No Pink Ponies</a>, <a href="http://myth.smackjeeves.com/">MYth</a>, and <a href="http://yourrhapsody.smackjeeves.com">Your Rhapsody</a> (although it&rsquo;s barely started). I have no idea how some people can draw magnificent masterpieces once or twice a week. It looks like it takes a really long time. I really adore those kinds of people. I wish I could draw well. I just draw as a hobby.</p>

<p>Anyway, I really should be getting back to studying. I have three unit tests this weeks. Egads. Wish me luck!</p>
