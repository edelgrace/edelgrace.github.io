      <h1>At the Library #1</h1>
      
      <p>Technically this is the second trip to the library this year but this is the first post about it.</p>

<p>Right after I finished my chemistry diploma exam on Thursday, my dad drove me to the library. I felt at home, how sad, haha. Usually I go upstairs to the teen section, but oh ho, not this time! I went straight to the adult comics section. I&rsquo;m quite the rebel, I know. I mostly check to see if they have the last volume of <em>Mushishi</em> by Yuki Urushibara. They never do, but gah, I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>

<p>After that check, I go straight to see if there any books I haven&rsquo;t read in the P and M section to get my fix of Jodi Picoult and Haruki Murakami. Then I quickly scan the bookshelves to see if there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s on my to-read list. After that, I head up to the teens section. I scan the shelves again and then carefully inspect the comic book shelves. I&rsquo;ve pretty much read all the comics I want to read in the section but you never know.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my library list for that day. I&rsquo;m trying to lessen my loads as not to make it so intimidating to get through. And so I can minimalize the amount of books I return unread. I hate doing that&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/series/moon-boy">Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)</a> by Lee Young-You</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve read a some of this series and has been curious ever since then. I saw most of the volumes on the shelves but told myself to only get the first three instead of the first seven.</li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/cirque-du-freak-volume-7/">Cirque du Freak (Volume 7)</a> by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai</strong></p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s not a series I&rsquo;m extremely devoted to, it throws in some variety into my reading.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/perfect-match/">Perfect Match</a> by Jodi Picoult</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on a quest to read every single Jodi Picoult book there is.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/books/poster-boy/">Poster Boy</a> by Dede Crane</strong></p>

<p>The summary intrigued me, as I&rsquo;m always a sucker for books that deal with illnesses and the such.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Truth About Delilah Blue by Tish Cohen</strong></p>

<p>This has been on my to-read list for a while. I first saw it on display at Wal-Mart. I&rsquo;ve taken it out before but it was returned untouched.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami</strong></p>

<p>Another book I took out but returned it unfinished. I did start it but alas, I ran out of renewals on it. I&rsquo;m a new reader of Murakami&rsquo;s and have only read one of his works but I thoroughly enjoyed it and have heard great reviews for this book.</p></li>
</ul>
