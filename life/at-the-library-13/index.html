      <h1>At the Library #13</h1>
      
      <p>I recently made a trip to the library. Here&rsquo;s what I managed to grab.</p>

<p><strong>Buried in Books: A Reader&rsquo;s Anthology by Julie Rugg</strong><br />
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don&rsquo;t recall exactly why they&rsquo;re on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me. I like reading about reading, a little ironic but it&rsquo;s interesting to see how others view reading.</p>

<p><strong>Madame Tussaud by Michelle Moran</strong><br />
Yet another unknown. I think this is due to the fact that it is historical fiction involving royalty during the French Revolution.</p>

<p><strong>The Midwich Cuckoos by Jogn Wyndham</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve been trying to get into science fiction. I adored the sci-fi and fantasy genres when I was younger. I don&rsquo;t quite know what happened to my preferences. I think I got all sappy and romantic but there&rsquo;s no reason why science fiction can&rsquo;t be romantic!</p>

<p><strong>Something New by Lucy Kinsley</strong><br />
Kinsley&rsquo;s previous works were pretty good and I think her drawings are cute and quirky. I love the autobiographical element.</p>

<p><strong>Two Kisses for Maddy by Matthew Logelin</strong><br />
I always try to get some non-fiction into my library trips. My go to is always memoirs. I have yet to read a memoir involving children. Good luck. I do not predict dry eyes for this one.</p>

<p><strong>You Can Act on Camera by D.W. Brown</strong><br />
This one wasn&rsquo;t on any list but I justified it because it was such a slim volume. Seems interesting. I think the book title is lying but we&rsquo;ll see how Brown defends his claim.</p>
