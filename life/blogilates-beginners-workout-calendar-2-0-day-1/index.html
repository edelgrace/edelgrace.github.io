<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This &ldquo;review&rdquo;/blog series is NOT sponsored in any way and all opinions are entirely of my own.</p>

<p>My first post of 2016! This year I resolved to get healthier. That is, eat healthier and be more active! I&rsquo;ve been hanging out on the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/xxfitness">/r/xxfitness: Fitness for Women</a> subreddit a lot lately. Since I&rsquo;m hesitant to go to the gym, someone suggested I try <a href="http://blogilates.com">Blogilates</a>, ran by Cassey Ho. I browsed the site a bit and decided to try the <a href="http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2014/12/30/new-beginners-calendar-2-0-for-2015/">Beginner&rsquo;s Workout Calendar</a> which lasts for four weeks.</p>

<h3 id="quick-facts-about-blogilates">Quick facts about Blogilates</h3>

<ul>
<li>The majority of the content is free. Most of Cassey&rsquo;s videos are up on YouTube.</li>
<li>Subscribing to her newsletter gives you access to unique monthly workout plans.</li>
<li>There is an app, however you have to pay for her calendars but her recipes and videos are all free.</li>
<li>As far as I know, pilates is all bodyweight exercises so absolutely no equipment is needed for her videos.</li>
</ul>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<p>Cassey starts off the video with some breathing techniques, for the absolute beginners to pilates (AKA me). She then goes into the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Pilates stance:</em> This is one of the easier ones although my neck kinda hurt a little.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Apparently one roll up is equivalent to six crunches and Cassey makes you do around four of these. I struggled with doing this properly as I really do not have the strength to lift myself up from a lying position without any support. I found this one kind of fun though.</li>
<li><em>Leg stuff:</em> Okay, this part was grueling! I have a tendency to painfully cramp in my legs, so I admit I did this section half-heartedly because it felt like I was constantly on the cusp of cramping up. Maybe that&rsquo;s just the nature of the workout but hopefully it improves soon. However, some of the moves are really graceful in this one and I really admired how pretty it looked (when Cassey did it).</li>
<li><em>Cobra position:</em> These moves were like something I&rsquo;d expect from yoga.</li>
<li><em>Elbow push ups:</em> I hate push ups with a dying passion but these were not that bad. Granted, I did do the knee variant. My knees also hurt afterward.</li>
<li><em>Mermaid stretches:</em> These are rather interesting. Although, I feel like I did them wrong because I didn&rsquo;t feel a lot of stretching going on.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Man, I&rsquo;m out of shape. I didn&rsquo;t do a lot of these exercises 100% as I&rsquo;m not used to physical activity like this. However, Cassey can be really encouraging and she does offer tips on how to ease up on the difficulty if you&rsquo;re having trouble.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some people complain about Cassey&rsquo;s perkiness but I have nothing to complain about, yet. Sometimes I felt like dying and Cassey would say something like, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t nothing yet!&rdquo; and I found it kind of motivating. But we&rsquo;ll see as time goes on. I did like how Cassey would tell stories, as it (kind of) takes your mind off the fact that you feel like you&rsquo;re dying.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel sore all over but I feel really happy to have day one over and done with! Starting is always the hardest part so just getting through the first little bit is always a struggle. I&rsquo;ve read that it only gets harder from here on in but I&rsquo;m hoping that I&rsquo;ll be able to stick through with it all.</p>
