<h3 id="video-1-5-minute-fat-burner">Video 1: 5 Minute Fat Burner</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Five minutes? Easy peasey.&rdquo; I was so wrong! Cassey wasn&rsquo;t lying when she said it would be tough. This was a hard video, with lots of suffering included (guaranteed).</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Star Jump:</em> These were really hard to do quietly. I definitely started sweating immediately with this move.</li>
<li><em>In and Out Donkey Kicks:</em> All of my workout times are too inconvenient for the people in my house, haha. I tried to be really quiet so I didn&rsquo;t do the kicks too forcefully. I&rsquo;d love to be able to do these moves without worrying about sound.</li>
<li><em>Burpees:</em> I did the silent burpee version but I did add the push up. This really made me start breathing heavily. I hate burpees so much!</li>
<li><em>Mountain Climbers:</em> My feet kept slipping on the rug, haha. This was kind of fun and quick although it was pretty hard!</li>
<li><em>Split Squat Jumps:</em> I&rsquo;m sure my parents were grumbling as I was doing this move. I tried my best not to jump too high but it&rsquo;s inevitable to make some noise whenever jumping is involved.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-push-plank-challenger">Video 2: Push Plank Challenger</h3>

<p>This video is essentially just one move. One. Excruciating. Move. I did the &ldquo;beginner&rsquo;s&rdquo; version of this move but I still had trouble. My arms are sore after that! I&rsquo;m really weak&hellip; Thank goodness for this calendar!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-3-killer-legs">Video 3: Killer Legs</h3>

<p>Another short video, which is interesting&hellip; Short but KILLER, as the title would suggest. This is another video that depends on reps over a period of time. So much repetition today!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Narrow Squat Slider:</em> This move is harder than the other move, which is interesting. My legs were really feeling this one.</li>
<li><em>Narrow Squat Lifter:</em> I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s easier to lift than to simply extend me leg to the side&hellip; Maybe I didn&rsquo;t lift my leg high enough although I consciously tried to lift my legs as high as possible. Something to work on, probably.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>Three short and brutal videos today. The last video wasn&rsquo;t that bad but the first two definitely got beads of sweat rolling down my neck! I actually prefer that, for some reason. I love it when I sweat from working out. It feels like I&rsquo;m actually doing work. I didn&rsquo;t work to my fullest potential today but I was trying to keep quiet. The only time I can do my workouts are early morning or late at night. Both of those times, someone is sleeping in the house. What a dilemma&hellip; I need to figure that out.</p>
