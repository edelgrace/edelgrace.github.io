<h3 id="day-16-abs">Day 16: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay, this is the first day that I technically did not do on the right day. I started this one a little after midnight because I was working on an assignment and then I looked at the time&hellip; Whoops, the day went by fast! Today&rsquo;s videos were okay. The first video was mostly good but the second video was killer. My neck hurts more than it should.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>Not much to say about this video except for the fact that those hundreds still get me. I&rsquo;ve been looking at comments and I&rsquo;m not the only one with the same problem. I wish there was a way to fix it though!</p>

<h3 id="video-2-5-best-and-most-effective-ab-exercises">Video 2: 5 Best and Most Effective Ab Exercises</h3>

<p>I hate ab videos so much&hellip; So many of them require lifting my shoulders off the ground and it hurts my neck! I really don&rsquo;t know how to do this entire video properly.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Saturn Rings:</em> This is a really creative move. I just wish I could do them properly. The theme of this video is &ldquo;ow my neck omg HOW DO YOU DO THAT???&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have anything small and heavy with me so I just used my 3DS. I probably might have as well not used a weight at all, haha.</li>
<li><em>Weighted Roll Up:</em> I didn&rsquo;t have enough room to stretch my arm to the side so I just lifted it slightly lower than my other arm holding the &ldquo;weight.&rdquo; These were hard but definitely the easiest move in the video. I got tired which is weird for roll ups!</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> These ones are okay, maybe even easier than the weighted roll up. I&rsquo;m also doubting whether or not I&rsquo;m doing this move correctly though. I feel it more in my legs than in my abs.</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross:</em> I hate these!!! My neck seriously hurts doing these. But halfway through the move Cassey mentioned you didn&rsquo;t have to touch your knees to your elbows and that made it somewhat easier for me after making that adjustment.</li>
<li><em>Hollow Rock:</em> How??? I don&rsquo;t know how to do this move at all! When I get up and I go back down on the floor, my shoulder blades thump hard onto the floor and it hurts. I really don&rsquo;t know how Cassey does it&hellip;</li>
</ul>
