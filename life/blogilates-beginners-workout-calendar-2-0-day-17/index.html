<h3 id="day-17-total-body">Day 17: Total Body</h3>

<p>Okay, this is the first time I have skipped a day and had to make it up. I didn&rsquo;t feel too guilty about skipping yesterday because I had spin class, which is two (maybe even three) times as long and 234204398 times harder than these workouts. I enjoy spin class though, don&rsquo;t get me wrong! It&rsquo;s the only &ldquo;real&rdquo; cardio I do, unless you count Cassey&rsquo;s occasional four minute cardio videos. Also, I brisquely walked around for an hour. I was craving food and the cheapest and least caloric food is Wendy&rsquo;s (I love their $2 small chilies) which is quite a walk away and I had to get to class on time so I sped walk there and back. So yeah, the guilt was basically non-existent. I got home, ate supper, and literally went to bed at 8 and fell asleep around 9. I was pooped for some reason!</p>

<p>Anyway, overall, this &ldquo;day&rdquo; was pretty okay. A couple of hard moves but I think I can feel myself getting stronger and being more capable of performing everything. Not to say that I don&rsquo;t occasionally pause the video anymore, but I can feel it getting easier.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-burning-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Fat Burning Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>What I like about this video is that it&rsquo;s relatively quiet. I got up at 6 this morning and did these exercises as quietly as possible and was still able to get my heart rate up and my skin sweating! Since I&rsquo;ve done this warmup before, I won&rsquo;t describe all the moves. I can&rsquo;t really pick a favourite one or a least favourite one. I guess I don&rsquo;t really understand the squat curl. Like on a philosophical level. Did that make sense?</p>

<h3 id="video-2-5-best-exercises-to-flatten-your-lower-belly">Video 2: 5 Best Exercises to Flatten Your Lower Belly</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Best exercises,&rdquo; okay. I really need this video in my life, probably. I&rsquo;ve been trying to flatten my belly for years and ultimately, this is what my fitness kick is trying to accomplish! Also, I do not recommend abs/belly exercises right after you eat a big meal. Do not do it.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> Cassey really loves her double leg lifts! I think I&rsquo;ve gotten used to them. This move can go on forever though.</li>
<li><em>Reverse Crunch:</em> Okay, this move was interesting. I did enjoy it a bit but it kind of hurt on my way down.</li>
<li><em>Heel Clicks:</em> Ridiculously simple but it gets tiring really easily! I tried my best to go as low as I could but darn, it gets harder as you get lower!</li>
<li><em>Cheerleader L&rsquo;s:</em> I hate this one! It&rsquo;s pretty hard for me to keep my balance and keep my shoulders off the mat. Not going to lie, I had to resort to the beginner&rsquo;s modification.</li>
<li><em>Rocket:</em> The rocket was also hard. This one hurt a lot. It felt like my shoulders were digging into the ground. I probably just need practice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-muffin-top-massacre">Video 3: Muffin top Massacre</h3>

<p>With &ldquo;massacre&rdquo; in the title, I really was expecting worse. But I didn&rsquo;t get it! Which was surprising. For some reason I wondered why a lot of these moves were targeted to muffin tops&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know if I have muffin tops.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Elegant Candlestick:</em> This was a pretty good move. It felt like a stretch more than anything. I really pictured the candlestick from &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; while doing this move.</li>
<li><em>Truck Drivers:</em> Another pretty good move! I love the truck driver analogy. It did get tiring but I didn&rsquo;t feel it as much as the other moves. The burn was less but it totally drained some of my stamina.</li>
<li><em>Caressing Side Squeezers:</em> This was hard but I mostly made it through! Lifting myself up is the hardest part about this move, which is basically what the move is. So the hardest part was the entire thing.</li>
<li><em>Obliquatories and Flexed Obliquatories:</em> Keeping my lower leg lifted proved to be a challenge so I just kept it on the floor for most of the move. My legs definitely hurt more than whatever this move was supposed to work. Also, I&rsquo;m not sure if the name of the move is a pun or not but I approve.</li>
</ul>
