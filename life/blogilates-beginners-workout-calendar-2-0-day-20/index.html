<h3 id="day-19-total-body">Day 19: Total Body</h3>

<p>I got home today after writing a midterm and I was so tired that I was tempted to just not do the workout today but then I realized tomorrow os rest day and who wants to work out on rest day? Not me. So I decided against it and got off my butt to do it. And I&rsquo;m glad I did because today was so much easier!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-butt-lift-and-slim-thighs">Video 1: Butt Lift and Slim Thighs</h3>

<p>I did this workout yesterday because I was bored and yay I get to do it again! This is a very easy video but the burn is definitely there.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Straight Leg Pulse:</em> By far the easiest move. Cassey doesn&rsquo;t keep you going long enough for it to hurt.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant and Fire Hydrant Kick:</em> These definitely got tiresome especially when the kick was added but the burn felt amazing.</li>
<li><em>Sexy Dancer Kicks:</em> A very simple move. You really have to focus on tending your legs and moving slowly and deliberately to feel something.</li>
<li><em>Hot Potato:</em> Another easy move to do and to feel the burn. I struggled with the pacing a bit because I didn&rsquo;t want to tap on the floor too loud and wake my parents up.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-fat-destroyer">Video 2: Fat Destroyer</h3>

<p>My heart was really pumping for this video! At the risk of repeating myself, this is hard to do quietly.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Squat Tap:</em> I didn&rsquo;t do the jump associated with this but I did make sure to squat as low as possible.</li>
<li><em>Lunge to High Kick:</em> I lost my balance easily with this one, haha!</li>
<li><em>Plank Walk Opener:</em> A fun move that kind of slowed down the pace but not too much.</li>
<li><em>Plank Jack:</em> Had to substitute this one with a quieter version but even that was difficult.</li>
<li><em>Mountain Climber and Wide Mountain Climber:</em> The wide climber was LOUD but I managed to do the normal version well.</li>
<li><em>Pile Hops:</em> Another one I couldn&rsquo;t do with the jump, I just focused on squatting as low as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-upper-back-and-leg-stretches">Video 3: Upper Back and Leg Stretches</h3>

<p>Really great stretches for the legs, my problem area. It requires the usage of a belt or a long strap. You really get a stretch out of this one!</p>
