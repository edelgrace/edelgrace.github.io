<h3 id="day-23-abs">Day 23: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay I&rsquo;m pretty behind. It&rsquo;s now past midnight, I should be doing day 25 today. I&rsquo;m waking up early tomorrow so I&rsquo;ll have to skip out on catching up on day 24 until later in the day. Yesterday (two days ago?) I came home late with a huge head ache and immediately fell asleep. Like I came home, fell on my bed, and went to sleep! My headache was brutal.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>These are getting easier with every video! Except for those hundreds. I still can&rsquo;t do them without pausing. One day I will get there (I say that every time). The leg moves were a little bit tougher today (just by a smidgen) since I had my cycling class today.</p>

<h3 id="video-2-6-minutes-to-a-sexy-little-waist">Video 2: 6 Minutes to a Sexy Little Waist</h3>

<p>This video wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Rainbow Oblique:</em> A really interesting move. I felt like I over compensated with this move because I only felt it in my legs and not in my obliques. Also, Cassey looks so graceful doing this move but I&rsquo;m sure I looked like a mess doing it!</li>
<li><em>Windshield Wipers:</em> Another one that I felt I wasn&rsquo;t doing properly. But I did feel a burn, just not in the side. My legs totally felt this one.</li>
<li><em>Waist Whittlers:</em> I find these really hard! I could not do these with the modification. And it took a while to actually get it properly. These killed me!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-quick-ab-workout">Video 3: Quick Ab Workout</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Quick.&rdquo; It felt like eternity! I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of long repetitions, I really like it when there&rsquo;s variety in the moves. This video is essentially two move: double leg lift and criss cross. The double leg lift was hard and I could not do it without the beginner&rsquo;s modification. My back keeps wanting to arch and create that hollow. When I tried to flatten my back out, I definitely felt my abs. Which is what was supposed to happen! As for the criss cross, I could only do four without feeling pain already. I had to pause a couple of times but strangely, I found these easier to do.</p>
