<h3 id="video-1-far-burning-cardio-warmup">Video 1: Far Burning Cardio Warmup</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done this video so many times that I&rsquo;ve almost memorized everything Cassey said, haha! The moves in this video are easy and fun, as always.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Hot Potato:</em> This is a nice and easy move to start off the video. When I&rsquo;m rewatching the videos to write these posts, only then do I notice how graceful Cassey looks doing the moves&hellip; Goals.</li>
<li><em>Leg Circles:</em> These aren&rsquo;t hard but tiring. My legs get heavier and heavier with each circle. I had to like look at my legs and will them to go wider, haha!</li>
<li><em>Side Plank Leg Lifts:</em> I had to do the beginner&rsquo;s version of this video, unfortunately. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I didn&rsquo;t feel the burn!</li>
<li><em>Hip Twists:</em> This is probably the first time I did this move without stopping. I&rsquo;m not sure if I did them 100% correct but I tried my best to power through them and power through them I did!</li>
<li><em>Pointed Butt Pulses:</em> An easy move! My thigh (?) got a little bit tired though.</li>
<li><em>Knee Curlers:</em> This added some difficulty to the pulses in the previous move, which is fine. I liked doing this move even if I felt like I was flailing about.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-perfect-legs-workout">Video 3: Perfect Legs Workout</h3>

<p>I finished this video a little after midnight but I&rsquo;m not going to count it as being behind. This video was the harder one out of day 25 but it did feel good.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Half Clam Lifter:</em> I don&rsquo;t really know if I&rsquo;m doing this move right but it definitely hurt. I tried to keep an eye on my leg to see if I had proper form but the rest of my body felt a little bit weird.</li>
<li><em>Half Clam Pulse:</em> This hurt a little bit more but it was easier.</li>
<li><em>Lateral Leg Extension:</em> &ldquo;You feel it?&rdquo; I feel it&hellip; This definitely hurt to do since my legs were feeling tired.</li>
<li><em>Floor tap:</em> My foot lingered a little bit too long on the floor but I made it up with doing more on each leg. The stretch after this move was amazing.</li>
<li><em>Frogger:</em> I love froggers! It&rsquo;s easy but my legs definitely feel it.</li>
<li><em>Frogger Abs:</em> I really like this modification! It&rsquo;s an easy move to do, just like the frogger, but I love that burning feeling in my abs.</li>
<li><em>Heel Clicks:</em> This move is another easy one. Lowering the legs make it a little bit harder.</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross:</em> Another easy move. In another video, Cassey mentioned focusing on lifting the legs and not relying on momentum of the legs. This really added some much needed difficulty.</li>
<li><em>Leg Circles:</em> The tiny circles were killer! The larger circles made my hips click and while there was no pain, I got a little bit concerned with the feeling and the sound. I tried to push through it though!</li>
</ul>
