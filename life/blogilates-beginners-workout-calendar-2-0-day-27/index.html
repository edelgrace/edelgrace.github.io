<h3 id="day-27-total-body">Day 27: Total Body</h3>

<p>Today is the last day of the beginner&rsquo;s workout calendar, not including the rest day tomorrow! I think I&rsquo;ll make a blog post the day after rest day to talk about how the month went. As for today, today was a lot of sweat and groaning! A lot of cardio today, even if it isn&rsquo;t intensive.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-fat-burning-ladder-for-toned-thighs-and-abs">Video 1: Fat Burning Ladder for Toned Thighs and Abs</h3>

<p>There is a couple of basic moves done in 45, 30, and 20 second bursts. Thankfully, the moves are pretty doable. The only time I paused was when I had to position my laptop to see the screen properly between moves.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Froggy Hop:</em> I did the beginner&rsquo;s version of this move, solely because I didn&rsquo;t want to wake up my dad downstairs. This is the least intensive move in this video.</li>
<li><em>Push Up Plank:</em> I hate these so much!!! Halfway through, I had to switch from the advanced to beginner&rsquo;s version. Push ups are not my area of expertise.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Lunge:</em> I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because of yesterday&rsquo;s workout, but I felt actual pain doing these. I don&rsquo;t even remember what yesterday&rsquo;s workout was and if there were a lot of thighs involved&hellip;</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross Abs:</em> I&rsquo;m starting to love and hate this move. There is a lot of this move in today&rsquo;s workout.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-flat-belly-fat-burner">Video 2: Flat Belly Fat Burner</h3>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>In and Out:</em> I just did froggy hop beginner&rsquo;s version as to not wake up my dad, yet again.</li>
<li><em>Roll Ups:</em> This is my favourite move of all time. It&rsquo;s fun doing them fast. I still can&rsquo;t do them without lifting up my legs but my feet are little a little lower each time.</li>
<li><em>Surfers:</em> This is another move I had to modify to be quieter. I just kind of stepped on one leg and spun around fast.</li>
<li><em>Triple Crunch:</em> I really don&rsquo;t know how to do crunches without straining my neck. In fact, it just feels like I&rsquo;m straining my neck!</li>
<li><em>Burpees:</em> Yet another move I had to modify. I did the silent burpees plus a mini push up.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lifts:</em> I tried really hard to focus on my abs with this move. I definitely felt it.</li>
<li><em>Football Runs:</em> Good thing this move focuses on light feet because I really did not want to wake my dad up.</li>
<li><em>Eagle Abs:</em> how do I do these properly? I&rsquo;m doing them in a way that I really feel my abs but I&rsquo;m sure that if someone watched me and then watched Cassey, they would laugh at me, haha!</li>
<li><em>Criss Cross Abs:</em> There is around 2-3 minutes of this move&hellip; It&rsquo;s so hard to do for such a long time! Cassey does add some variation but of course, it&rsquo;s to challenge us and not to make it monotonous.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-6-minutes-to-a-sexy-booty">Video 3: 6 Minutes to a Sexy Booty</h3>

<p>Still debating whether or not I want a &ldquo;booty&rdquo; or not. I did the video anyway.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Cross Butt Lift:</em> This move is really interesting&hellip; I could feel the burn through the entire thing. I also did not do it properly because I just could not make my knee touch the floor.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> When I first tried this move, it was pretty easy but in this video, after those cross butt lifts, my butt was on fire! Ironic, considering the name of the move, haha.</li>
<li><em>Heel Lift:</em> Oh my legs! And more importantly, oh my butt&hellip; The pulses are torturous.</li>
</ul>
