<h3 id="day-3-total-body">Day 3: Total Body</h3>

<p>Today&rsquo;s workout starts off with 10 burpees. I will admit, I haven&rsquo;t done burpees since junior high school and I totally forgot how to do them. Unlike yesterday with the sit-ups, I didn&rsquo;t know how to do them at all. Like I had no notion of what a burpee was. So I had to look it up. Once I read the description, my junior high school gym classes suddenly came flooding back to me. I hated burpees back then and I still do now. In the end I opted for Fitness Blender&rsquo;s silent burpees because I&rsquo;m on the second floor and my parents were sleeping in the basement. Also it was almost midnight.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-bubble-butt-workout">Video 1: Bubble Butt Workout</h3>

<p>This video is around 9 minutes long and surprisingly only has three moves. There are a little more reps for each workout though, and that&rsquo;s for each leg.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Toe to ceiling pulse:</em> At first this started out easy but it got a little tiring near the end. I made it though!</li>
<li><em>Hammy curl:</em> This one I felt like I was on the verge of cramping up so I admit I did not clench as hard as I should have.</li>
<li><em>Grashopper:</em> I could not do these at all! It felt like I was doing them but my legs probably lifted maybe half a centimeter off the floor.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-total-body-workout-with-ana-caban">Video 2: Total Body Workout with Ana Caban</h3>

<p>In this video, Cassey brings on a guest Pilates instructor, Ana Caban. I&rsquo;m guessing Ana is big in the pilates world because Cassey was fangirling over her a bit. It was kind of cute to see! There isn&rsquo;t a big difference between Cassey and Ana other than Cassey is more talkative. Their moves are approximately around the same level.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll up:</em> I&rsquo;ve come to like roll ups a lot. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the only move I can do!</li>
<li><em>1 Legged Teaser Twist:</em> I just did these and I don&rsquo;t remember what they were&#8230; I had to rewatch the beginning of the video, haha. This move looks so graceful! I think this is one of the easier moves in this video.</li>
<li><em>Kneeling Side Series:</em> This is very similar to one of the moves from yesterday, I think (I don&rsquo;t remember which one exactly). It&rsquo;s not hard, it&rsquo;s just hard to resist giving up, haha! My legs tend to get tired easily doing moves like these.</li>
<li><em>Half Cobra Pushup:</em> Cassey herself said these were pretty simple but doing a lot of them in a row gets tough. Unfortunately, Casey doesn&rsquo;t exactly let it get to that point in the video.</li>
<li><em>Banana and Banana Teaser Twist:</em> It was really hard keeping my balance for these moves and because of that, I wasn&rsquo;t doing them properly. I felt zero tension in my body doing these.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> This one was actually an okay move! When it comes to the pilates stance, my neck tends to hurt a lot. It&rsquo;s most likely because I&rsquo;m not doing it right and lifting with my neck and not my abs but I&rsquo;m not sure how to do that exactly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>What I did differently today was watch the videos once or twice before actually starting the workout. I had to be somewhere really early in the morning and I didn&rsquo;t have time to do the workout then so I just downloaded the videos and watched them on my commute. When I got home later that evening, I made up the skeleton of this post, as I noted all the different exercises before hand. This was my second exposure to the workout. I splurged on food today so I didn&rsquo;t actually get to working out until late night since my stomach was so full for what felt like hours (I almost ate one pound of calories today, r.i.p. me).</p>

<p>This day I think was purposefully easier. Probably because Cassey (accurately) anticipated how sore my abs were from yesterday! It was a good boost in motivation.</p>

<p>The only downside is that I should not have had a glass of water literally minutes before starting this. My stomach felt full and uncomfortable throughout the whole thing but I wanted to get it done before midnight. Never again.</p>
