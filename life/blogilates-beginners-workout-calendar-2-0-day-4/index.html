<h3 id="day-4-lower-body">Day 4: Lower Body</h3>

<p>The little preamble for today in the calendar simply said to drink a glass of 8 oz of water. I have no idea what 8 oz looks like. Or how much any other measurements of liquids look like for that matter. So I just drank a regular glass of water.</p>

<p>I was definitely wondering why there was no simple warm up today and then I clicked to see the videos. There are <em>three</em> videos today. Oh. That&rsquo;s why!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-cardio-warm-up">Video 1: Cardio Warm Up</h3>

<p>This first video isn&rsquo;t exactly pilates but is something out of like a dance workout DVD. It&rsquo;s very high energy (it is cardio after all) and it totally got me sweating a little. There are no named moves in this workout, Cassey just speeds through them all, which is understandable.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-inner-thighs">Video 2: Inner Thighs</h3>

<p>This video is a bit of fun! Cassey lets a few of her fans come on screen for this session. On my first viewing of this video, I really inspected each of the fans in the background. It was a little bit relieving to see some more faces. There was this one girl who was absolutely adorable, she looked like she was struggling but she did it all with a smile on her face! She&rsquo;s laugh every single time she was straining, haha!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Frogger:</em> I feel like I&rsquo;ve gotten better at holding my legs in midair! I definitely felt this one though.</li>
<li><em>Froggy Heel Kicks:</em> At first it seems really simple but legs got tired fast!</li>
<li><em>Frogger Heel Touch:</em> A variant of frogger, obviously. It&rsquo;s harder so I prefer plain old vanilla frogger.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Side Raise:</em> This was hard! The position of the foot is a little weird and I slipped up a couple of times but when I didn&rsquo;t, I felt it.</li>
<li><em>Inner Thigh Lift:</em> Another hard move but not nearly as hard as the previous one. My legs tire easily apparently&hellip;</li>
<li><em>Pile Squat Pulses:</em> Squats make me nervous so I was not looking forward to this one. It actually wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought it would be!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-how-to-do-a-handstand">Video 3: How to do a Handstand</h3>

<p>I skipped this video as I&rsquo;m not really interested in doing a handstand. I&rsquo;m way too scared to try and attempt it! Maybe I should have done it but eh.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>I feel so accomplished, this was the first day where I didn&rsquo;t have to pause the video or take a couple seconds of rest during a move. I made it from start to finish! I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m getting used to it or if Cassey made this day deliberately easy like yesterday. I hope it&rsquo;s the former. I actually enjoy doing this when I can actually do it!</p>
