<h3 id="day-5-abs">Day 5: Abs</h3>

<p>Okay I switched up the preambles in the calendar because apparently I can&rsquo;t read. Day three I was supposed to plank for 30 seconds, yesterday I was supposed to do the burpees, and today I was supposed to drink an 8 oz of water. Whoops! So I compensated today by not only drinking the water but also doing the plank. I hate planks so much, they hurt! But no pain, no gain, I guess.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-total-body-workout">Video 1: Total Body Workout</h3>

<p>This video is the same video from the first day. Maybe it&rsquo;s meant as a confidence booster to show how much you&rsquo;ve progressed over the last five days.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Pilates stance:</em> I&rsquo;ll admit, I still struggle with this but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt as much and I can feel my abs working more.</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> I love roll ups even though I can&rsquo;t 100% do them. I did ONE proper roll up without trying to support myself and it made so happy!.</li>
<li><em>Leg stuff:</em> This time around I did more of this without having to rest. Those pyramids are still tough but I can at least make it until that point without resting for a bit.</li>
<li><em>Cobra position:</em> My arms still hate these.</li>
<li><em>Elbow push ups:</em> Less sucky compared to last time but still sucky.</li>
<li><em>Mermaid stretches:</em> This move is so pretty and really easy! Nothing much has changed since the first time I did them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-2-abs-and-butt-workout">Video 2: Abs and Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I love how Cassey keeps bringing on guests onto her videos so we don&rsquo;t get tired of her, haha. The guest this time is Rosanna from the YouTube channel Nerd Nummies. Makes sense, a chef should probably try their best to stay healthy. Ro is SO cute.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Scissors:</em> These were a pretty easy way to start off a workout, thank goodness! It definitely got my heart pumping.</li>
<li><em>One Leg Crunch:</em> Like Ro, I definitely had to do the easier variant of this move. Crunches/sit ups are so hard for me. I feel like I&rsquo;m continuously using my neck instead of my abs. How do I used my abs??</li>
<li><em>Roll ups:</em> Thank goodness for roll ups.</li>
<li><em>Balancing Pilates Stances:</em> Also like Ro, I totally struggled with this one. My sense of balance is really off.</li>
<li><em>Fire Hydrant:</em> This one got me tired really fast. My legs were on fire! But it&rsquo;s all for the butt so I guess it&rsquo;s okay.</li>
<li><em>Plank Twists:</em> Oh gosh this was hard for me! I kept collapsing to the floor. Planks are not my strong point. I&rsquo;ll probably have to work on that.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>My heart definitely got pumping in this workout! I was slightly disappointed how I wasn&rsquo;t able to do all of the first video flawlessly but I did feel some improvement. One day, I will get there. I really enjoyed Ro&rsquo;s prescence in the second video because it was a reminder that not everyone can get the moves right away 100% of the time. Sometimes I forget there are normal people like me doing these videos. I think today was really fun and I can&rsquo;t wait for tomorrow!</p>
