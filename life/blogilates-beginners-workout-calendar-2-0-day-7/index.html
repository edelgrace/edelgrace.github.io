<h3 id="day-7-rest-day">Day 7: Rest Day</h3>

<p>Thank goodness for the rest day. Technically there is 30 minutes left of day 7 and I feel like I should be doing something. So I&rsquo;m searching for some quick videos to do before midnight hits. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve done a week of this already! Here&rsquo;s to four more weeks!</p>

<h3 id="video-1-two-ingredient-banana-pancakes">Video 1: Two Ingredient Banana Pancakes</h3>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t try these mostly because I had ate all of my calories by the time I got to doing the calendar. I&rsquo;ve heard many mixed reviews about these &ldquo;pancakes.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re simply just eggs and banana fried together. It sounds really weird and I&rsquo;m doubting whether or not they actually taste good. I&rsquo;m a horrible cook but I would like to try them one day.</p>

<h3 id="video-2-quiet-cardio-workout-fitnessblender">Video 2: Quiet Cardio Workout (FitnessBlender)</h3>

<p>Okay, today I cheated. Today is a &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; after all! I didn&rsquo;t feel good about not doing any workouts today. I had to do something, at least. It&rsquo;s nearly midnight now and I decided to do a quiet workout since most of the house is asleep. There are 10 exercises in this workout, repeated twice for a total of around 20 minutes.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>4 Torso Twists &amp; 2 Kicks:</em> This is an easy move but it got my heart pumping right away!</li>
<li><em>X Squats:</em> I hate X squats so much! They&rsquo;re not hard but really tiring. I was breathing pretty heavily at this point.</li>
<li><em>Deadlift Jacks:</em> I actually like this one except I didn&rsquo;t have enough room to do them in my office (AKA my study room). I tried my best though, and ended up making weird angles.</li>
<li><em>Up &amp; Over Steps and Knees:</em> This is another easy one but kind of difficult to do it quietly! I like how these workouts emphasize how quiet you&rsquo;re trying to be.</li>
<li><em>Slow Squats &amp; Hooks:</em> Okay, I hate these too! Do you see a trend here? Squats and planks are not my friends. It kinda feel fun to be punching the air though&hellip;</li>
<li><em>Quiet Burpees:</em> I did these earlier in the week when one of the days required burpees. It was kind of cheating but I really needed to be quiet that day because I usually exercise at night when everyone is sleeping/falling asleep.</li>
<li><em>Arm &amp; Leg Balance Swings:</em> This is an easy exercise. I just have no balance sometimes. I really tried to focus on contracting my arms and legs but I keep forgetting about my core.</li>
<li><em>3 Twists &amp; Knee Ups:</em> I always get confused with the rhythm of this move and I get behind compared to the person on the screen. I think I&rsquo;m tempted to do four twists instead of three.</li>
<li><em>Plank Tucks &amp; Extensions:</em> Planks!!!! My number one enemy. Admittedly, these are the easiest variation of planks that I&rsquo;ve done this week. I really hate planks. Maybe one day I can do them without complaining&hellip;</li>
<li><em>Low Lateral Steps:</em> This &ldquo;completely depends on how quiet you are.&rdquo; Seriously. Go too fast and you make a lot of noise whenever you put your feet to the ground. I always feel myself gaining momentum. At least the workout ends on an easy note.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Rest day.&rdquo; I think every rest day I will still exercise for maybe ten to twenty minutes with someone other than Cassey. Maybe next week I&rsquo;ll actually try her recipes because I&rsquo;ve been so hungry lately!</p>

<p>With the cardio workout, I felt like I sweat buckets. It was almost as if I sweat more in this twenty minutes than the entire week! To be fair, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of cardio in Cassey&rsquo;s workouts. They mostly focus on strength and toning. I&rsquo;d like to include more cardio into my week. I already have a spin class every week which is just once a week for 50 minutes. Cassey does sometimes include some cardio but I feel like it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>

<p>Also, they say that workouts should make you feel awake but as soon as the workout was over, I became instantly tired. Time to hit the hay I guess. I also probably need to eat more whenever I do cardio&hellip;</p>
