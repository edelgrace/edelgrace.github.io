<h3 id="day-8-total-body">Day 8: Total Body</h3>

<p>After my &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been missing Cassey a little. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s already the second week! It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s been that long&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="video-1-indoor-cardio-workout">Video 1: Indoor Cardio Workout</h3>

<p>I wish I had more time to do workouts in the morning because when it comes to the cardio videos, I just can&rsquo;t do them 100% without making a bunch of noise. I workout at night which is the most convenient time for me. I did get my heart rate up though, even if I didn&rsquo;t do the workout to my fullest.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<h3 id="video-2-body-slimming-workout">Video 2: Body Slimming Workout</h3>

<p>This &ldquo;body slimming&rdquo; workout is essentially a rehash of the beginner&rsquo;s pilate video Cassey made. I enjoy the better quality a lot!</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Roll Ups:</em> I&rsquo;m slowly working my way up from an assisted to non-assisted roll up! I can do a couple of roll ups now without holding onto my legs, however my feet kind of lift off the ground but it&rsquo;s progress!</li>
<li><em>Pilates Stance:</em> This move is okay, I&rsquo;m finding it easier to hold myself up but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m holding myself up high enough.</li>
<li><em>The Hundred:</em> These still are pretty hard for me but when Cassey turned from table top to straight let, I was surprised at how it didn&rsquo;t get much harder. I can feel myself do these better and without as much strain in my neck!</li>
<li><em>Bridge Pulses:</em> This is a new move! At first it felt really easy to do but then I started to really feel it in my butt. Now, whenever Cassey says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll feel it in your butt,&rdquo; I never do so this is a first for me.</li>
<li><em>Double Leg Lift:</em> I still don&rsquo;t know how to position my hands so that my tailbone doesn&rsquo;t hurt&hellip;</li>
<li><em>Half Cobra Pushup:</em> The cobra moves are a little bit more easier to do every time.</li>
<li><em>Parachuter:</em> Another new move! This move is cool but I have no idea if I&rsquo;m doing it right. I feels like I&rsquo;m lifting my body up but again, is it high enough? I don&rsquo;t know.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-3-stretches-to-relieve-lower-back-pain">Video 3: Stretches to Relieve Lower Back Pain</h3>

<p>I tend to slouch a lot but lately I&rsquo;m becoming more conscious of my posture. My back surprisingly hurts more than usual so I was hoping these would help me in some way.</p>

<div class="flex-video">
</div>

<ul>
<li><em>Seated Twist:</em> These felt really good! I do a variation of this whenever I&rsquo;m sitting down.</li>
<li><em>Pretzel:</em> Cassey claims that this move was a typical gym class move but I&rsquo;m not sure I remember it! I didn&rsquo;t feel this one as much but it was surprising to me to find out that I&rsquo;m more flexible on my right compared to my left side.</li>
<li><em>Cobra:</em> I just can&rsquo;t seem to escape the cobras&hellip; Maybe that&rsquo;s a good thing because it&rsquo;s the thing that I need to work on the most!</li>
<li><em>Scorpion Twist:</em> Hmmm, I don&rsquo;t really see the correlation with a scorpion but this was a fun move regardless. I didn&rsquo;t have much room to do these but it was still a good stretch.</li>
<li><em>Cat-Dog:</em> This reminds me of like otso-otso in slow motion. Below my shoulders it kind of started to hurt. I didn&rsquo;t feel much of a stretch but I really tried to mimic the ost-otso flow, haha!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>First day of week 2 is over! Today was a little slow with the recap and just a couple of new moves. The cardio wasn&rsquo;t as heart pumping as I wanted it to be, solely my fault. I&rsquo;m a little skeptical of the stretches videos because they seem so &ldquo;complimentary&rdquo; to the cardio and workout video but it&rsquo;s a good way to wind down!</p>
