<h3 id="day-10-abs">Day 10: Abs</h3>

<p>The day starts off with two thirty second planks on each side. How I hate planks&hellip; But I did it anyway, even if I cheated for a couple seconds on each. There&rsquo;s only one new video today and I decided that I wouldn&rsquo;t list all the moves for the other videos again in the interest of time and because I don&rsquo;t really have anything to say about specific moves.</p>

<h3 id="video-1-ab-time">Video 1: Ab Time</h3>

<p>This video is so simple and without graphics, it&rsquo;s so weird now that I&rsquo;m used to her more recent videos! The moves are considerably easier this time around. I was able to do the plank and plank variations which made me pretty happy!</p>

<h3 id="video-2-bubble-butt-workout">Video 2: Bubble Butt Workout</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little skeptical on the whole butt thing (is lifting my butt a good thing even if I have absolutely no butt?) but I did this workout anyway. I was able to go through this entire video without cheating. The grasshopper move at the end is still pretty hard for me. I&rsquo;m getting bonier and my hips hurt being pushed to the ground&hellip; Otherwise, I think my butt is on it&rsquo;s way to become a butt!</p>

<h3 id="video-3-best-stretches-for-chilling-out">Video 3: Best Stretches for Chilling Out</h3>

<p>These stretches feel so good afterwards! Early in the day I got a Charliehorse in one leg and almost in the other so I didn&rsquo;t push myself as much as I could have. I just hate cramping up. Obviously I need to do more stretches and drink more water.</p>

<p>Today was an overall good day! In the morning I went to my spin class. We had a different instructor today and he worked us HARD. But the things he did were so fun and really did include some familiar pilates moves. A lot of working out in my core. However, the post stretch workout gave me a Charlie horse in my right leg and it was pretty sore until the evening. I also spent a good amount of the day walking around as I walked to the clinic to see a doctor (nothing serious, don&rsquo;t worry).</p>

<p>The Blogilates workouts today was definitely a feel good motivator. It&rsquo;s great seeing some sort of progress. Maybe that means tomorrow will be especially hard! I&rsquo;m expecting to receive the March calendar soon so maybe I&rsquo;ll do them in parallel and see if that ramps up the difficulty. It makes me a little nervous knowing how the workouts can get harder. Some of the days seem so hard already! Well, I guess I just gotta push through.</p>
