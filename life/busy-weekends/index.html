      <h1>Busy Weekends</h1>
      
      <p>I have a whole load of things to do this weekend. Not sure if I&rsquo;ll actually get around to doing those said things. But at least my midterms are finally over! But finals start up in two weeks. Huh. Now that I&rsquo;ve made a list of things I need to, it doesn&rsquo;t really seem like that much but considering my procrastination habits, it is quite a lot. Weekends are for relaxing, not for drowning myself in tears. Funny how my calculus teacher in high school once said that his roommates in university only did homework on Sunday afternoons. 12 hours is not enough to do homework anymore. And I definitely started typing &ldquo;homestuck&rdquo; instead of homework, Hussie what are you doing to me? So yeah, here&rsquo;s my list of things to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computers post-lab</li>
<li>Computers pre-lab</li>
<li>Computers in-lab</li>
<li>Behaviour of liquids, solids, and gases lab</li>
<li>Calculus homework</li>
<li>Linear algebra homework</li>
<li>Start studying for finals</li>
<li>Work on video game project for design</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a list of things I want to do. Sadly, only one of those things are present on my things I need to do list. It looks like I got my work cut out for me, yeah?</p>

<ul>
<li>Read lots and lots of Homestuck</li>
<li>Work on video game project for design</li>
<li>Replay some Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 (I actually want to read pay more attention to what&rsquo;s happening at least try to)</li>
<li>Write a review/reaction/long ass rant about Assassin&rsquo;s Creed 3 (I have a lot of feelings about this franchise)</li>
<li>Work on my database of books</li>
<li>Work on other things that require coding of the HTML considering I haven&rsquo;t done that in a while</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a list of what I&rsquo;m doing right now. Gosh darn it, I&rsquo;m so productive.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>Neopets</li>
<li>Reading Homestuck</li>
<li>Thinking of starting my behaviour of liquids, solids, and gases lab</li>
</ul>

<p>I spend too much on Tumblr, it&rsquo;s so addicting. I used to scoff at the idea of micro-blogging but now every time I want to make a really long wall of text, I go straight to Tumblr instead of here. It kinda makes me sad. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s more accessible for my friends. But why do I even want my friends to know about the stuff I do? I think it&rsquo;s some weird social media thing. Like how on Facebook you make your life seem more interesting than it really is. That&rsquo;s kinda like what I used Tumblr for. Tumblr is like a giant mess of my thoughts. If you want to know what I&rsquo;m currently obsessing about, Tumblr is the place to look. It&rsquo;s just really good cathartic way of expressing myself. Social media, why must you do this to me?</p>
