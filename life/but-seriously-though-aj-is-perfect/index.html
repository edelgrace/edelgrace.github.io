      <h1>But Seriously Though. AJ is perfect.</h1>
      
      <p>AJ reminds me of Kemal. As much as I&rsquo;d hate to say it, that&rsquo;s the number one reason why I find AJ so attractive. He&rsquo;s like the Korean version of Kemal. Also, I&rsquo;d rather fangirl over AJ than be madly crushing on a guy who probably thinks I&rsquo;m an idiot and who I haven&rsquo;t seen in almost a year.</p>

<p>However, I saw Kemal on campus a while ago and I realized how much they don&rsquo;t really look like each other. Just the overall idea of their faces are similar. I think Kemal is more handsome while AJ is more pretty boy cute. They both have beautifully cheekbones though. :( I&rsquo;m a sucker for nice cheekbones&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably my memory being rusty but I feel like they have similar accents too. Kemal&rsquo;s accent is more Russian and thicker. But they sound very similar! When I watch their lips, they both make the same movements when they speak. It&rsquo;s freaky. I need to hang out with Kemal again to really get a good comparison of the two.</p>

<p>But seriously though. AJ is perfect.</p>
