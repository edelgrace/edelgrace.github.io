      <h1>Conversations Over Text Messages</h1>
      
      <p>Long weird sappy feelings. So much sap and cheese and this sounded better in my head because I kinda read it in a certain way. Man, I just don’t know. Also, for the love of gulay, the end of a line does not mean &ldquo;pause.&rdquo; Punctuation means &ldquo;pause.&rdquo; Yes, you’re supposed to run out of breath (I&rsquo;m kinda slightly asthmatic though, so).</p>

<p>i’m sorry,</p>

<p>but i won’t ever text you again</p>

<p>and i hope you never text me again either.</p>

<p>usually i love communication that doesn’t involve me</p>

<p>actually speaking but with you, it’s different.</p>

<p>there’s a disconnect.</p>

<p>a disconnect between you and your words, your words</p>

<p>that appear in the form of pixels</p>

<p>and not in the form of your voice</p>

<p>it just doesn’t feel like you.</p>

<p>it feels strange and foreign</p>

<p>it’s like a translator sucked away your personality</p>

<p>and in their place put in words that barely make sense</p>

<p>even though when i’m speaking to you</p>

<p>your accent is thick and heavy and</p>

<p>your words still don’t really</p>

<p>make sense to me but at least it’s you.</p>

<p>and one of my favourite things about you</p>

<p>is the way you talk.</p>

<p>you talk with your face.</p>

<p>your lips mischievously curl upwards and</p>

<p>they push out at certain syllables and</p>

<p>in moments of confusion your brows furrow and</p>

<p>your lips purse and</p>

<p>when you’re not talking, you look at me so intently</p>

<p>and so full of purpose like</p>

<p>“i’m listening to you and by god i will listen to you.”</p>

<p>even though i’m sure you’re just</p>

<p>being polite and don’t actually think that but i guess</p>

<p>you’re just that convincing.</p>

<p>and it’s weird because my anxiety is worse</p>

<p>when i’m texting you, even when just</p>

<p>the thought of talking to people face to face</p>

<p>shakes me so bad to the point where i feel like</p>

<p>i don’t want to live anymore, or</p>

<p>i don’t deserve to live anymore, or</p>

<p>i don’t even have the ability to live normally anymore.</p>

<p>and even though i feel that way before talking to you,</p>

<p>it disappears as soon as i say “hi”</p>

<p>and with others it lasts until they’re out of the room</p>

<p>and i’m in at bed at night where i pick</p>

<p>apart my words and use them to pick apart my mind</p>

<p>and i wish i knew why.</p>

<p>but i guess the point is,</p>

<p>i’m sorry.</p>

<p>but let’s never text again.</p>
