      <h1>Day 1 of Summer School</h1>
      
      <p>Yesterday I started summer school. I said before that I had to take Religion 35 because it&rsquo;s required to graduate and I have no room in my schedule for it next year. So, yesterday I woke up at 6:30 AM sharp, ate my breakfast, changed, and dashed out the door. Usually the first day of school isn&rsquo;t intimidating but for some reason, the first day of summer school was extremely nerve wrecking. Students from all highschools in my city go to my school for summer school. A lot of my friends are in marching band and are currently in the US right now so I barely know anyone there.</p>

<p>A lot of the kids used the main entrance to go into the school and I was the only one (that I saw) who used the side doors to get in. I got a couple of weird looks as I did but I shrugged it off. I guess there&rsquo;s not a lot of kids who go to my school who are going to summer school. So, I make my way to the foyer and the teachers are rounding up everyone into the gym. I walk in and see the bleachers filled with kids and I have no idea where to sit. Once I reached the end of the gym, I turned around to see someone I knew. Ah, I was filled with relief when I saw her. So we sat down, talked about our short 2 week break, what we&rsquo;re taking, etc.</p>

<p>Then the principal of summer school came and talked about rules, expectations, etc. Then he started to call out the classes by name. I hear Religion 15, and Religion 25 but not Religion 35. Maybe my hearing&rsquo;s going, but I swear I did not hear him say Religion 35. I tag along with this kid who I know is in my Religion 35 class and follow him to our class. We were a little bit late but it was the first day so it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>My teacher (I&rsquo;ll call him Mr. W) is extremely nice. He has a dry sense of humour (it&rsquo;s so dry that it&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious) and can actually teach. My past religion teachers have been nothing but weird experiences. One was so creepy that all of his students (I mean <strong>all</strong> of his students) think he&rsquo;s a pedophile, another made us watch movies all the time (not to say that I don&rsquo;t like movies, but I didn&rsquo;t learn a thing!), and the other one liked to talk about sex even though we weren&rsquo;t doing the family life unit. Yeah, I kinda prefer Mr. W over all of them.</p>

<p>So the day ended with a couple of questions for homework and a part 1 of a project to finish. Currently I am finishing up part 2 of said project. Actually, I&rsquo;m procrastinating but I say I did a lot so I&rsquo;m &ldquo;taking a break&rdquo;.</p>

<p>To get my mind off of school, I came across an amazing song. I&rsquo;m a Tumblr addict and I got my friend to intervene for me. Tumblr is my number one spot for finding out news about my favourite band, DIR EN GREY, as a lot of the people I follow are fellow Diru (as I affectionately call the band) fans. Recently they released a single and I totally did not know. It was a while ago as well, and I was deeply disappointed in myself. Their new song is called DIFFERENT SENSE. I absolutely love it. I can&rsquo;t put their music in any genre because they are so diverse. I&rsquo;d say it would be some type of metal. Metal core? Progressive? Sludge metal? I don&rsquo;t even know. All I know is that DIR EN GREY&rsquo;s music is amazing.</p>
