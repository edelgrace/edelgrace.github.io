      <h1>Day One of University</h1>
      
      <p>Today was my first day of orientation week! While it was fun, I found that it was lacking a bit somehow. I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to see how it&rsquo;ll pan out for the rest of the week. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be better than today.</p>

<p>It was hectic. I left the house at 7:24 got on the train around 7:40 and got there around 8:20. I was early but apparently too early. No one was there. Like hardly anyone! I wandered over to the engineering building after being semi-lost and thankfully (after a few minutes) orientation leaders began to show up.</p>

<p>Deanne (a girl who posted on the group page a lot) and I were the first ones from our group there. Our leader came soon-ish though. His name Hasheem or something but he said we could just call him &ldquo;H.&rdquo; Dylan quickly came soon after.</p>

<p>After the majority of our group showed up, we learned our engineering chant for the pep rally, we&rsquo;re given orange shirts (orange for engineers apparently), did some ice breaker games, and went off to the Oval. Lots of people. Lots. Of. People. Arts has a ton of people in it, I was surprised. Poor Kinesiology though. Maybe less than ten rows of them.</p>

<p>The rally involved lots of screaming but engineers are seriously lacking the spirit LIKE COME ON!</p>

<p>The whole pep rally was pretty cool though.</p>
