      <h1>Do You Remember the 21st night of September?</h1>
      
      <p>I love the song September by Earth Wind and Fire, so I just couldn&rsquo;t help myself. On the 21st I sang the song throughout the whole day. I was tempted to go and play the song on my flute because I learned it, but I forgot where the music for the song went. Oh well. So, do you guys remember what happened on the 21st night of September?</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been contemplating this for a while. I really don&rsquo;t want some of my blog entries read by some of the people I know in real life as some of my friends know about my various sites, including this one. I keep a lot of private entries because of this. I actually post regularly, but they&rsquo;re all private. So I&rsquo;m thinking of making password protected entries. If you guys want a password to my entries, feel free to comment in this entry.</p>

<p>So what has been happening lately? School. Nothing new actually. I&rsquo;m trying to do as well as I can so that means that I have less of a social life but I never really had one anyway so that&rsquo;s a-okay!</p>

<p>I love all my classes. Except for my physics class. Most of my physics class includes grade elevens. A whole lot of them are immature. They&rsquo;re all loud and they take advantage of our really frail and old teacher. Our teacher isn&rsquo;t that great either. I don&rsquo;t really understand anything he says and when I ask him a question he just gets mad at me. Ack. I think our class just puts him in a bad mood. It puts me in a bad mood too. I kinda wish my teacher would yell at them or something. However, I don&rsquo;t think that would change anything anyway.</p>

<p>Well, I have to go as it&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s birthday today. Please wish him many birthdays to come. :]</p>
