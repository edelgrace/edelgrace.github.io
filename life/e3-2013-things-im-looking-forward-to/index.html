      <h1>E3 2013: Things I’m Looking Forward To</h1>
      
      

<p>While I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a huge gamer, I game enough to be excited about E3 that&rsquo;s starting tomorrow. There is a ton of stuff that are coming out that will hopefully be super crazy due to the next gen consoles that are coming this year. So, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eyes glued to the screen on over the next few days.</p>

<h3 id="ps4-console">PS4 Console</h3>

<p>They showed us the controller, they showed us the features, and they showed us the games. They haven&rsquo;t showed us the actual console. Contrary to the Xbox One reveal, the reveal for the PS4 was basically advertising for games. While I do think that not showing the console may give them some leverage over Microsoft in that they might be able to make some last minute tweaks, it&rsquo;s probably not significant if they showed it before or after the Xbox One. Still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I&rsquo;m super excited to see it!</p>

<h3 id="used-game-rental-and-trading-policies">Used Game, Rental, and Trading Policies</h3>

<p>Used games are awesome. When my cousin gives me games he thought he&rsquo;d like but didn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s even better. Mostly because overpriced games hurt my wallet. And because my family is always super late to an next gen consoles. For example, we bought a PS3 <strong>just last year</strong>. It&rsquo;ll be a couple of years until we get the PS4 and I&rsquo;m hoping a lot of used games will be available for us (the cheaper they are, the better).</p>

<h3 id="watch-dogs">WATCH_DOGS</h3>

<p>I hate to say that I love Ubisoft, but I love Ubisoft. Despite their endless pitfalls, they make games that I like. Watching the WATCH_DOGS segment at the PS4 reveal was mind blowing. I was hooked at the very second it started. I&rsquo;m a sucker for conspiracy theories, especial the &ldquo;one company that controls about 90% of the world but no one really knows it&rdquo; kind of conspiracies. The game itself looks awesome. It&rsquo;s reminiscent of Assassin&rsquo;s Creed and my fingers are crossed that maybe it might take place on the Assassin&rsquo;s Creed universe (which is not likely, since I&rsquo;m pretty sure UbiGabe shot that idea down).</p>

<h3 id="destiny">Destiny</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never gotten into Halo and probably never will but with this new IP, I might finally get a taste of the next and possibly biggest series to date. But before that happens, I need to see what it&rsquo;s all about and if it&rsquo;ll be a series at all.</p>

<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>

<p>Cinematic trailers and speeches are all fine and dandy but gameplay is where it&rsquo;s at. Gameplay is the deal breaker. It comes before everything else. I personally haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of gameplay from any of the upcoming games so I look forward to it!</p>
