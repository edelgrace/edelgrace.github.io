      <h1>First Post of the New Year!</h1>
      
      <p>Most people&rsquo;s first post of the year is on the first, but no, I&rsquo;m unique and I&rsquo;ll have mine six days later. I&rsquo;ve been busy studying and working on <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">Room 304</a>. I&rsquo;m actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&rsquo;t study at all and now I&rsquo;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had quite a fun day. Firstly, went to Wal-Mart and bought <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> for our shiny new PS3 that we got over Christmas. Actually, I made the choice to buy it and not my brother. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to play that game ever since I had the demo on my iPod. Needless to say, when I got home I was glued to the TV screen and the controller for the rest of the day.</p>

</div>

<p>After that, we went to the library. I love the library. I could spend all day in there if the family weren&rsquo;t rushing every single time we go. I got four books and a CD.</p>

</div>

<p>I nearly flipped out when I looked at the CD. <em>DIR EN GREY &#8211; DUM SPIRO SPERO</em>. Okay, if you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m a <strong>huge</strong> DIR EN GREY fan. They&rsquo;re a Japanese band so buying their music is really expensive (shipping costs, the horror) so I rarely buy anything of theirs. I&rsquo;ve been waiting to listen to this album for the longest time and I refused to download it anywhere. Now I can listen to it without feeling that guilty, because it&rsquo;s from the library. I&rsquo;m still going to buy it eventually though.</p>

<p>The thing about the library is that it&rsquo;s right next to the mall. Where did we go next? The mall. I don&rsquo;t like shopping for clothes but I need clothes so I had to buy clothes. That part was boring.</p>

<p>Like I said before, we got home and I spent the rest of the day playing <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em>. It&rsquo;s such a good game&hellip; I want the other Assassin&rsquo;s Creed games. Expect they&rsquo;re so expensive! Another time I guess.</p>
