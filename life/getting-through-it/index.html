      <h1>Getting Through It</h1>
      
      

<p>Christmas break is here and so is a new layout. It&rsquo;s not my own, but I was just enamored by it&rsquo;s simplicity. Enjoy! Whew, I finally made it through my very first semester in university. I must say, it was quite a ride. I&rsquo;m glad I got through it. Finals are behind me and now I can just relax. Even though I do want to take this time to chill out and slow down the pace, I also want to be productive. I know, I know. What is there to be productive for? School&rsquo;s done for the semester! I&rsquo;ve actually got a couple of things that I want to accomplish during the break. In fact, I&rsquo;ve actually done a couple of those things already.</p>

<h2 id="get-my-id">Get my ID</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have an ID yet, mainly because I haven&rsquo;t bothered getting my drivers permit. I&rsquo;m really far behind on that, maybe this summer I&rsquo;ll get it (I say that all summer, every summer). Not having an ID is quite concerning, considering that I&rsquo;ll be 18 before the year ends. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a clubbing or party person, but I don&rsquo;t want to be caught in a situation where I need an ID and I don&rsquo;t have it. Plus, I&rsquo;m pretty sure there has to be some law out there saying that I need to have one on my person at all times.</p>

<h2 id="renew-my-library-card">Renew my library card</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m definitely getting my library card renewed! After I get my ID, that is. Once I&rsquo;m legally an adult, I need photo ID to renew my library card. I can no longer rely on my parents to provide that information for me (sad face). Going along with the theme of libraries, I want to work at the library. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be at a public library but any library would be good. I wish I had pushed harder for working at a university library when there was an opening there. My parents didn&rsquo;t want me working during university but now I&rsquo;m going to try a bit harder to convince them otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="clean-out-all-of-my-e-mail-inboxes">Clean out all of my e-mail inboxes</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how or why I accumulate as much e-mail as I do. I have around five e-mail accounts, not including all of my admin@domain.com e-mails. Prior to deleting all the unimportant e-mails, each of my accounts had around 1,000 to 2,000 (unread) e-mails, not including the ones that I <strong>have</strong> read. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy. Plus there&rsquo;s all the folders that I had to go through to weed out things that are out of date, and such. Call me crazy or not, but I actually did this all of yesterday. Thank goodness for the &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; and &ldquo;filter&rdquo; functions in Hotmail and Gmail. Who knew that I had 300+ e-mails from Tumblr telling me &ldquo;x&rdquo; person followed me, liked this, reblogged that, asked this, and replied to that?</p>

<h2 id="forwarding-all-of-my-e-mail-to-one-account">Forwarding all of my e-mail to one account</h2>

<p>Having more than five accounts across multiple domains is tough to keep track out. I migrated all of my e-mails to one account on Gmail. Gmail&rsquo;s filters is awesome for sorting mail into different labels so I can know which e-mail came from where. Plus, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to forward mail too! The only thing I have to do left is to forward all of my university mail, but for some reason it isn&rsquo;t working. I&rsquo;ll have to work on that later.</p>

<h2 id="catch-up-at-least-a-little-bit-with-my-book-log">Catch up (at least a little bit) with my book log</h2>

<p>To those who don&rsquo;t know, I have a <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">book log</a>. I&rsquo;m seriously so far behind with it! On <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> I have just over 1,200 books on my profile. I have 52 books logged in my book log. If this was Tumblr, I&rsquo;d insert an obligatory *shrieks and flies into the sun* somewhere into this paragraph. I&rsquo;m hoping to at least get a hundred books into the database before the Christmas break is over.</p>

<h2 id="website-clean-up">Website clean up</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like taking out some time to do some website clean up. I have so many websites, and I really need to consolidate everything because quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t have time for all of them (not that I did in the first place, haha). I&rsquo;ve narrowed it down to two websites and two other websites that require very little maintenance. Right now I have around around eight or nine. Yeah, some of those got to go!</p>

<h2 id="hush-hush-project">Hush hush project</h2>

<p>One of the four websites that I&rsquo;m keeping will actually be a new website. That means I&rsquo;m letting go of five or six of my current websites. I don&rsquo;t want to say too much about the website now, but I can guarantee that it will be up on New Years!</p>
