      <h1>Everything At Once</h1>
      
      <p>We have a new affiliate, <a href="http://www.himitsu-sasshi.net/">Sute/Himitsu-Sasshi</a>. I adore her website! I&rsquo;m so glad she is an affiliate ^^</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m making a new layout! Whoot! It features BGHS Marching Band. Oh of course. Haha. It&rsquo;s so colourful, I love it! I&rsquo;m also putting band quotes in the background. Yay!</p>

<p>What else, what else? I have Hallelujah in my head. We have to learn a whole new song by next week for soe District anniversay. I can already play 80% of the song! It&rsquo;s actually pretty easy.</p>

<p>Oh yes, GREY CUP WEEK! It was so much fun. Here&rsquo;s a quick summary.</p>

<p>Tuesday: Greeted the Rough Riders at the airport. It was pretty cool. The football players were taping/taking pictures of us on their cell phones. I saw myself on TV for like 2 seconds afterwards.</p>

<p>Wednesday: Played outside city hall. Watched the Grey Cup on horses. Haha. We got a group picture with the mayor! It was pretty epic. But my fingers were freezing XP</p>

<p>Thursday: Rough day. Saw the guy I like with a girl who also liked him. Kinda pissed me off. So we went to the Grey Cup player awards. We got to stay in this cool VIP area with a DJ! And then we got to play but a group of people were looking for their seats, standing right in front of us!</p>

<p>Friday: We went to Stephen Ave and did some stand and blows. We went to the street on our break and got free Pepsi and walked around in our uniforms.</p>

<p>Saturday: Grey cup parade! Yes! FREE BACON! And.. ELISHA CUTHBERT led the parade! I didn&rsquo;t even know she was there! Like, really? Weird. Some of my friends posed with her right before the parade!</p>

<p>I guess that&rsquo;s it for now. I wrote alot today ^^&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bye for now!</p>
