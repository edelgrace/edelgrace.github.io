      <h1>Good Riddance</h1>
      
      <p>Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&rsquo;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong. I&rsquo;m hoping for the best. But I&rsquo;m still worried! My stomach hurts just thinking about it! Thankfully I don&rsquo;t have to go to school until Tuesday. Even then, it seems like not a long time.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I wrote my chemistry, I went to the library and stayed there for a good hour. I took out eight books. <em>Moon Boy (Volumes 1-3)</em> by Lee Young-You, <em>Cirque Du Freak (Volume 7)</em> by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai, <em>Perfect Match</em> by Jodi Picoult, <em>Poster Boy</em> by Dede Crane, <em>The Truth About Delilah Blue</em> by Tish Cohen, and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami. You can read more about why I got those books <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/at-the-library-1/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Later on in the evening, I went to a youth group meeting at my parish. It was my first time there (and the first youth group meeting in a year) but I knew everyone there so I didn&rsquo;t really have to worry about social interactions and such. There was a lot of discussion going on, which was quite enjoyable I think. I&rsquo;m not much of a talker so I just listened. I left with a lot to think about, actually. The theme of that meeting was basically being aware of what&rsquo;s happening in the world. Of course, being young adults, we got off topic quite a couple of times but each topic was just as meaningful as the first. I&rsquo;m hoping to go regularly if time permits.</p>

<p>So, a couple days ago I finally transferred my domains from Go Daddy to Namecheap. Why? Because of the constant complaints I always hear about them, the poor customer service, and of course, SOPA. Yes, I do know that Go Daddy no longer supports SOPA and that SOPA is less likely to exist but the fact that they said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t support SOPA anymore&rdquo; right after Wikipedia and thousands more said they were going to move all of their domains from Go Daddy doesn&rsquo;t make them trustworthy in my eyes. It&rsquo;s quite apparent that they only made that statement because of all of the money and potential customers they lost. Good bye Go Daddy and good riddance!</p>
