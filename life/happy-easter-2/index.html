      <h1>Happy Easter!</h1>
      
      <p>Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was&hellip; Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &ldquo;play all&rdquo; function so that was interesting. It&rsquo;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. I actually started writing blog posts that I intended to post for later.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s new with my life? Absolutely nothing. I&rsquo;m really getting my butt kicked in everything schoool related. Not literally. But that&rsquo;s not new, I&rsquo;m always getting my butt kicked! I just need to pick up the pace and spring break seems like the greatest oppurtunity to catch up and get on my study horse again.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my little to-do list for the break:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Study for a calculus test.</p></li>

<li><p>Trig review questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Physics homework from last week.</p></li>

<li><p>Activity guide on democracy.</p></li>

<li><p>130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start and finish reading <em>Heart of Darkness</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Start reading <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah. I think there&rsquo;s more actually but the most daunting task is those questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I&rsquo;m currently avoiding it but sooner or later I have to do it. I guess looking at that list is motivation in itself. Also, I want to get this done and over with so I have the rest of the break to do whatever I want (sitting at the computer, watching TV, playing video games, and more, haha) instead of doing everything I want first and then staying up until 3 in the morning the day before I go back to school.</p>

<p>On another note, today is my mother&rsquo;s birthday today! She&rsquo;s 53 today. It&rsquo;s interesting how we (we as in teenagers, which I know doesn&rsquo;t apply to all of you out there) get so caught up in our own lives and our growing up but we don&rsquo;t really notice our parent(s)/guardian(s) growing older. Suddenly I notice the wrinkles, the knobby hands, the slightly bent back, and the strands of grey hair. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m starting to appreciate my mom a whole lot more. Happy birthday mom!</p>
