      <h1>Happy Easter!</h1>
      
      <p>I said it! Even though it was yesterday, happy Easter! I&rsquo;m a Christian, so yes, Jesus Christ has risen from the dead! ^o^</p>

<p>Ah, so many things have happened since my last blog post. I don&rsquo;t even remember half of it, haha.</p>

<p>On the 24th of March, instead of having a band practice, we had a concert! We got to wear the tuxedos! I always feel like a man in uniform. It was quite fun! We heard the alumini band, &ldquo;Spiritus&rdquo;, play. And there was the quintet senior jazz band from Bishop O&rsquo;Byrne. They were phenomenal. Bass, piano, drums, sax, and an amazing singer. Oh how do I love jazz music!</p>

<p>Then the following Saturday I had band camp. Nothing special to report there haha. Oh, it was Shannon&rsquo;s first band camp! She seemed flustered. Poor girl. During lunch we played Burn Out Revenge. Racing games&hellip; Of course!</p>

<p>Then last Wednesday, we took sectional pictures before band practice! The flutes took the longest to take pictures. There was 12 of us and each time the camera flashed, someone different blinked! It was frustrating but amusing. The trombones took off their shirts during their session. -.-&rdquo; How typical of them. Trombones are the dirty minded section.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve blabbered on enough! I hope tomorrow will be a good day&hellip;</p>
