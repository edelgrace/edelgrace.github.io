      <h1>Here We Go</h1>
      
      <p>There&rsquo;s nothing like starting a new website on the first day of a month, halfway through the semester, and with my very first responsive design.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited that I&rsquo;m (silently) opening this website but I also have this nagging feeling at the back of my mind. I need to close a few other chapters in my online life. I have two domains that I will be letting go. One is my current blog and the other was a failed project blog of mine. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m a huge domain junkie. I&rsquo;ve spent an embarrassing amount of money on domains. People have their shoes or their Filofaxes<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-14" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-14">1</a></sup> and I have my domains.</p>

<p>Actually, I was just watching an old episode of the Rooster Teeth<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-14" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-14">2</a></sup> podcast and Gus Sorola was saying how it was too easy for people to get a domain name and that they should restrict it more. I understand why he&rsquo;s saying that and I even agree a little but at the same time, I&rsquo;m one of those people he&rsquo;s talking about. You know, the ones that buy a domain but never really end up doing anything with it. I always intend to but somehow that always fall through the cracks. With this blog starting on the 1st of November, I feel like I should blog everyday now. Weird how that works.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started taking the bus to school instead of the train and because of that, posting everyday just might be possible. My commute is now an hour and a half<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-14" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-14">3</a></sup>, which leaves me plenty of time to muse on my day in the form of blogging. The downside is that I feel way more tired on a bus than I do on a train. I almost always fall asleep when I take the bus home. As a classmate of mine would say, #TheStruggle.</p>

<p>Ever since Tumblr came into my life, I feel the need to ironically use hash tags. Does that make me a hipster? #YOLO. #SWAG. #LOL. No really, I literally find myself in situations where I almost blurt &ldquo;hash tag YOLO.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t fit my personality at all either. Tumblr has also conditioned me to react in gifs or curse words in my mind. I&rsquo;m not a fan of this. Thankfully, I quit Tumblr for now but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I still have these tendencies.</p>

<p>Anyway, my sleeping schedule has not been working out this past week. I want to start sleeping before midnight and it&rsquo;s already half past <em>and</em> I plan on waking up early. I need sleep&hellip; Maybe that way I won&rsquo;t fall asleep on the bus when I should be writing blog posts.</p>
