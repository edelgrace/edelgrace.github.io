      <h1>Pretty Men</h1>
      
      <p><strong>Listening to</strong>: Fuyu Tokyo &#8211; Lareine</p>

<p>Alright, so I was writing this, finished, about to press add news, and then Safari closed on me. FML.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the blog post. I want to be like a doll. Sit there and look cute and pretty while wearing pretty dresses. The pretty Victorian porcelain dolls, not the disproportionate Barbie dolls. No, this isn&rsquo;t weird at all. Me and Cloud were talking about Mana-sama from Malice Mizer. I absolutely adore him. He&rsquo;s so beautiful and elegant and just like a doll. The frilly lace dresses, wide mascara eyes, painted lips, pale porcelain skin, and long ringlet curls just make me melt. Mana-sama is just so beautiful.</p>

<p>Speaking of fememine men, HIZAKI. That man just makes me gush inside. He is extremely beautiful. I think he&rsquo;s even more beautiful than Mana-sama. Maybe it&rsquo;s just the cute factor. He has the widest innocent eyes ever. And cute lips. I know most of it depends on make up and photshop (as all VK boys do) but still so sweet and cute. I have a crush on Hizaki. He&rsquo;s so cute and adorable though. I&rsquo;m jealous.</p>

<p>Anyway, enough fangirling.</p>

<p>I was sick today. =/ First period in gym we had the beep test. It made my already existing head ache even worse. And wearing shorts and shirts in a cold gym doesn&rsquo;t help either. So in TA I asked if I could go home.</p>

<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s 11:15 PM. I have early band practice tomorrow morning. I will sleep after I re-write this!</p>

<p>Ahh I would fangirl some more but I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

<p>Ohh a meme I found!</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Top 5 songs that get you through the Valentine&rsquo;s holiday.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>&#8211; from thedailymeme.com</p>

<ol>
<li>For Miles &#8211; Thrice : The lead singer has a lovely voice and I could listen to it for ages. Which I did.</li>
<li>The Heretic &#8211; The Sound of Animal Fighting: It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</li>
<li>Butterfly &#8211; G-Dragon: It&rsquo;s a Korean song by the secod cutest Korean rapper ever. Anyway. It&rsquo;s a really cute song. &ldquo;<em>Everytime I come close to you, everytime I&rsquo;m kissing you, feel like I&rsquo;m going to dream everytime. I get butterflies</em>&ldquo;</li>
<li>A Drop of Colour &#8211; HYDE: I love Hyde. Like really, his voice is so sexy. This song is so mellow and sexy and shows off his English skills. I listened to this a lot. It makes me day dream.</li>
<li>Hikari/Simple and Clean &#8211; Hikaru Utada: Any video game freaks out there? Kingdom Hearts anybody? Square Enix? This is an amazing song by Utada. One of the first Utada songs I listened to. It talks about relationships, overthinking things, and just being content with the now. Hikari is the original Japanese one while Simple and Clean is the English version. I favour the Japanese one because it flows more but I can relate to the English one more.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m done for tonight. I&rsquo;m exhausted.</p>

<p>See you!</p>

<p>_&ldquo;When you walk away</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t hear me say</p>

<p>Please, oh baby, don&rsquo;t go</p>

<p>&hellip;.</p>

<p>Kimi to iu hikari ga watashi wo motsukeru -the light called &ldquo;you&rdquo; finds me-</p>

<p>Mayonaka ni -in the middle of the night-</p>

<p>Motto hanasou yo -let&rsquo;s talk some more-</p>

<p>Mokuzen no ashita no koto mo -about the tomorrow that&rsquo;s before our very eyes-</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Regardless of warnings</p>

<p>The future doesn&rsquo;t scare me at all~</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Mitiete yo -look only at me-&rdquo;_</p>

<p>-Simple and Clean &hellip; Hikari &#8211; Utada Hikaru</p>
