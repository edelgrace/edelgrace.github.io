      <h1>I Moved Hosts to Network Panda</h1>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been with <a href="http://three-words.net">Three Words Hosting</a> for a long time now. I can&rsquo;t exactly pinpoint how long&hellip; But I still had my first domain while I was with them. I remember when I had to jump from host to host because they kept disappearing. However, when I found Three Words, I felt like I could stay there forever. Honestly, I have nothing but praise for Misaki. She&rsquo;s been an outstanding host. What little downtime there is, it&rsquo;s not intrusive. She sends out timely e-mails and tweets whenever there are changes. Her passion for webhosting definitely shows.</p>

<p>Initially, I was being hosted for free. When the packages changed and free hosting was no longer being offered, I decided to change to paid shared hosting. The main reason is because I wanted to be able to contribute for the increasing server costs. The quality of hosting was so great that it would have been a crime to not pay for it, I felt.</p>

<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t work last summer because I was out of the country. Our trip sucked a lot from my savings. I&rsquo;m promised to get some of them repaid from my mom but it&rsquo;ll take a while before that happens. Combine that with the worsening Canadian dollar (I&rsquo;d give anything to have the loonie be worth more than the American dollar again), I looked at my bank account worringly. As soon as I do get a job again, I&rsquo;m highly considering going back to Three Words. Their packages ARE affordable, let me be clear, but not for a compulsive buyer (I blame Steam sales) with no income (like me).</p>

<p>For a while, I scoured the Internet for free hosts or absurdedly cheap hosts. Most of the free hosts did not fit with my space constraints. I wanted at least 2GB of space because 1GB is just too little. Backups can sometimes suck up the space. While I did find amazing packages for less than $5 a year, I was wary. A lot of these websites were new, amateur, or seemingly inactive websites. I didn&rsquo;t want to fall for another &ldquo;fly-by&rdquo; host who just takes my money.</p>

<p>Eventually, I settled for <a href="http://networkpanda.com">Network Panda</a>. I was browsing a forum and saw that they were having a promotion for lifetime $0.99/month packages. I jumped on the chance. From what I found about them, they&rsquo;re pretty well established. The packages themselves were great too. There were some mixed reviews but they were mostly positive. I decided to take the risk.</p>

<p>The payment was smooth and painless. I submitted a ticket for transferring my cPanel backup and received a reply in what seemed like within seconds. The whole process took around less than 10 minutes to have my websites restored to their former state.</p>

<p>So far, so good.</p>

<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve only been here for a couple of days but only time will tell how good Network Panda really is. If things start to go downhill, I won&rsquo;t hesitate to go back to Three Words or find a new host.</p>

<p>So, goodbye (hopefully for now) Three Words. Hello Network Panda!</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m kinda disappointed there are no pandas on the website, like&hellip; Where&rsquo;s your mascot, it&rsquo;s in your company name?!?!</p>
