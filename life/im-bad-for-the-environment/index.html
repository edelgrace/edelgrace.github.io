<p>These days, most people are going paperless. With things like &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; and thousands of web and mobile apps that can do almost anything you want, it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard. However, I&rsquo;m going the opposite way. I&rsquo;m going back to paper.</p>

<p>Easy. Smartphones, while useful, also carry a lot of temptations. Sure, you can have 10 note-taking, productivity, schedule apps but you also have an Internet browser, a music player, and quite possibly, a nice library of games. For me, that is a huge con that outweighs any pros. I admit that I lack discipline, especially when it comes to technology. Adding to that, I&rsquo;m also a huge procrastinator. While I don&rsquo;t game a lot on my phone, it still has the Internet. Once I&rsquo;m on the Internet, I don&rsquo;t resurface for hours. All of those apps I just downloaded to help me? They&rsquo;re forgotten as soon as I click on Chrome.</p>

<p>I love stationary. I&rsquo;ve always been obsessed with stationary. When I was younger, I&rsquo;d always be designing and fantasizing about my dream notebooks. One was like an accordion, each side had a pad for different things. For example, addresses, diary, calendar, sketching, etc. My dreams are somewhat coming true, with the lovely invention called the binder. Now, I&rsquo;ve been debating on whether not to buy a <a href="http://www.avery.ca/avery/en_ca/Products/Binders/Durable-Binders/Durable-Viewa-Mini-Binder-for-5_.5in-x-8_.5in-Pages_17116.htm">mini binder</a> and make a DIY planner or to buy a ready made <a href="http://filofaxusa.com">Filofax</a> with some DIY elements. The former is definitely way more cheaper, but a Filofax can also double as a wallet and I&rsquo;m always up for multi-purpose things (except for smartphones). Plus, Filofaxes are soooo pretty. I&rsquo;ve been drooling over them for quite a while now. Except they&rsquo;re so expensive. Ah!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have a day per page DayMinder that works just fine. It has a lot of space to write on, which is great. At the same time though, it&rsquo;s still summer and I don&rsquo;t have that much to write down. It&rsquo;s still pretty great. I&rsquo;m trying to get into the habit of planning my day out now before school starts. Also, I&rsquo;m practicing my writing because I haven&rsquo;t hand written anything in three months. Ouch! I think it&rsquo;s working. Hopefully it will benefit me in the long run.</p>
