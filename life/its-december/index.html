      <h1>It’s December…</h1>
      
      <p>Yes, it is finally December!</p>

<p>The first day of December was okay. In math I got my last unit test back. 91%! But then I got my quiz back. 64%! My marks have such variety, don&rsquo;t they? I felt like my math teacher was giving me disappointed looks all through class because I did so bad on this quiz. This unit we&rsquo;re doing, permutations and combinations, is really weird for me. I get the answers right in my homework but I&rsquo;m not getting it. I understand what to do but I just don&rsquo;t get it. I&rsquo;m not used to thinking like this. It&rsquo;s stuff like probablity. I was never good at probablity. I prefer formulas that are concrete and don&rsquo;t require much thinking. Ugh, I hate this unit. I said that to my friend with such force and venom in my voice, I think I scared him or made him think I was a freak. Well, I&rsquo;ll just do super amazing on the unit test and then my math teacher will replace the mark. But I hate looking at that 64%&hellip;</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much about today except for the math thing, haha. In spare I just do homework, physics is such a bore, and chemistry isn&rsquo;t something where many exciting things happen. Actually, that last bit was a lie. My chemistry teacher has such a sweet personality. Her jokes are plentiful. Although it&rsquo;s not enough to energize me and keep me awake. I&rsquo;ve never fallen asleep in any class but I&rsquo;ve been close to, especially last period (which is chemistry for this semester).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no drama right now, which is always a plus. Although my friend&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend is getting deported back to his home country (which is the reason why they broke up) which is dramatic but not really. It&rsquo;s quite saddening because they were such a cute couple.</p>

<p>Oh, and I must mention that I opened my very first fanlisting!</p>

<p>If you are a fan of index cards, please don&rsquo;t hesistate to join. ^^ I also applied for a Yukihiro Awaji fanlisting today. I love him so much, he&rsquo;s one of my favourite musicians! Forever my bias.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s all for today. I am once again trying to post as much as I can. I predict many posts with little to no comments as I don&rsquo;t have enough time for blogwalking but I will reply to any comments I receive asap. :D</p>
