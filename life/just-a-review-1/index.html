      <h1>Just a Review #1</h1>
      
      <p>I said before that I&rsquo;m finding it slightly hard to come up with blog topics. Therefore, I am creating a new feature for my blog: Just a Review. It&rsquo;s basically what it seems like: just a review of my day. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a <em>review</em> review but more like a summary. If I rated my days it would be very depressing to look at all the low scores<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-120" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-120">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So, from the beginning!</p>

<p>This morning I woke up. I have alarms on my iPod that go off at five minute intervals. I totally thought I had an alarm for 7:05 but when I finally came to, it was 7:13. It doesn&rsquo;t seem that disastrous at first but it is when I have to leave the house at 7:45! To my dismay I realized that my breakfast was to be porridge. It takes me forever to eat porridge! Although, I&rsquo;m proud to say that I downed that mofo in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>When I got to the station, I didn&rsquo;t get a seat on the bus like I usually do. Not getting a seat on the train isn&rsquo;t a big deal but it is on the bus. The train doesn&rsquo;t make huge turns that doesn&rsquo;t threaten to throw you on the person next to you. As soon as a good chunk of people got off the bus, I grabbed a seat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s getting late and unfortunately I have no time to write the restful this blog post!</p>
