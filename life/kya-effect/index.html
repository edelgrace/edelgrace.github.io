      <h1>kya! effect</h1>
      
      <p>The <strong>kya! effect</strong> is in progress&hellip; kind of.</p>

<p>Ever since the new year started, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of changing the site name to &ldquo;kya!&rdquo; as &ldquo;Ueda ♥ Love&rdquo; can imply that it is just a fansite dedicated to Ueda Tatsuya.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a new layout (hint: <strong><em>J-Rock FTW?</em></strong>) all ready. I&rsquo;m working on the pages. With the &ldquo;kya! effect&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going to focus on my fandoms. Like fanlists, tribute pages, etc etc. Originally, that&rsquo;s what Ueda Love was supposed to be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll still blog! But I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people enjoy my ranting haha.</p>

<p>And of this moment I submitted an application form for a fanlist for the song &ldquo;외톨이 (Loner/Alone)&rdquo; by Outsider.</p>

<p>I LOVE OUTSIDER. He&rsquo;s the best Korean rapper ever. Way better than G-Dragon. He actually speaks about things in his songs. He&rsquo;s pretty cute as well :3 Haha. I&rsquo;ve gotten Dylan to listen to Outsider and he as well now loves him. Ahh yay for Asian music&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway. Valentines Day is tomorrow. Ah. What do I do? How can I show Dylan my affection online? Gah XD Valentines day just complicates things even more. Pressures couples to buy things/do special things together. Why this day? Why buy things/spend time on this ONE day? Shouldn&rsquo;t you just do those things because you care for them, not because the holiday says no? Kinda sound slike a money making scheme. But yes, I guess Valentines day can be special. Feel free to argue with me. Haha.</p>

<p>Ah, fandom.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m watching this really scary anime Dylan told me to watch. It&rsquo;s scary but I LOVE IT. I jumped like three times within the first 45 seconds of it. How sad am I? There&rsquo;s this robot girl named Pino. She dresses up in a bunny suit and is soooo cute. Haha. Only an otaku would probably think that ^^&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh what have I been doing today? Procrastinating on homework. Watching anime. Reading manga. Coding. Website browsing. Only a girl who&rsquo;s really bored looks at the DMW member list from top to bottom. It was fun though!</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t run out of things to say but I&rsquo;ll stop for now. My rants are too long&hellip; Anyway, mata ne~! [See you later~!]</p>
