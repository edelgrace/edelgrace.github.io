      <h1>Lake Parties, Food, School, and . . . Michael Jackson!</h1>
      
      <p>Some updates&hellip; Alright, I&rsquo;ve got the basic Nav links up. Sadly, I forgot the Affies and Linkage&hellip; links. TT_TT I&rsquo;ll fix it later (read the last paragraph). I got my Twitter up, my stats counter, and a new C-BOX! What am I missing? Oh right, actual content! Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m working on it&hellip;</p>

<p>Now back to real life&hellip; Yesterday I went to a party for the end of the year. Okay, it was more like a BBQ but it still counts, right? We ate hot dogs, and chips. They rented sumo wrestling suits, and everyone wrestled each other. It was quite amusing.</p>

<p>Then, today I went to ANOTHER party. It was at the lake. I couldn&rsquo;t swim (I CAN swim&hellip;but I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;), so I played volleyball instead. Yeah&hellip;I epically failed. It was fun either way.</p>

<p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s the last day off school. ANOTHER barbeque, and report cards. Watch me fail my exams. Haha&hellip; And since I can not buy games with my iTunes gift card (stupid Canadian laws!), I resort to buying Michael Jackson songs with a rip offf price off $1.29!</p>

<p>Anyway~ I&rsquo;ve been watching Tatsuya Ueda fanvids! They&rsquo;re really cute. I need to make one&hellip;one day. Haha. Those who don&rsquo;t know me, I am a total Tatsuya Ueda fanatic. He&rsquo;s a Japanese singer from the group KAT-TUN. So cute, lovely singer, and amazing song writer! I have no chance with him, but a girl can dream!</p>

<p>Eh. My mom wants me to go to sleep now. It&rsquo;s only 8:15! And who cares if you&rsquo;re late tomorrow. They don&rsquo;t take attendance&hellip; Well, I&rsquo;m going now! Good night (how is it night time?)! Love ya!</p>
