      <h1>Lent is Over</h1>
      
      <p>Lent is over. I haven&rsquo;t visited Room 304 or Goodreads in over 40 days. Geez, I have a lot of catching up to do. I did read over those 40 days but definitely not a lot. I&rsquo;ve been swamped with school work and going to sleep at midnight every night doesn&rsquo;t leave much time for reading.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve resorted to audiobooks. Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;lazy way of reading&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve been craving some sort of world that I can delve into and just absorb. Lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to audiobooks while doing homework or when I have a free period in class. Somehow I can manage listening perfectly to an audiobook and manage to do calculus questions (and get them right) at the same time.</p>

<p>So far my favourite audiobook is <em>Seriously&hellip; I&rsquo;m Kidding</em> written and narrated by Ellen Degeneres. Usually I&rsquo;m quite weary about celebrities writing books but whew, this one was just so entertaining! Yeah, it&rsquo;s full of laughs but what else do you expect from a comedian? Ellen is just a ball of excitement and fun. Plus, hearing her narrate her own words really made it lively. However, I do want to read the printed version some time soon.</p>

<p>But yeah, I have quite a lot of catching up to do. I wasted my whole Easter Break trying to do homework and I&rsquo;m kicking my butt over it. I said I would do my homework in two days so I can have free time for the rest of the week but that didn&rsquo;t happen. So now I have 130+ questions on <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, couple of questions of calculus, a chapter&rsquo;s worth work of physics, and a workbook in social to do.</p>

<p>After I do all that, hopefully I can update my reading list. Here&rsquo;s what I have so far:</p>
