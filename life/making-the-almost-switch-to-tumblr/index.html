<p>I love WordPress. It&rsquo;s the best content management system for me and extremely flexible. Anything is possible in WordPress. However, lately I&rsquo;ve been noticing a lack in the number of blogs from undergrads and grads alike. I searched high and low on WordpPess, Blogger, etc. Then I remembered: Tumblr. Not surprisingly, the student blogging community is thriving on Tumblr. <span id="more-271"></span></p>

<p>Tumblr is less of a blogging platform, but more of a social media website. I can see why younger people prefer blogging on Tumblr rather than more complex platforms like WordPress. Upon browsing the librarian community on Tumblr, I was dumbstruck. So this is where all of the blogging librarians, potential librarians, and library lovers hang out!</p>

<p>Although I do love Tumblr, I was disappointed. I already spend enough time on Tumblr as it is! I&rsquo;ve been tracking my website usage since December and at one point <a href="http://brokenphrases.info/procrastination-nation/">I spent almost 12 hours on Tumblr in a week</a>. I&rsquo;ve been making progress since then, but I don&rsquo;t want to back to my Tumblr time sucking days.</p>

<p>While trying to find a way to sync the blogs I follow on Tumblr to my Google Reader account (the answer is <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, by the way), I had another revelation: I can post my WordPress posts to Tumblr automatically! Yeah, it kinda sucks out the interactivity with the community but it&rsquo;s the closest I can get without the temptation of spending 4 hours on Tumblr.</p>

<p>But I am faced with another dilemma: I need to post way more. The heart of Tumblr is reblogging. It&rsquo;s so easy to reblog as many things as you want in a short period of time. Content sharers are able to produce more posts than content creators, unless you are both of course. It&rsquo;s also a really personal medium as well (I&rsquo;ve read many TMI posts about, uh, womanly issues on Tumblr). I want approach The Librarian Code more professionally, so don&rsquo;t expect any TMI posts from me.</p>

<p>So yes, I have made the almost switch to Tumblr. Expect more from me, hopefully. :)</p>
