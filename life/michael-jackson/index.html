      <h1>Michael Jackson</h1>
      
      <p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m going to rant about Michael Jackson. Here&rsquo;s a journal entry I made a couple days ago at my DeviantArt account.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been mourning for days now. No joke. Downloading MJ songs, watching tributes, joining Facebook fan pages, watching lives, reading articles, and whatever.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s such a beautiful man even with the white make up and the plastic surgery. You see him smile, and you think &ldquo;Awww.&rdquo; Haha. Old man. XD</p>

<p>The Lisa-Marie blog post made me bawl so hard. I never knew the amount of emotional pain he was in. Of course, it&rsquo;s expected, right? He&rsquo;s fragile. No. He&rsquo;s human. For the first time in a while, I saw him as that. Human. A person. Not the &ldquo;rapist&rdquo; (which he isn&rsquo;t), or the &ldquo;plastic man&rdquo;, or the &ldquo;white but black guy&rdquo;. I saw him as a human, a father, a husband, and a son. He was just really talented.</p>

<p>I regret not seeing him live. Now I never will! AHH!!</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>I love the song Ben. That last verse just reflects Michael so well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben, the two of us need look no more</p>

<p>We both found what we were looking for</p>

<p>With a friend to call my own</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll never be alone</p>

<p>And you my friend will see</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got a friend in me</p>

<p>Ben, you&rsquo;re always running here and there</p>

<p>You feel you&rsquo;re not wanted anywhere</p>

<p>If you ever look behind</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t like what you find</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something you should know</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got a place to go</p>

<p>I used to say</p>

<p>I and me</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s us</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s we</p>

<p>(I used to say</p>

<p>I and me</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s us</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s we)</p>

<p>Ben, most people would turn you away</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to a word they say</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t see you as I do</p>

<p>I wish they would try to</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d think again</p>

<p>If they had a friend like Ben&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t listen to this song without crying TT_TT</p>

<p>RIP Michael Jackson. Our king of pop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So as you can see, I am HEARTBROKEN over Michael Jackson. What I keep asking myself is &ldquo;Was it preventable?&rdquo; Could anyone inetervened to stop whatever lead to his death? Why didn&rsquo;t anyone try harder to stop his drug use? What&rsquo;s going to happen to his kids? What about his tour? Oh sheesh, I&rsquo;m getting stressed over this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going crazy! I love Michael to death.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to make a HUGE tribute to Michael Jackson. Graphics wise.</p>
