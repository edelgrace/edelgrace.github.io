<p>What a coincidence, the song just came up on my iPod. Anyway, a couple days ago I finally decided that I would watch BIGBANG&rsquo;s new music video, MONSTER. I must admit, lately I&rsquo;ve been listening to more and more K-pop these days. I&rsquo;m just craving <strike>more new DIR EN GREY, however they are not inhuman and can&rsquo;t churn out albums out of their asses every day of the year.</strike> new music to listen to and K-pop is new to me so there we go. Also, I have a thing for GD and Seungri, shhh.</p>

<p>Anyway, so my thoughts on the music video.</p>

<p>The beginning actually pretty cool. The prison and the gun shots and the explosions was just so epic. I enjoyed the point of view shots. For some reason I was disappointed that it wasn&rsquo;t the view of actual monster but the band members. Although at the same time, I was just like ASDFGJKL BEAUTIFUL METAPHOR.</p>

<p>So the piano kicks in and my heart starts melting. It&rsquo;s just so melancholy and BEAUTIFULLL. Then I hear TOP&rsquo;s deep lull of a voice and I melt even more. And then I hear GD and I scream inside. But then Taeyang shows up and I&rsquo;m like, WHAT&rsquo;S UP WITH YOUR HAIR?</p>

<p>Seriously, I could not get over Taeyang&rsquo;s hair for most of the music video. It&rsquo;s just so ridiculous like&hellip; I just can&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t even know how to describe it. That&rsquo;s how out of this world it is. It&rsquo;s like he stepped out of a cheesy anime. I just couldn&rsquo;t take it seriously.</p>

<p>I just started and ended that last paragraph with seriously. Wow.</p>

<p>The chorus was pretty good. Considering what I can understand from it. And then Seungri&rsquo;s part. IDGI. Why does Seungri have two lines in every single?! Fantastic Baby. Bad Boy. Lollipop. Everything except Blue, where he sings the chorus (right? I don&rsquo;t even know sorry Seungri). Anyway, another post on why I love Seungri will be coming soon.</p>

<p>Despite all the crazy effects, real life anime GD kicking a statue, Daesung&rsquo;s metal booger, Taeyang&rsquo;s wtf hair, TOP&rsquo;s overall sexiness, and Seungri&rsquo;s two liner, I would say that the most memorable part of the music video is the end.</p>

<p>In the end, GD walks out of a bunker and it&rsquo;s snowing. He&rsquo;s looking around, looking like number 3 from Kids Next Door with his blonde mushroom hair. But then there&rsquo;s these beautiful strings that just pass through your ears and into your heart and the painful gut twisting lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m sick. I think I&rsquo;m sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every time I listen to this song, I&rsquo;m always waiting for the end. Ugh, too good.</p>
