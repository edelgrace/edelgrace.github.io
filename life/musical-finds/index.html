      <h1>Musical Finds</h1>
      
      <p>Man, lately I&rsquo;ve just been scouring the Internet (okay, YouTube) for new music. I&rsquo;m so hungry for new music! Anyway, here are my findings.</p>

<p><strong>Buhar Jerreau</strong><br />
These guys are at the top of my list at the moment. They&rsquo;re a hip-hop/rap group of three guys from Kazakhstan. According to translations of their lyrics, I find them to be extremely talented at song writing. I really am in love with the beats of their songs (I don&rsquo;t know rap lingo&hellip;). They all just make me bob my head. <del>It helps that all of them are really attractive too.</del> From what I could find, they have a dozen or so songs released but not much.<br />
<strong>Favourite song(s):</strong> Мост<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-702">1</a></sup>, Текстиль<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-702">2</a></sup>, 498<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-702">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Yeng Constantino</strong><br />
She&rsquo;s definitely not new to me but my love her has rekindled in the form of this duet cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcXdxynVn80">Kahit Maputi Na Ang Buhok Ko</a> (Even Though My Hair is White). I really love Yeng&rsquo;s voic. So soft and pure. I suspect some autotune in this track though, but that&rsquo;s not to say <em>all</em> autotune is bad. We already know Yeng has a great voice, so it&rsquo;s no insult to her. But yes. Her voice in this song makes me melt. She recently got engaged (not to the dude in the video) so I feel like her feelings in singing this song was genuine.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Panginoon (Lord)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-702">4</a></sup>, Josephine<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_5-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_5-702">5</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>在日ファンク (Zainichi Funk/Japan Funk)</strong><br />
I have absolutely no idea how I stumbled across this band. Their a jazz/funk band from Japan. They get accussed of (I say accussed because it almost always has a negative connotation to it) of being a James Brown rip off. I personally have no problem with this because they are amazing. The live band with instruments are so top. The vocalist has a distinct voice and yeah, it&rsquo;s totally James Brown at times. If you watch performances, you can see the vocalist has moves. Man. Dude can dance!<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> 嘘 (Uso/Lie)<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_6-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_6-702">6</a></sup>, 爆弾こわい (Bakudan Kowai/Scary Bomb) <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_7-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_7-702">7</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Predawn</strong><br />
Another musician from Japan. Apparently her name is Miwako Shimizu. She has a very soft crooning sort of voice that hipsters would absolutely love. I&rsquo;m no hipster but I&rsquo;m still super in love with her! She sings almost entirely in English, I think. Her voice is so soft that sometimes it can be hard to understand her but her accent sounds like it&rsquo;s English (as in London, England). It seems so fluent! And her lyrics are top notch too. Pretty much almost at Joanna Newsom&rsquo;s level of song writing.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Keep Silence<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_8-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_8-702">8</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Astrud Gilberto</strong><br />
A Brazilian bossa nova from the 60s. I absolutely love her voice. Like I said, I&rsquo;m not a musician but her voice at time sounds a bit monotone or flat but it still manages to bring a sense of personality into her music and creates a unique atmosphere. I love her voice and the songs she performs! She also has a cute accent. She was also pretty cute back in the day.<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> How Insensitive<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_9-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_9-702">9</a></sup>, Fly Me to the Moon<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_10-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_10-702">10</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Hitomit Takahashi</strong><br />
Ugh, I forgot she existed! She did some theme songs for a couple of animes (Bokutachi wa no Yukue for Gundam SEED Destiny is the one that introduced me to her) but after I finished the anime, I barely touched any of her other songs. I was feeling nostalgic and decided to check out if she had new songs. She did! I barely recognized her, voice and face wise. She changed so much! Was Gundam SEED Destiny that old? Answer is kinda (10 years ago, wow).<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> Wo Ai Ni<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_11-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_11-702">11</a></sup>, MUSIC<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_12-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_12-702">12</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>MEG</strong><br />
Last and certainly not least, is MEG. I love MEG. I&rsquo;m utterly in love with MEG. She&rsquo;s beautiful. She doesn&rsquo;t have a strong voice and usually relies on heavily mixed and autotuned songs but they&rsquo;re still catchy and great. There is something about her that captivates me. She knows she&rsquo;s cute and sexy and she owns it and she sells it. She&rsquo;s also a fashion designer and wow, her clothes are A+, I think (I don&rsquo;t know about fashiion, haha).<br />
<strong>Favourite Song(s):</strong> TRAP<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_13-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_13-702">13</a></sup>,WEAR I AM <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_14-702" id="back_ajs-fn-id_14-702">14</a></sup></p>

    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_1-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZK_8jh4ySo">x</a>] The music video is really well done. This is a song with a REALLY catchy beat. The chorus is really simplistic but it just hooks you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_1-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_2-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZjyRKFqi5s">x</a>] The comments on the video is all about T.O.P, lol. The main dude, I don&rsquo;t know their names yet, has a voice a lot like T.O.P&rsquo;s in this song. Another song with a catchy beat. I love the industrial booming sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_2-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_3-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeA22r9YnRQ">x</a>] This has like a mishmash of styles. It has a slight &ldquo;I Got a Boy&rdquo; feeling to it in terms of the mishmashing. I admit, my favourite part is at the end when the song is consumed by the melody. Gives me chills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_3-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_4-702"></a>[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOBm9MhdrL4">x</a>] Love how God fearing Yeng is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_4-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_5-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN_YQowvbUc">x</a>] Very innovative in terms of OPM music. None of the recycled ballad shtick. Very calm and relaxing as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_5-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_6-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq1nNykPCDQ">x</a>] Very calm and smooth. The vocalist may be trying too hard to be soft, his voice wavers a lot or is that intentional vibrato? I will never know because I&rsquo;m not a musician. Still love the song though.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_6-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_7-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H14XFS1zVo">x</a>] This song is so high energy! I love it! It&rsquo;s also super catchy. I want to dance around and sing along.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_7-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_8-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58-RRCU0OPY">x</a>] I song that I think I can related to. There&rsquo;s something magical about it. Very whimsical.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_8-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_9-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x2i2GITQ0Y">x</a>] The song that started it all. I loved it because her voice really added to the &ldquo;cold&rdquo; and &ldquo;unmoved&rdquo; aspect of the song.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_9-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_10-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqjiEOLHhas">x</a>] I love Frank Sinatra but I love pretty much every version of Fly Me to the Moon except for his original version. Do I love this version? yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_10-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_11-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10kPphUY8hA">x</a>] Technically Hitomi features in this song but omg. Might as well give her the song if she sings 90% of it, right? That said, I love BEAT CRUSADERS as well. This song is so cute and energetic. I want to jump around when I listen to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_11-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_12-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBy2QcFLLzA">x</a>] Very simple song but very catchy. Not used to Hitomi with long hair. I don&rsquo;t know if it suits her. Her voice though. I can hear a little bit of the old Hitomi but not too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_12-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_13-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BymanWZK1GA">x</a>] Omg. Omg??? OMG??? This song is really chic, sexy, and sophisticated. Has a lot of &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; influence and wow, the clothes. MEG really sells this song. Every time I listen to it or watched the video, my heart races and I&rsquo;m always singing along. I fell for your trap, are you happy now MEG?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_13-702"></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a id="foot_ajs-fn-id_14-702"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AONZnqX1_E">x</a>] I honestly don&rsquo;t know what to say because I&rsquo;m so tired I just want to go to bed. I like this song okay. It has a &ldquo;TRAP&rdquo; feeling to it in that wow, MEG is hot and her voice is hot.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ajs-back-link" href="#back_ajs-fn-id_14-702"></a>
