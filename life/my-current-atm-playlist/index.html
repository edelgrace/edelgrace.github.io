<li><p>All Dead by L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel</p>

<p>The guitar. THE GUITAR.</p></li>

<li><p>4:00AM by Luna Sea</p>

<p>Seductive. Bass. Line.</p></li>

<li><p>Vs. by Misono</p>

<p>Koda Kumi&rsquo;s sister needs more recognition.</p></li>

<li><p>I Don&rsquo;t Care (cover) by MoA</p>

<p>A cover. So pretty.</p></li>

<p>New sound from these guys but surprisingly still cool.</p></li>

<li><p>Ikenai Taiyou by Orange Range</p>

<p>An oldie but a goodie.</p></li>

<li><p>M.F.P. by Sadie</p>

<p>This band makes quality songs.</p></li>

<li><p>Lovers by Seven Opps</p>

<p>Because my brother has Internet radio stations on his PSP.</p></li>

<p>Because a YT cover.</p></li>

<li><p>Bad by Tablo</p>

<p>Because good song.</p></li>

<li><p>For Miles by Thrice</p>

<p>Dustin&rsquo;s voice is like an angel. An angeeeel.</p></li>

<li><p>Like Moths to a Flame by Thrice</p>

<p>I love the double symbolism. I take this song literally and relate it to the Bible. Other Thrice fans foam at the mouth at fans like me (queue 2NE1&#8242;s idc).</p></li>

<li><p>Red Sky by Thrice</p>

<p>And she could take your lifeeee. With just one kiss.</p></li>

<li><p>Can&rsquo;t Take My Eyes Off You by Tommy February6</p>

<p>Tomoko has the cutest voice in the world.</p></li>

<li><p>Stay Gold by Utada Hikaru</p>

<p>I love The Outsiders. And Utada does justice to this song.</p></li>

<li><p>Hikari by Utada Hikaru</p>

<p>Forever a classic. It&rsquo;s like THE SONG for most new Japanese music fans.</p></li>

<li><p>Koishikute by UVERworld</p>

<p>The one and only original song. It&rsquo;s just do beautiful I always want to cry. Guuuuh.</p></li>

<li><p>Catharsis by Versailles</p>

<p>Boss guitar and timpani. It&rsquo;s so epic. And the drums. Hnnng. This song is great on all levels.</p></li>

<li><p>The Umbrella of Glass by Versailles</p>

<p>A very beautiful song. Love the strings in this. Very melancholic. I love the Spanish-y influenced guitar.</p></li>

<li><p>Windress by Versailles</p>

<p>THIS SONG. THIS SOOOONG. By far one of my favourite Versailles song to exist, ever.</p></li>

<li><p>Bright Red Garden by ViViD</p>

<p>I think we all know I like ViViD. I still have no idea what they look like other than the fact that the vocalist has buck teeth. Hrm.</p></li>

<li><p>Hoshi no Ame by ViViD</p>

<p>My all time favourite song by this band. I love it. And this song live is actually soooo good.</p></li>

<li><p>Trail of Tears by ViViD</p>

<p>Another good song by ViViD. Kinda similar to Hoshi no Ame but not really.</p></li>

<li><p>Be Strong by Yazumi Kana</p>

<p>A feel good, let&rsquo;s pump up kind of song. Heard from the PSP.</p></li>

<li><p>Mister (Japanese cover) by Zessei Bijin!</p>

<p>This group is an online YouTube cover group. They specialize in super cute girl groups. This song is just soooo cute. I love the chorus. Catchy. And every time I watch the music video. Those dance moves. I am entranced by Kana&rsquo;s hips. Also. Tonkhai totally shines in this song. Love it!</p></li>

<li><p>Scream (cover) by Zessei Bijin!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s such a shame, a lot of their songs don&rsquo;t start out that great but get better as it goes on. Hence all the dislikes on this song. I love Tonkhai&rsquo;s CL part. A bit low though. The opposite of a falsetto? Hehe. Beibei stole the show though. Almost better than the original. <strike>If only Minnie sang on tune a bit more but her voice is cute so it&rsquo;s forgivable.</strike></p></li>

<li><p>Ugly (Japanese cover) by Zessei Bijin!</p>

<p>Another song that doesn&rsquo;t start that great. But the rest of the parts are perfect. Perfect. Beibei nails it. The chorus is okay though. Someone&rsquo;s releases are annoying.</p></li>

<li><p>Scream by 2NE1</p>

<p>The real deal. THE REEEAL DEAL. I love Minzy&rsquo;s rapping. Pretty dece. And CL. GUURL stop being so attractive. My only qualm about this song is Dara&rsquo;s part. It&rsquo;s a bit weird and out of place. :/ I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it. But she sings it well just&hellip; Yeah. Bom&rsquo;s part. Bom I love you. I love youuu. Also. Girl crush on Minzy. She&rsquo;s so attractive.</p></li>
</ul>
