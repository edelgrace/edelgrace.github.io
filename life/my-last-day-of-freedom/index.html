      <h1>My Last Day of Freedom</h1>
      
      <p>Tomorrow I start university. Thank goodness for Labour day. I&rsquo;ve never really understood what Labour day is. All I know is that it delays school by one more day and that&rsquo;s all I need to know to be thankful for it. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not at all that excited to be honest. Technically, classes don&rsquo;t start until next week so that&rsquo;s delayed even further.</p>

<p>This week is all orientation. Basically, just having fun and getting to know the campus and mingling with other potential classmates. It&rsquo;s all really well organized, from what I&rsquo;ve seen so far. You have to register and everything and you get put into groups based on what you&rsquo;re taking. Thankfully, I know one other person in my group. However, that&rsquo;s also a bad thing in a way. I&rsquo;m more likely to cling and not socialize at all if I know someone else. We&rsquo;ll have to see about that.</p>

<p>So this week&rsquo;s events include tours, games, sport events, going to IKEA (yeah, IKEA, I&rsquo;m not kidding), and more. There&rsquo;s a lot to do this week, I&rsquo;m somewhat overwhelmed but somewhat excited. Excited because it sounds extremely fun and overwhelmed because ugh, people.</p>

<p>This summer I&rsquo;ve been staying at home like a boring person. I haven&rsquo;t interacted with my friends since Stampede week and that was the first week of July. It&rsquo;s the first week of September. I&rsquo;m so accustomed to being cooped up into my room. I might get shocked by being surrounded by a scarily large amount of people (3243 people and counting to be exact). I&rsquo;m nervous. I get such weird anxiety around people. Last Saturday I was freaking out over picking up my textbooks. It went smoothly but I was shaking a little bit. Hopefully that won&rsquo;t happen at all this week.</p>

<p>So yes, my last day of freedom. I&rsquo;m going to spend it on Tumblr and talking to people on Facebook. Well, at least that&rsquo;s the plan. What do I even do on my last day of freedom? All I know is that I&rsquo;m going to bed super duper early because transit sucks&hellip;</p>
