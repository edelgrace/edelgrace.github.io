      <h1>New Layout and Some Other Things</h1>
      
      <p>Yes, after a couple of months, I&rsquo;m somewhat back! And with a new layout as well. I rather like this one more than the previous one. They were both still extremely simple, but I&rsquo;m not a talented designer. I just like writing a lot (I think). With Brokenphrases, I wanted the layouts to be similar to each other. As in, using certain elements (in this case, the logo and the broken two-coloured circle) but with a different structure. I moved the sidebar over to the right (oooh, revolutionary) and removed the footer. There are still some kinks here and there, mostly in the pages and such.</p>

<p>This new layout is supposed to reflect a new change in Brokenphrases. You can see in the nav that there are three new links. Life, music, and books. &ldquo;Life&rdquo; is all of my posts about, well, my life. This will lead you back to Brokenphrases. However, &ldquo;music&rdquo; and &ldquo;books&rdquo; will direct you to my subdomains that are specific to those things. As well, I&rsquo;ve installed a plugin that will have posts from those subdomains showing up here on Brokenphrases. All this fancy talk is kind of confusing, so just go click on the link yourself.</p>

<p>On my subdomain blogs, they also have a new layout that is similar to Brokenphrases. I want to emphasize the link between all three blogs. Eventually I will link &ldquo;my photoblog&rdquo; (Tumblr =P) here to Brokenphrases as well. But I&rsquo;m not used to the Tumblr layouts so that will have to wait.</p>

<p>The main reason why I did this is because I realized I was posting more on my side blogs rather than on here, Brokenphrases. I&rsquo;ve been blogging here and there since April (still not as much as I would like to be though) but it has been happening. Then I realized that not everyone notices my other blogs, or even knows about it. Hence, the linking of my three blogs.</p>

<p>But the reality is, I probably still won&rsquo;t blog as much, despite these new developments. University is coming up, and lol, engineering. From now on, I&rsquo;m just going to post as much as I can. But yeah, that&rsquo;s my PSA of the day.</p>

<p>Currently, summer is decent. My dad leaves for the Philippines this Saturday for two weeks. My grandfather isn&rsquo;t doing so well. He was pretty sick last week, which is why my dad booked a flight. Just two days ago my grandfather was hospitalized. It sounds serious. My aunt (from my dad&rsquo;s side, obviously) and her kids yesterday came over. They&rsquo;re going to the Philippines as well and staying for around a year. My aunt tried Skyping some of my relatives but it didn&rsquo;t work. Since my aunt doesn&rsquo;t have the best financial situation, she had to use our phone to call the Philippines. It was kind of distressing to hear her try to talk to my grandfather. A lot of crying. I really can&rsquo;t take any crying. I hope my dad makes it in time. Minus the situation, I&rsquo;m quite jealous of my dad, actually. I miss the Philippines like heck right now and ugh.</p>
