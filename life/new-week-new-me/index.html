      <h1>New Week, New Me</h1>
      
      <p>Over the weekend I had eaten two plates piled high with sweet American-Chinese prepared meats, a plate full of sweet desserts, and a take-out box of homemade cookies. On Friday I almost consumed an entire bag of buttery popcorn but the bag spilled into the aisle as it descended up the movie theatre steps. As I heard the small popped kernels tumble out of the bag, I felt both relief and disappointment. I was looking forward to eating the buttery goodness the moment I received the free movie tickets as a gift. Going to the movies was an excellent excuse to gorge on popcorn. But I also felt relieved at the amount of calories that didn&rsquo;t pass through my mouth. The next day, however, I walked into the grocery store and bought a box of microwaveable popcorn. My justification was that I would have eaten the popcorn eventually anyway.</p>

<p>So Sunday night I tried hard not to think about all the energy I consumed and how little I exerted. Well, I walked over 10k steps on Friday from window shopping. But it still wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>I made a resolution to myself: new week, new me. I will definitely cut down on my food consumption.</p>

<p>On Monday I grabbed a bag of chips from the vending machine. I had no idea what kind of flavour &ldquo;Au Gratin&rdquo; was but it looked good. The cheesy taste was too overpowering. To drown out the taste I got another bag of chips and a chocolate bar.</p>

<p>Tuesday I baked three cheesecakes. I only intend to eat one and giveaway three but I accidently used 1 cup of sugar instead of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup.</p>

<p>Today I went out for lunch at Tim Hortons. A toasted plain bagel with cream cheese and a cafe mocha. Not too bad but I also plan on eating that cheesecake later today.</p>

<p>New month, new me, probably.</p>
