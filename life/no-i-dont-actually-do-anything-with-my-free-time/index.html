      <h1>No, I Don’t Actually Do Anything With My “Free Time”</h1>
      
      <p>When I tell people I’m only taking three courses they immediately ask if I have a job</p>

<p>I would like one because money but at the same time I don’t tell them that I’m on academic probation</p>

<p>If I don’t get a GPA of 2.0 or higher I WILL get kicked out of university and it will be hard as fuck to get back in</p>

<p>I don’t want to get a job because I don’t want to risk it</p>

<p>And I guess it’s because I kinda want to redeem myself??</p>

<p>I’d rather focus my time and energy on school work and make sure that there is absolutely NO CHANCE that I will get anything lower than an A-</p>

<p>Failing engg was a low blow and I felt very incompetent for getting an RTW</p>

<p>I should have been kicked out of university</p>

<p>But I wasn’t and I got a second chance</p>

<p>I want to prove that I’m smart</p>

<p>I’m fine with not having a job</p>

<p>But I also know myself very well</p>

<p>I had panic attacks going to work over the summer and I’m currently having panic attacks during my lectures idk how I could handle the stress of both at the same time</p>

<p>But that makes me very nervous. How will I ever handle the stress of life after university if I can’t handle going to school (barely full time) and having a job at the same time??</p>
