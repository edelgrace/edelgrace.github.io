      <h1>Prompt #1</h1>
      
      <p>I don&rsquo;t really know what to write about in my blog right now. At first I was like &ldquo;post everyday!&rdquo; but when I got to it, I drew a blank. Not to mention, the 500 words requirement overwhelms me. What can I write about for 500 words??That&rsquo;s why I already missed more than four days of posting. A &ldquo;blog post idea&rdquo; list would be very hand right now. I gotta start writing down said ideas. So I resort to using fictional writing prompts for today&rsquo;s post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Write a scene that starts with the line, &ldquo;Short? SHORT?&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;Sarah Selecky Prompts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Short? SHORT?&rdquo; Daniel bellowed as he held his wallet in one hand and two crumpled bills in the other. &ldquo;The sign said it was only $0.99!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lips of the cashier&rsquo;s mouth tugged at the corners. &ldquo;The sign is for a different product. Many customers have already said the same thing. I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she shrugged and waved the burrito in the air. &ldquo;Do you have another way to pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daniel stared down at his two dollar bills. &ldquo;This is all the money I have,&rdquo; he mumbled. He looked back up at the cashier with pleading eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been walking on foot for days, I need food. Please. I&rsquo;ll take anything for two dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the cashier shook her head. The two stood there for a couple of moments, staring at each other before another customer coughed from behind Daniel.</p>

<p>He gave up. He stuffed his money back into his wallet. On the way out from the gas station, he glanced longingly at a bag of chips and lingered there for a second. The thought appeared in his mind but he pushed it out as soon as it came. He left the store empty handed and with an empty stomach.</p>
