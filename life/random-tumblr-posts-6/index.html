      <h1>Random Tumblr Posts #6</h1>
      
      <p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: Mild The Fault in Our Stars spoilers (Disclaimer: I didn&rsquo;t like the movie)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I saw <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> yesterday and I knew Gus was a jock but it never really occurred to me HOW MUCH of a jock he was. He is such a typical jock. Everything about his character made sense as soon as I realized this.</p>

<p>I only cried once and it was for like a minute and it was during the part where Hazel’s parents were like, &ldquo;It’s ok, our lives will still go on when you&rsquo;re gone&rdquo; because parental moments always hit hard with me. watching this movie has made me want to meet someone who will call me &ldquo;Edel grace&rdquo; again. I’m waiting for literally anyone to be like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your full name?? Okay, I’m calling you by your first and middle name now.&rdquo; Also, woah, Shailene Woodley is Amy from The Secret Life of the American Teenager??? Hair and makeup makes a huge difference.</p></li>

<li><p>I bought myself a 3DS and my brother overwrote my save for Pokemon X. I was only two hours into it anyway but now I have to wait for him to &ldquo;finish&rdquo; the game before I can play. I understand why Pokemon only has one save slot (basically, to make money off families with more than one kid) but at the same time, I don’t want to buy another copy because I&rsquo;m so broke now, haha. Also I’m like 34 hours into Bravely Default. I LOVE it.</p></li>

<li><p>So i went to EB Games today to buy GTA 5 for my brother because it&rsquo;s ~$15 cheaper to buy it used and with my Edge card but I FORGOT I LOOK LIKE 12 and I got carded. I don’t have an ID card or my license yet. So I walked back home to get my passport and it took like 2 hours but it’s ok because I got some exercise. According to my 3DS I walked 12k steps today. Normally I walk like 500.</p></li>

<li><p>There&rsquo;s these two guys in my math class who ALWAYS stare in my general direction every single day. The seating arrangement is kind of in a U shape and I sit at the back of the U and they sit in the front and it’s just like&hellip; What are you looking at?? There’s no clock behind me, it’s just a wall??? Is it because I caught you staring that you continue to stare? I know I&rsquo;m super weird and I kinda talk too loud to my friend sometimes but why you gotta be staring me down in the middle of class??</p></li>

<li><p>I went to see The Giver and I saw the trailer of that one movie with Miyavi in it (the one where a soldier gets captured by the Japanese forces) and I freak out. I was like, &ldquo;That guy seems familiar&hellip; Is that&hellip; G-Dragon?? Nah&hellip; Wait, I remember reading something about someone being in a Hollywood movie&hellip; MIYAVI??&rdquo; Okay but WHY are asians always the evil antagonist?? I know this is based on a true story but come on. I still want to see it though.<br />
But The Giver was not a bad movie. I liked it. Whenever Jonas received memories of the past, I teared up a bit. Like, wow humanity is SO beautiful but at the same time terrible but so beautiful.</p></li>
