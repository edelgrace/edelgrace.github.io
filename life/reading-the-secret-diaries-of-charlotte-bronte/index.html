      <h1>Reading: The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</h1>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;m extremely fond of Charlotte Brontë. <em>Villette</em> is easily my favourite novel and I hold it very close to my heart. A couple week ago I finally got around to reading <em>Jane Eyre</em> and it did not disappoint. The other members of the Brontë family are not to be overlooked either. I enjoyed Emily&rsquo;s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and all of Anne&rsquo;s books are in my to read list. So when I stumbled upon <em>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</em> by Syrie James in the library, I couldn&rsquo;t resist picking it up.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something about the Brontë family that I find incredibly interesting. I&rsquo;m a romantic at heart and the family&rsquo;s strange ability to be surrounded by tragedy is appealing to me. I&rsquo;ve watched documentaries and read numerous articles about them. I&rsquo;ve looked at Branwell&rsquo;s family portrait numerous times and tried to imagine what the Brontë sisters would have looked like. I&rsquo;ve seen George Richmond&rsquo;s chalk sketch of Charlotte and built a picture of Charlotte in my head. I gazed at photos of the moors and wondered at what attracted the family to such a dull place. I envied their love for literature and their eagerness to be absorbed in their fictional worlds. Unfortunately, this all worked against my favour while I began to read <em>The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë</em>.</p>

<p>The first couple of pages were disappointing to me. The book claimed to be written by Charlotte&rsquo;s hand but I (foolishly) despaired at how the style was so unlike Charlotte. Her character in my head did not align with James&rsquo; vision. When I pictured the events, I pictured a woman who was not Charlotte. She was more like Jane Austen&rsquo;s Emma, a beautiful woman with a naive and girlish charm. I could not picture Charlotte&rsquo;s plain face on this Emma. This is not James&rsquo; fault in the slightest. It&rsquo;s my own expectations that ruined it for me.</p>

<p>However, it got better. I eventually came to accept Emma as Charlotte. In a way, I still don&rsquo;t 100% see my Charlotte in the pages. I&rsquo;m not yet half way through the book but I&rsquo;m very engrossed in it. I appreciate all the references and while not entirely in Charlotte&rsquo;s style, it is Charlotte-esque in content. It&rsquo;s hard for it to not reflect any of Charlotte&rsquo;s essence, since much of her work is modelled after her own life and the novel fully appreciates both her work and her life.</p>

<p>So far, I guess you could say that I like it.</p>
