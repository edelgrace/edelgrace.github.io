      <h1>Reading Week (AKA I’m Reading Week)</h1>
      
      <p>I went to the library last Saturday! Quite fitting because it is reading week at university. I&rsquo;m probably the only one who takes the &ldquo;reading&rdquo; in reading week seriously&hellip; Anyway, here is my library haul this week in order of the books I remember first:</p>

<ul>
<li>French Milk by Lucy Knisley<br />
I&rsquo;m always a sucker for personal memoir-like graphic novels. The cover is just too charming to not want to read it!</li>
<li>Negima! (Volume 1) by Ken Akamatsu<br />
The name sounded familiar so I though, why not? I picked it up. Turns out Akamatsu is the mangaka for <em>Love Hina</em>. I predict boobs.</li>
<li>Pure by Timothy Mo<br />
Not going to lie, the cover is what did it for me. So pure.</li>
<li>I Shall Not Hate by Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish&rsquo;s<br />
Apparently this has been on my to read list for a while. I don&rsquo;t know how or why but it&rsquo;s been on there! So I finally decided to get it.</li>
<li>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle<br />
I&rsquo;ve been looking for a book I once read in elementary. This is a possible candidate for said book.</li>
<li>The Selector of Souls by Shauna Singh Baldwin<br />
My library was doing a blind date with a book thing. I thought it would be about tapestries. It&rsquo;s actually about India. Close enough.</li>
<li>Daughter of Xanadu by Dori Jones Yang<br />
Another one that&rsquo;s been on my to read list for a while.</li>
</ul>

<p>Books that I still need to add to the log:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moon Boy (Volume 4)</li>
<li>Moon Boy (Volume 5)</li>
<li>Josephine: A Life of the Empress</li>
<li>The Case for God</li>
<li>A whole load more of books&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently got back into reading online web comics&hellip; That was definitely not a good idea&hellip;</p>
