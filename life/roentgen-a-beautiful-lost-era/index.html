<p>Okay, I love Hyde. I always have. There&rsquo;s something about him that I just can&rsquo;t ignore. However, I just wish I could bring back the Roentgen era. Variety is good and experimenting is all well and nice but&hellip; Roentgen. I miss you.</p>

<p>VAMPS was an iffy time for me. I was fully into L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel and obsessing over everything Laruku related. When VAMPS came out with <em>Love Addict</em> I was excited. &ldquo;OMG HYDE HAS A SOLO PROJECT AND THE MUSIC IS SO SEXY OMG.&rdquo; Yeah&hellip;</p>

<p>But at the same time I was disappointed. I found myself saying, &ldquo;What is this noise? Is Hyde going through a mid-life crisis? What is going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought I could brush it off but then my concerns started showing up in Laruku.</p>

<p>Kiss came out.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Kiss was a great album. I like Kiss. There are good songs on there. However, it&rsquo;s just so different. At least, that&rsquo;s what I thought at the time. Looking back on it now, there are some atmospheric tracks on it that I was wanting.</p>

<p>But. It strayed from what I was expecting and I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much.</p>

<p>I want Hyde to go back to the Roentgen days. The songs back then were just so poetic and beautiful and just created an amazing place in my mind whenever I listened to them.</p>

<p>I understand that bands grow and change but I don&rsquo;t want them going in that direction. I&rsquo;d love to see them evolve into more complicated and poetic lyrics with fancy and creative riffs. Not stadium bubblegum pop. I just&hellip; No.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll sit here and listen to forbidden lover on repeat and weep. <strike>Forbidden lover was such a long time ago omg I can&rsquo;t comprehend that.</strike></p>
