      <h1>Second Semester: Tougher Than I Thought It Would Be</h1>
      
      

<p>My New Year&rsquo;s resolutions aren&rsquo;t going so well. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve broken at least half of them already! But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m giving up on them. I&rsquo;m starting fresh this week, and I will get stuff done.</p>

<p>This week is going to be tough. I have two midterms on subjects that I have absolutely no idea on what&rsquo;s going on. I didn&rsquo;t study as much as I wanted to on the weekend. I went to a 3 hour review session which helped a little bit and doing some homework assignments served as a nice review but still not enough.</p>

<p>Last night I had a weird existential mini-crisis. You know, the whole &ldquo;omg what am I doing with my life I&rsquo;m going to turn out to be a crazy old cat lady living in my parent&rsquo;s basement, that is, if I don&rsquo;t kill myself first&rdquo; spiel. I spent an hour crying and dwelling on my feelings and I felt extremely better afterwards. The downside was that I spent an hour on this whereas I should have spent an hour doing my homework. So it&rsquo;s like 11:45 at night, my assignment&rsquo;s due in 14 minutes, and I still had two questions left to do. A Linkin Park song comes to mind. &ldquo;I tried so hard, and I got so far. But in the end, it didn&rsquo;t even matter.&rdquo; Yeah I got through halfway of one of the questions and ran out of time. Let&rsquo;s just say that I took home a 39% with me that night.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m taking this blog post to repeat my <del>vows, I mean,</del> resolutions that I need to work on.</p>

<h2 id="1-post-more">1. Post more</h2>

<p>The beginning on January was nice. I posted a lot then. Not so much for the rest of January.</p>

<h2 id="3-spend-only-an-hour-per-week-on-tumblr">3. Spend only an hour per week on Tumblr</h2>

<p>I defs broke this resolution this weekend. But I&rsquo;m giving up Tumblr for Lent (which starts this Wednesday) so it&rsquo;ll get better, and fast! I just need to queue about 60 more posts and I&rsquo;m good for the next 40+ days.</p>

<h2 id="5-don-t-skip-any-lectures">5. Don&rsquo;t skip any lectures</h2>

<p>I skipped one lecture. I&rsquo;m a horrible person, I know. We had a guest lecturer (who just happened to be the Dean) and apparently it wasn&rsquo;t that helpful anyway for one of my classmates slept through it.</p>

<h2 id="6-stop-doing-assignments-the-day-before">6. Stop doing assignments the day before</h2>

<p>Why do all of my assignments have to be due on Sunday and/or Monday?? I leave everything to the weekend because I&rsquo;m too busy doing nothing during the week.</p>

<h2 id="12-3-0-gpa-for-this-semester">12. 3.0 GPA for this semester</h2>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t happening. I&rsquo;ve failed a couple of quizzes here and there. But I&rsquo;ll try to get as high as I can.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just realized that my assignment is actually due tonight, not yesterday night. What a relief!</p>
