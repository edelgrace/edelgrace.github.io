      <h1>Seriously Can’t Get Over “Gold”</h1>
      
      <p>I have been listening to &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; by Jeff &amp; Casey Lee Williams nonstop all day. I just love it. It makes me want to dance around and sing. It also makes me feel very warm and fuzzy inside. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve listened to a song that makes me that gushy. I just can&rsquo;t get over the funky discos vibe. Those guitar licks and the strings and Casey&rsquo;s voice&hellip; It&rsquo;s seriously too much to love!</p>

<p>On another note, man, I&rsquo;m already finding that writing a blog post everyday is hard. I don&rsquo;t have any topics! I guess I could do a reflection each day and record what happened explicitly. I&rsquo;ve always loved reading diaries that recounted events. In fact, that&rsquo;s mostly what I&rsquo;ve been defining a blog as: recounting my days.</p>

<p>This morning, I had to write a midterm in my Russian course. It was really brutal, I think. I wish I had studied a little bit more. I think I did okay but definitely not as good as I wanted. Fingers crossed that I passed!</p>

<p>For the next three hours (I have a three hour break between lectures) I worked on my thesis and outline on my Heart of a Dog paper. It was a painful three hours.</p>

<p>Then I had computer science lecture. I found myself falling asleep almost. I need more sleep. We learned more about GUIs and my mind just shut down. My TA walked over and told us that we didn&rsquo;t do so well on our last exercise. News I didn&rsquo;t want to hear. In the words of my fellow group member, &ldquo;We have to step up our game for next time!&rdquo; Ughh.</p>

<p>Bad news after bad news. I went to my ADS to go over my outline for a paper and I just complete missed the mark on everything. I&rsquo;m really struggling with the assignment and I feel like I&rsquo;m grasping at straws right now. I don&rsquo;t know how to read a book in order to do a literary critique. He said not to panic but I am totally panicking. He gave me a lot of good starting points but I still don&rsquo;t know where to go from there. Curse my mostly logical mind.</p>

<p>The bus route I take home stops at another university. Some people got on and it turns out two friends of high school got on as well! It was a pleasant surprise because I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone from outside of university in a very long time. Talking to someone on the bus for once was really nice. Ideally, I would have wanted to work on this blog post but it turns out that worked in my favour since I have more to talk about!</p>

<p>On the second bus home, I slipped on the wet floor and landed on my butt/black. My butt is slightly sore now and I scraped my elbow. It was embarrassing. Hopefully no one saw other than the bus driver. I like to sit near the front and don&rsquo;t look behind me to see if there are other people still on the bus.</p>

<p>By the time I got home, it was already way past dinner time. I ate and then it was already 8:30pm. Then my computer refused to turn on. So I just planned out my week and did some homework that I could do on my iPod. So much for no digital dependence tho semester. I swear I&rsquo;ll do better next time!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m listening to Hitomi no Junnin by L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel and having major L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel feels. I will go to bed as soon as I post this. Hopefully my thing will be ~500 words. There&rsquo;s no word count in the WordPress app. ;A;</p>
