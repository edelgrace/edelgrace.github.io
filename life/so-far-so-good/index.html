      <h1>So Far, So Good</h1>
      
      <p>I am almost done my first month of my second year at university! It&rsquo;s been an interesting year leading up to now. I got into university, turned 18, hated engineering with a passion, sucked at engineering with a passion, went to the Philippines, switched majors (in a transition major right now until I can switch into computer science please don&rsquo;t ask me what it is), got a job as a cashier at Walmart over the summer (don&rsquo;t ask me about that either please), got my courses for this semester dropped, went to fix my schedule, found out it wasn&rsquo;t actually fixed and didn&rsquo;t find out until a few days into the first week, and went to go fix it yet again. So yeah, a quick summary of the last year.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m trying my best to keep ahead in my classes. I&rsquo;m only taking three right now; which is just barely enough to be called a full time student. For this semester I am taking an introductory course to Python, a Russian literature course, and a repeat of a math course that I passed but need a higher grade in to fulfill future prerequisites. My class schedule is pretty light so that&rsquo;s a big relief.</p>

<p><a href="/im-bad-for-the-environment-">Last post</a> I said that I&rsquo;m trying to go mostly paperless. It&rsquo;s going well so far. It sucks that my computer science course requires a computer (which is crazy, I know) and that my math course has online assignments, but hopefully that won&rsquo;t be a problem. I decided against buying a pretty (and pretty expensive) <a href="http://filofaxusa.com">Filofax</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using my page per day (PPD, as I&rsquo;ll refer to it as in the future) planner and I found that I have a lot to do each day. Unless I want to lug around a huge binder planner with me, there&rsquo;s no way I can fit all of it into a smaller sized Filofax. My At-A-Glance DayMinder is working well so far, and I love it. Plus, I can&rsquo;t get over the fact that it&rsquo;s such a lovely shade of orange.</p>

<p>I really love colour coding in my planner. Each course is a different colour not only in my planner but in my notes. I bought some <a href="http://zebrapen.com/products/pen/sarasa-se?c=28">Sarasa SE pens</a> at my campus bookstore. I really like the ink quality and how it looks on the page. I also love how it writes. It&rsquo;s not scratchy but oh so smooth. However, it&rsquo;s only been a month and the ink is running out fast! It could be because it&rsquo;s a gel pen and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s pretty much draining onto the page.They&rsquo;re expensive pens too, so I was hoping I would be using them for longer. Maybe I just write too much! Mental note to find nice coloured pens that don&rsquo;t run out so fast. Fat chance of that, but a girl can dream, right?</p>

<p>While I was going through my endless RSS feed of subscribed blogs (I haven&rsquo;t been keeping up lately, and have a ton of backlog oops), I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.paperlovestory.com/2013/08/preparing-for-university-creating.html">a post from Paper Lovestory</a> showing off Angela&rsquo;s weekly timetable. That post was made exactly a month ago so you can tell where I am in my blog backlog, haha. Angela has a whole lot of cool orangization ideas. I always drool over her expensive accessories (like her Filofaxes). It kinda makes me jealous but at the same time I feel good about the money I save, haha. Plus, the printables she makes can be easily adapted for non-Filofax use, which is great for me! Anyway, the timetable is so simple but it&rsquo;s so good. I took the initiative to do my own. Somewhat colour coded, of course.</p>

<div class="aligncenter">

<p>Disclaimer: I realize I just linked dump and name dropped a lot of companies and blogs so I would just like to say that I compensated in mentioned these and any opinion written here is entirely my own.</p>
