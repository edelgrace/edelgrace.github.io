              <p>I&rsquo;ve been in the Philippines for about five days now. We decided to take a family trip, because it&rsquo;s been way too long since we&rsquo;ve been here. It&rsquo;s been good for the most part. Except it&rsquo;s been an endless cycle of sleep, eat, sleep, eat, sleep with the rare outing. I thought I was going to lose weight here but I&rsquo;m actually gaining, haha.</p>

<p>So if you want to see my Tumblr-ized version of the first two days of my trip (because I&rsquo;m lazy and the heat makes me even lazier), here you go:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Holy shoes I have Internet. And I’m justifying my use of it because my brother is watching my cousin play CoD on the computer (boys are boys in any part of the world) and I have nothing else to do. ;_;</p>

<p>Yesterday I arrived in the Philippines. As soon as we stepped out of the plane, a wave of heat struck us. And I have to say, Noynoy International Airport is super friendly. You know that little link from the plane to the actual airport? There was staff literally lining the walls greeting us. “Welcome to the Philippines. Mabuhay. Welcome.” Pretty darn cool. While we were waiting for our baggage a swarm of people came to help us. They all want to get tipped, haha. But we ran out of pesos tipping just one person and my dad gave five dollar Canadian bills to the rest of them, haha.</p>

<p>The trip from the airport to my mom’s place is super long. Not really but it felt long to me. We left the airport around 10 in the morning and arrived around 6 or 7. I have to the say, I was awake for the majority of the ride and I only saw two stop lights. And they weren’t even in Manila. What I did see was a lot of campaign posters (it’s election time here) and tons of tricycles and jeeps passing us by. My uncle who came to get us likes to overtake cars and it kinda gives me a heart attack every time. He even did it in a “no overtaking zone” and I kinda freake out.</p>

<p>But yes we got to my mom’s place. Every one there is shorter than I am, except for my male cousins and uncles. The women are tiny. My Lola is so tiny and short and cute and wrinkly and toothless and awehh she’s so adorable. She squeezed my arm, said I was fat (in Tagalog ofc) and squeezed me tight. So cute. ;A; Anyway I went to bed after we ate. The rooms are super hot and super tiny so my mom, my Lola and I slept in one room and my brother and my dad in the other. My brother got the room with air conditioning. -__- But it’s cold-ish at night so I guess it’s okay.</p>

<p>I woke up this morning and it was really bright and I thought I slept in really late but it was actually like six in the morning. Welp.</p>

<p>After we ate breakfast (longanisa with rice, basically a sweet sausage) and took showers (it’s literally a small tiled room outdoors next to the chicken coop and the toilet that’s basically just a hole in the ground so it doesn’t really feel like you’re clean because it smells like shit everywhere) we went to the market, or palinki (idk how to spell that).</p>

<p>There’s so many people in the market!! So many stalls everywhere and people trying to get you to buy stuff. And flies. My brother and I followed our cousin while he was getting groceries and it was fun. He was talking to one of the vendors and as we were leaving he spoke to us in English and the vendor was like, “HOY THEY’RE ENGLISH SPEAKING.” It’s really hard not to speak English in public (we might robbed or something like that). But yes that was fun.</p>

<p>We got home and it was only 9. So we just lazed about, taking a nap, watching some TV, and now I’m sitting in a hot cramped room watching the boys play CoD. It’s now 3 in the afternoon.</p>

While I am happy with the results, it&rsquo;s taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I&rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.
So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">FO stands for &ldquo;finished object.&rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!
Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I recently started learning how to use emacs, which is a text editor and a Lisp interpreter. During my quest for resources, I came across a number of developers and their blogs. Since I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</div>

It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&rsquo;t win anything from but that&rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&rsquo;s great!</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Over the weekend I went to Drumheller with the family. Up to this point I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Honestly, Stampede is synonymous with food for me. Stampede means free breakfasts for a week. Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&rsquo;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</div>
