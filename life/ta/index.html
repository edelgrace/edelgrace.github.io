      <h1>TA</h1>
      
      <p>Three days ago, I started school, and I found out that we no longer have homerooms. Now we have TA I went to my TA in the band room and found three grade niners there, and I thought I was in the wrong homeroom, but I wasn&rsquo;t. Oh and guess who my teacher advisors are? The principal and the vice principal! This is going to be one great year.</p>

<p>I have three of my friends in my TA and I have to stick with my TA Until I finish junior high&hellip; b=Vleh.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s this seventh grade girl there, who I noticed was wearing a <em>Nightmare Before Christmas</em> sweater and she was the girl who said my shirt (a Jack and Sally shirt) was cool earlier on. Then, after a confusing day of school (a lot of the rooms were changed around) I opened my locker, and the girl with the sweater asked me, &ldquo;You like My Chemical Romance?&rdquo; as she probably saw the My Chemical Romance CD lyric jacket hanging on my locker.</p>

<p>She just smiled at me and said, &ldquo;I love My Chemical Romance! They&rsquo;re my favorite band!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just stared and just mumbled a reply &ldquo;Uh, I love them too. They&rsquo;re my favorite band&hellip;I mean, second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She suddenly has this weird look on her face and asked me, &ldquo;Why? Who&rsquo;s your favorite band?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I replied with, &ldquo;Green Day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She just smiles again and goes, &ldquo;I love Green Day! I had a Green Day bag yesterday! My name&rsquo;s Madison, what&rsquo;s yours? What grade are you in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I (finally) smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Edel. I&rsquo;m in grade 8.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madison waved, &ldquo;Cool, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow?&rdquo; Then she ran down the hall way.</p>

<p>Today I sat with her and ate lunch, and we were sitting nearby a group of my friends. My friend Patrick just stares at me, Madison and her friends and goes, &ldquo;Is this your new best friend? Are you not best friends with Paige anymore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I was sitting nearer, I would have slapped him. &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; I almost shouted, &ldquo;Paige will always be my friend!&rdquo; so, yah, now Pat&rsquo;s teasing me about Madison but he&rsquo;s the one who forgot how to open a door once! So he shouldn&rsquo;t be really talking.</p>
