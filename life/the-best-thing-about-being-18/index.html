<p>&hellip; Is getting an adult library card. I&rsquo;m not even joking. I detested the teen library card. It was too &ldquo;hip&rdquo; for me. So I rather like my simplistic and pretty white adult library card. The bad thing is that I have to memorize a new card number. Although the number for my new card has bits and pieces of my address and home phone number so I reckon it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>

<p>And so I made my first library haul of the year with my shiny new library card! It took me an hour because I was pressed for time and with the fact that I probably won&rsquo;t have too much time for reading. I finished one of them in a jiffy though.<span id="more-210"></span></p>

<p>These pictures are pretty shoddy, mostly due to the fact that I took them with my only camera at the moment, my iPod. In case you can&rsquo;t read the titles in the pictures, here are the books I took out:</p>

<ul>
<li>At a Crossroads by Kate T. Williamson</li>
<li>The Twelve Kingdoms: Sea of Wind by Fuyumi Ono</li>
<li>The Case for God by Karen Armstong</li>
<li>Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life by Karen Armstrong</li>
<li>A Short History of Myth by Karen Armstrong</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can tell, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Karen Armstrong. I&rsquo;ve read her memoir, &ldquo;Through the Narrow Gate,&rdquo; and watched her prize winning TED talk, &ldquo;The Charter for Compassion&rdquo; and loved both of them. Armstrong is clearly an eloquent, intelligent, and passionate woman, and I cannot begin to explain how much I admire her for it. I can&rsquo;t wait to dig into my first reads of 2013!</p>

<p>I &#8216;m starting my reading with &ldquo;The Case for God&rdquo; by Karen Armstrong first (for now), mostly because I don&rsquo;t want to find myself two days before the due date and finding myself just starting it. Although on second thought I just might read the shorter ones first, but I&rsquo;ll see what happens. Once I get into reading any of Armstrong&rsquo;s work, I can&rsquo;t seem to put them down.</p>
