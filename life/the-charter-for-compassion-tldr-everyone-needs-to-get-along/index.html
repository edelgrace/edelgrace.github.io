      <h1>The Charter for Compassion (TL;DR Everyone Needs to Get Along)</h1>
      
      <p>As a Catholic, I&rsquo;m always working towards understanding my faith, living my faith, properly representing my faith, and lately: being in harmony with those who do not share my faith. A couple of years ago, I was an ignorant little brat, believing myself better than others who didn&rsquo;t actually identify as Catholic despite going to a Catholic school. That mentality quickly faded away once high school began but that didn&rsquo;t mean that I became &ldquo;any less Catholic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried my best to keep a delicate balance between my more secular values and my, well, not so secular values. It&rsquo;s hard. I still try to do this today. More often than not, my secular values seem to dominate over everything else but I still have this longing to grow in my faith and fully live it out.</p>

<p>Earlier on this semester, the campus bookstore was having a hallway sale. It was my break time, I had nothing better to do and the prices seemed cheap enough, so I went ahead and browsed for around half an hour. There were a couple of books that intrigued me but there was one book that kept me coming back to it. &ldquo;Through the Narrow Gate: Life In and Out of the Convent&rdquo; by Karen Armstrong.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This book is a memoir of Armstrong&rsquo;s first 20 or so years of her life. In this journey we see her as a child, a young teenaged girl, a nun, and then back to a child. Despite the fact that the back of the book advertised the author&rsquo;s falling out Catholicism and/or the convent, I bought it anyway. It was a great read and I completely fell in love with Ms. Armstrong&rsquo;s writing.</p>

<p>Recently, I downloaded Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;iTunes U&rdquo; app for my iPod, hoping to find some interesting stuff about engineering and/or librarianship. I was quickly thrown off track with TED talks. Quickly browsing through some of their &ldquo;courses&rdquo; I decided to download &ldquo;Understanding Islam.&rdquo; One of my favourite videos in this course is &ldquo;The Charter for Compassion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I saw Armstrong&rsquo;s face appeared on the screen, I did not know it was her but I did know that she looked familiar. As she did her little intro and started talking in her English accent (in <em>Through the Narrow Gate</em> she mentions going to Oxford), I noticed her immediately.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;The Charter for Compassion&rdquo; Ms. Armstrong first talks about her fascination with Islam. She notes the similarities or the references Islam has with Christianity. Here comes the zinger: Ms. Armstrong then suggests that all religions expresses tolerance towards each other and therefore, she is launching. a &ldquo;charter for compassion&rdquo; that is devoted to uniting people of all faiths. It will promote true compassion towards the other and just being a decent human being.</p>

<p>Ms. Armstrong&rsquo;s vision is beautiful. Unfortunately, it is not realistic <strong><em>but we can come close to it.</em></strong> If only the whole world could look upon other religions with the same curiosity and respect that she does.</p>
