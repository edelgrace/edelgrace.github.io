      <h1>The Scarf</h1>
      
      <p>The sun cleared up his eyes and I was instantly lost.</p>

<p>Even when his head turned towards mine</p>

<p>I could not and would not tear mine away from his.</p>

<p>That colour!</p>

<p>I had never experienced it before.</p>

<p>Warm and clear.</p>

<p>I could see forever in his eyes.</p>

<p>I could feel his disappointment</p>

<p>when he looked into mine: an endless dirt pit.</p>

<p>But he smiled at me then, a sweet crooked grin</p>

<p>accompanied by an equally sweet pair of crooked teeth.</p>

<p>A cat-like curl and a crooked grin.</p>

<p>I had never experienced these colours before.</p>

<p>I really wish I could be able to write poems! Poems are beautiful but like I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;m not a writer. Writers have an innate ability to know and feel words and I definitely do not have that. I tried guys, I tried<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-203" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-203">1</a></sup>. If you&rsquo;re wondering what this is about, it&rsquo;s about a random encounter I had while on campus in my freshman year. I hate how encounters on campus are random. Come back, mystery guy!</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m seriously fading in motivation. I just feel really down all of a sudden and all of the time. But then I remember AJ from U-KISS and I remember that he goes to Columbia and works his butt off (I hope). AJ, please give me inspiration!! And yeah, Eat Your Kimchi has officially converted me into a Kiss Me. I have mixed feelings. Be right back while I go blast some acid android and DIR EN GREY. Maybe with some Sadie and SCREW in the mix. I need more SCREW songs. And I have an album that I have yet to give a full listen through by DIR EN GREY. I&rsquo;m so behind in my music! I wish I had money to buy music. ;A; I need a job but I need good grades. Whaaaat is life?</p>
