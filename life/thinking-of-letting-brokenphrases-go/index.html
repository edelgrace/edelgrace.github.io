      <h1>Thinking of Letting Brokenphrases Go</h1>
      
      <p>I let Pure-Orenji.info go because of money issues. This is not the case here. I don&rsquo;t think anyone (except for maybe one or two people) followed Pure Orenji back when it was a blog. During that time I was going through a weird relationship thing. Also around that time I bought Brokenphrases.info. The name &ldquo;Brokenphrases&rdquo; was highly inspired by my (lack of) social skills and as much as I don&rsquo;t like to admit it, a poem written by the other person in said relationship.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost three years since I&rsquo;ve spoken to that person and we left on bitter terms. I should have gotten rid of Brokenphrases right there but I didn&rsquo;t because I was still clinging onto my feelings for that person. Even though it&rsquo;s been such a long time ago and I don&rsquo;t feel any bitterness anymore (more like awkwardness), I sometimes feel weird having Brokenphrases as a domain. It&rsquo;s pretty much like regularly wearing a shirt that someone you once hated gave you. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still on the fence about it. If I were to let this site go, I&rsquo;d buy another domain name or merge it with another one of my websites. Any thoughts?</p>
