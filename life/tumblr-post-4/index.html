<p>Here’s a picture of all the school supplies I bought for this year (and hopefully years to come). I didn’t spend a lot compared to previous years and I’m so happy. Don’t worry, I ALWAYS recycle and/or reuse my paper!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lined Paper 150 Sheets (x20)</strong> &#8211; Walmart had each pack for $0.10. I know this paper isn’t the best quality but I can’t resist a sale. This is 3,000 sheets of paper for only $2! These will hopefully last me beyond my graduation (good thing my little brother will still be in school then).</li>
<li><strong>Graph Ruled Envioronote Comp Book (x8)</strong> &#8211; These were the cheapest graph notebooks that I could find wih that many pages (80 each). I found them at my university and I’m so glad I researched before going or else I would have bought a different and expensive brand. I already started colour coding them with washi tape on the cover (no, they don’t come like that).</li>
<li><strong>@theOFFICE Multi-Purpose Paper 500 Sheets</strong> &#8211; I always buy this brand, although sometimes I buy HP paper. I need a lot of paper because I’m always printing out lecture slides, letters, homework descriptions, textbook chapters, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Five Star 13-pocket Expanding File</strong> &#8211; Okay, I don’t know why I put this in the picture because I actually don’t use this for school… I use it to file away letters that I receive from my penpals! My old one broke and this one is much bigger!</li>
<li><strong>Pencil Box</strong> &#8211; I regret removing the sticker off the box before I saw what brand it is. It’s just a simple pencil box that slides in and out. So cheap too, compared to other pencil cases I looked at! I found this at my university bookstore.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilo Pens</strong> &#8211; I’ve been using Staedtlers even before I knew studyblr was a thing (I’m not trying to sound hipster, I swear, but I <em>am</em> trying to sound like less of a bandwagoner). I was about to buy a pack of them before I that Stabilos were NINE DOLLARS CHEAPER. I’m so cheap, do you see a trend in this list…</li>
<li><strong>Frixion Highlighters</strong> &#8211; I use these only in my planner. I’ve been using these for a long time as well. Except my previous ones were running low on ink so it was time to more!</li>
<li><strong>Blue and Black Bic Pens</strong> &#8211; Every single school year I buy these. $1 per pack. I either lose them or they explode in my backpack. Now that I have a pencil case (I used to just throw my pens in my backpack), I hope less of that will happen. I use these for lecture notes. I mostly use black and then I use blue to indicate that I want to use a different colour for when I rewrite those notes.</li>
<li><strong>Post-It Sticky Flags</strong> &#8211; I gotta start reusing my flags because I don’t have a lot left! I usually use these in my planner and in my textbooks. Why do they cost so much? Maybe I need to start shopping somewhere else to get them for cheaper…</li>
</ul>
