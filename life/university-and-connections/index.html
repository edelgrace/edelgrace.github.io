      <h1>Preparation</h1>
      
      <p>These summer months has been filled with e-mails from my university and just me chatting on the Internet. As September is coming closer everyday, I&rsquo;m getting pretty excited, nervous, and really bummed out. This morning, I received an e-mail listing all of the things I should get done before school starts. Most of them are finished, but there are three major things that I can&rsquo;t actually do just yet.</p>

<p><strong>My picture ID</strong></p>

<p>I have to submit a picture of myself online for ID card, ONEcard is what my university calls. The only problem is that our only camera (that&rsquo;s not the camera on my iPod) was stolen when my dad went to the Philippines. I&rsquo;m really regretting that. My graduation pictures were on that camera and I forgot to transfer those pictures onto my computer. Good thing I managed to print some of them off but they&rsquo;re really low quality.</p>

<p><strong>UPASS</strong></p>

<p>One of the perks of my university is that we pay a small fee for a semster&rsquo;s worth of transit use. Seeing as I don&rsquo;t drive yet, I need this because I&rsquo;ll be taking the train. They say you can get your UPASS stickers now but you need a ONEcard to put the UPASS sticker on. And I don&rsquo;t have one because I don&rsquo;t have a camera. Ah, what a dilemma!</p>

<p><strong>Textbooks</strong></p>

<p>Textbook lists are finally out and I viewed all my textbooks for this semester, and the total comes around to $450. At first I was like, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not that bad!&rdquo; but then I realized that&rsquo;s only one semester. I want to buy books as soon as possible but I&rsquo;m not sure if I should go secondhand or if I should even buy all of them. I have to wait a couple of hours anyway because I don&rsquo;t have a credit card.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I went shopping for school supplies a couple of days ago. It doesn&rsquo;t look like a lot on paper, but it actually is a lot, as I&rsquo;m sure most of you will know. So here&rsquo;s what I got:</p>

<ul>
<li>A crap load of pens, pencils, erasers, and highlighters</li>
<li>Sticky notes and sticky page flag thingies</li>
<li>A binder</li>
<li>An expandable file folder (a suggestion from <a href="http://fadedout.com">Kim</a> in this <a href="http://fadedout.com/2012/04/13/tips-for-success-in-school/">article</a>)</li>
<li>A planner agenda thingy</li>
<li>A couple of notebooks</li>
</ul>

<p>So while all of that is happening, I&rsquo;m talking to my Internet friends. One of my friends is a math genius. He&rsquo;s going to Oxford for goodness sakes. He was showing me some of the tests he took and I realized that I really don&rsquo;t remember anything I learned last semester. Differentiate? Gradient? Tangent lines? I&rsquo;m thinking that I need to brush up on my calculus and all around math skills before I go back to university. Like&hellip; It looks quite manageable but my mind is drawing a blank right now. I should probably go hit the books&hellip;</p>
