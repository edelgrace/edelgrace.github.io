      <h1>Wanting to Write</h1>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to document my life in a journal. There is something awfully romantic about keeping an account of your day to day life. I just read a book, <a href="http://books.erzadel.net/index.php?p=books.fairyland-a-memoir-of-my-father">Fairyland by Alysia Abbott</a>, about a woman who grew up with a single gay father in the &lsquo;80s. She reconstructed both her and her father&rsquo;s life through his journals and their letters to each other. I find it so beautiful.</p>

<p>Is it because I want to leave behind some sort of proof of my existence? Will I even have anyone to read my writings when I&rsquo;m gone? I don&rsquo;t even want to have kids eventually, at this point of my life. Maybe my life isn&rsquo;t even that interesting to keep up a diary. But I do love reading my old blog posts, no matter how cringe they are.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I&rsquo;d keep physical accounts of my life. I&rsquo;m still bitter over the fact that my mother takes it upon herself to read my journals now. I love the physical act of writing and the tangibility of writing makes is seem so much more precious. But then I found out my mother has been snooping. One day she mentioned a topic that I never told her about, but something that I had wrote. I was so extremely angry but I didn&rsquo;t say anything. It&rsquo;s not like I just leave my journals out in the open. I take lengths to hide them but my mother still manages to find them. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not as clever as I think I am.</p>

<p>I took up writing in <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/elianscript.htm">Elian script</a> to counteract this. However, decoding my entries took way too long. I recently found an easier script to read, <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/liron.php">Liron</a>. But I am so resentful (I looked up synonyms for bitter, haha) that I have to go through these measures.</p>

<p>I want to take up writing frequent blog posts, at the price of making these posts private. But what if my blog gets hacked? There&rsquo;s a little more risk involved than having my mother read my journals. I&rsquo;m really conflicted.</p>
