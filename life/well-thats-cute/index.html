      <h1>Well, That’s Cute</h1>
      
      <p>I was browsing through some blogs yesterday and came across a blog dedicated to a cat. The blog, <a href="http://sisinmaru.blog17.fc2.com/">I Am Maru</a> is ridiculously cute. It&rsquo;s about a cat named Maru who lives in Japan. The owner likes to take pictures of Maru and put cute captions underneath it. I really think it&rsquo;s adorable.</p>

<p>I love cats. They&rsquo;re just so fluffy and moody (for some reason, that&rsquo;s what I love about them). Sadly, I&rsquo;m 99% sure I&rsquo;m allergic to cats. My eyes get red, puffy, and watery whenever I&rsquo;m around cats. I also sneeze like a maniac. It&rsquo;s unfortunate because I&rsquo;ve always loved cats. Maybe one day I could get a hairless or hypoallergenic cat. Like a sphynx or something. Although, anything that&rsquo;s hairless kinda freaks me out. Remember Kim Possible? I looked at a real picture of a real naked mole rat because of it. After that, I was never the same again. Sphynx cats kinda looks cute though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I start school in nine days. I&rsquo;m excited but a bit scared. My last year of high school! Then I&rsquo;ll be somewhat pushed into the real world.</p>

<p>I took some of your suggestions and started looking at scholarships and such. There&rsquo;s a lot of them. I found this one scholarship that give $3,000 for every year for three years if you&rsquo;re studying on the oil and gas industry, which is exactly what I&rsquo;m planning on doing. That would be <strong>a lot</strong> of help. So I&rsquo;m going to have to work even harder this year. My schedule is packed and I anticipate a whole load of work. Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna relax as much as I can over the next nine days.</p>
