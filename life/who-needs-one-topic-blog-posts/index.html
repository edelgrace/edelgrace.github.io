<p>I quit Tumblr for Lent. It&rsquo;s only been a couple of days, and I&rsquo;ve accumulated so many Tumblr blog posts in my mind and it&rsquo;s kinda driving me crazy. So crazy to the point where a Tumblr and serious blog crossover is inevitable. Tumblr posts are mostly Twitter-like in nature, except ten times the sarcasm, ten times the ironic usage of poor grammar and spelling, and ten times that length. Not to mention the heavily fangirling where everyone assumes that everyone else knows what they&rsquo;re talking about, even if they&rsquo;re not in the fandom (I tried so hard to make this sentence make sense but this is all I got).</p>

<h4 id="ugh-no-wow-stop">Ugh no wow stop</h4>

<p>Attractive engineering guy is really attractive. I haven&rsquo;t seen him since like semester. Now I go to a different lecture for my statics course because my statics prof confuses me. I found out that attractive engineering guy was in the lecture and we&rsquo;ve been sitting together lately. It&rsquo;s nice. I love watching his mouth when he talks. One side of his mouth goes crooked. Really cute. Although he tends to mumble/speak really softly. Combined with the accent I&rsquo;m constantly saying &ldquo;Pardon? Oh goodness, sorry, I didn&rsquo;t hear that&#8230; What? Say that again? &#8230; Pardon?&rdquo; I also noticed that his hair seems to look lighter. I thought it was jet black (or really close to black) but now it looks like a warm and dark chestnut. I also feel stupid now, he got a B+ in the subject I did the worst in and said he wasn&rsquo;t smart. Brb crying in a corner now.</p>

  </div>

<h4 id="jake-why">JAKE WHY</h4>

<p>Today the family and I were eating a nice, quiet dinner and then Homestuck got updated. I know this because my dad suddenly said, &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; It was the sound of my laptop blasting Cascade, the song my update checking software plays every time there&rsquo;s a new Homestuck update. I wanted to go turn it off but my mom was all, &ldquo;No! Stay at the dinner table, no one&rsquo;s supposed to leave until we&rsquo;re all done eating!&rdquo; So we spent the rest of the dinner awkwardly talking over Cascade while I was drowning in tons of Cascade related feels.</p>

<h4 id="holy-crap-that-upd8">HOLY CRAP, THAT UPD8</h4>

<p>KARKAT IS BACK. HOLY ADKHFJKLASDHFKLAJSHF. YES. BBY I MISS YOU. I MISS ALL THE TROLLS. VRISKA WHERE ARE YOUUUU.</p>

<p>WAIT IS HE TALKING INTO A LOBSTER.</p>

<p>(Note: This is a typical Tumblr post for me. Yeah. Tumblr culture is significantly different than the sophisticated blogosphere).</p>

<h4 id="i-m-srsly-so-stupid">I&rsquo;m srsly so stupid</h4>

<p>My chem lab partner is kinda cute, hahahahahaha</p>

<p>*flied out the window*</p>

<p>But I seriously ruined our lab experiment and I just. WHY??</p>

<h4 id="i-take-reading-week-seriously">I take reading week seriously</h4>

<p>I went to the library today and got some awesome possum books. I was delighted to see that my local library had the &ldquo;blind date with a book&rdquo; booth set up. So I picked one up. It was labelled as &ldquo;a wonderfully woven tapestry&rdquo; or something like that. At first I was like, OH GOD A BOOK ABOUT TAPESTRIES HOW HARD CORE IS THAT THIS BOOK SPEAKS TO ME. But it&rsquo;s actually a book about India. That&rsquo;s cool too, but I was disappointed. One day I&rsquo;m going to write a book about five little old ladies in a tapestry weaving club. Now <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> hard core. (I&rsquo;m not even joking I&rsquo;ve got the whole thing planned out).</p>

<h4 id="always-there">Always there</h4>

<p>To the man and his son who I never fail to see every Saturday sitting in front of the religious books whenever I go to Fish Creek,</p>

<p>I assume the worst. The public library is public after all. The first two times I saw you two sitting there, I thought nothing of it. But both times neither of you were looking at the books. This time you were just holding your son, both of you in your own world. I don&rsquo;t know your story. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re always here. But I hope that whatever happens in your life, it will only be good things.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-you-from">Where are you from?</h4>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> Where are you from?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Canada</p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> No like, where are you from?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Canada???</p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> NO. WHERE. ARE. YOU. FROM?</p>

<p>I got this question asked to me yesterday. Twice. I decided to not be sassy and just said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Filipino. I was born here.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s funny whenever people ask me that question. Kinda like how they assume everyone&rsquo;s an immigrant (which is technically true if you go far back enough and if you&rsquo;re not First Nations).</p>

<h4 id="those-midterms-gfdi">Those midterms gfdi</h4>

<p>I had two midterms today. Pretty sure I failed both of them. I&rsquo;m 100% sure I&rsquo;ll do better on the remaining midterms though because I actually know what&rsquo;s going on in those courses.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird how that after I write I write a hard test, I am filled with self loathing. Not just the &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;m so stupid why do I procrastinate I hate myself&rdquo; self loathing you&rsquo;d expect after an academic failure but the &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;m a horrible person like that one time I said a bad thing about that one person x years ago&rdquo; kind of self loathing. I don&rsquo;t understand how that works.</p>

<h4 id="can-t-wait-for-summer">Can&rsquo;t wait for summer!</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s official. We&rsquo;re going to the Philippines for the month of May! My mom just picked up the plane tickets a couple of days ago. I&rsquo;m super excited. I can&rsquo;t wait. I just need to get through this gosh darn awful semester first. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll happen&#8230;</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with Hugo lately. A couple of weeks ago, I exported my old Wordpress blog into Hugo. While I am happy with the results, it&rsquo;s taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I&rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.
So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I follow the blog baty.net in which Jack Baty continuously finds new tools and new ways to improve his productivity. While I usually scoff at people who are always changing things up, I will admit that I am the exact same way. It would be great to just stick to something tried and true and never have to think about changing but there is just so much out there that it&rsquo;s hard for me to resist the temptation to not try everything I can see.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">FO stands for &ldquo;finished object.&rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</div>

He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</div>

If you don&rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!

Since I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</div>

It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&rsquo;t win anything from but that&rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&rsquo;s great!</div>

Up to this point I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</div>

Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&rsquo;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</div>
