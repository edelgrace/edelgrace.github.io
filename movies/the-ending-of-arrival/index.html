              <p>I finally got to watch <em>Arrival</em> the other day. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly everything that I expected but I think I wasn&rsquo;t displeased with the twist.</p>

<p>The fist half of the movie follows Louise, a professor who specializes in languages and translations. She is recruited by the government to help translate the language of aliens who had touched down on earth. Together with a mathematician, Ian, they slowly learn the writing system of the aliens.</p>

<p>At the climax, the aliens are at risk of being attacked by multiple countries around the world. This is when it is revealed that Louise can experience the future. She uses her glimpses of the future to piece together how exactly she had to prevent the attack on the aliens.</p>

<p>Throughout the movie, Louise had been seeing visions of her child. I initially thought these were flashbacks from the past and that the stress of sleepless nights had resurfaced painful memories for Louise. What was really happening was that Louise had been experiencing the future and the present simultaneously.</p>

<p>Louise marries her partner Ian and have a child together and that child is the one Louise had seen in her episodes into the future. While still in the present, Louise experiences multiple memories with her daughter Hannah and eventually learns that Hannah has an incurable disease that causes her to die in her teens.</p>

<p>This part of the movie caused great confusion for my SO and I.</p>

<p>If Louise knew that her daughter would have to suffer and die early, why did she choose to have her at all?</p>

<p>One of the arguments that I think is the most forgivable is that Louise is not able to control the outcome of her future, despite being able to see it. That is, her future is predetermined and she can&rsquo;t change her future no matter what. So it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that she knows what&rsquo;s going to happen if she can&rsquo;t change it.</p>

<p>A counter argument is that when she experiences the future, it is happening and she can make choices. There is hard evidence in the movie that supports this argument. When Louise is talking to her daughter at the lake, she asks her what day it is because she isn&rsquo;t sure that what is happening is real or just a vision. Another scenario is when she is trying to think of a term for her daughter and it isn&rsquo;t until she hears someone say it in the present that she can tell her daughter the term in the future.</p>

<p>In terms of morality, I have mixed feelings. Is it immoral of Louise to bring her daughter into the world if she knew her daughter would suffer? It&rsquo;s a touchy subject and I cannot come to a complete decision on the topic.</p>

<p>On one hand, I&rsquo;m a firm believer of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better to have loved and lost than to not love at all.&rdquo; As a result of knowing Hannah&rsquo;s future, Louise is able to cherish each and every moment with her daughter. She loves Hannah with ever fiber of her being. Who&rsquo;s to say that Hannah&rsquo;s happier years weren&rsquo;t worth it?</p>

<p>While I also believe in a women&rsquo;s choice to do whatever she wants with her body, this situation is different because her actions absolutely impacts another person&rsquo;s life negatively. It&rsquo;s unfair that someone so young and just beginning her life would have it cut short. Some people might say it is cruel and irresponsible for Louise to bring her daughter into the world.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what to think of it but I keep turning it over in my mind. Louise doesn&rsquo;t really have a rare circumstance. Some people have genetic disorders that can be passed down to their own kids. They have to choose whether or not they want to have kids or not. Some find out about a condition while the child is not yet born and they are faced with the same decision.</p>

<p>Is it up to the parents? Do some situations call for different actions or is there a universally ethical way of handling it? I don&rsquo;t know myself. I hope I don&rsquo;t have to choose and if I do, I hope I&rsquo;ll be confident in my answer.</p>

I&rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.
So here I am. A new portfolio. A technically new site.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">FO stands for &ldquo;finished object.&rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!
Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I recently started learning how to use emacs, which is a text editor and a Lisp interpreter. During my quest for resources, I came across a number of developers and their blogs. Since I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</div>

It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&rsquo;t win anything from but that&rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&rsquo;s great!</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Over the weekend I went to Drumheller with the family. Up to this point I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Honestly, Stampede is synonymous with food for me. Stampede means free breakfasts for a week. Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&rsquo;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</div>
