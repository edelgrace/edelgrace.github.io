              <p>Disclaimer: Lyrics relating to suicide is mentioned in this post.</p>

<p>Another disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not good at writing reviews but I do like expressing my opinions. This is in no way a professional review but rather how I personally feel about this album.</p>

<p>I know Marina and the Diamonds&rsquo; album <em>Electra Heart</em> is one of her personally least favourite works but I like it a lot. Many people think <em>Electra Heart</em> represents an alter-ego but it&rsquo;s rather a personality that Marina holds in disdain. I actually kinda love it. While some songs do resonate with my own personality, the overall theme of the corrupted American dream doesn&rsquo;t coincide with my reality. But you have to admit that there are some catchy tunes on this album.</p>

<p>The album starts off with <em>Bubblegum Bitch</em>, which I was really apprehensive about at first. It turned out to be a really high energy song with a fun and catchy chorus. The guitar ripping througg the song really made it for me. It added a certain ironic feel that set the tone for the rest of the album.</p>

<p>The much loved <em>Primadonna</em> comes right after. It&rsquo;s a little jarring to think about two different types of people as the topic one after the other (although, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive personalities). However, this was the song that got me sucked into Marina and the Diamonds. I hate to say it but Marina&rsquo;s voice is perfect for capturing the entitled persona in this song and I fall all over it. Even though you know she doesn&rsquo;t deserve anything good, you can&rsquo;t help but give it to her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not a huge fan of <em>Lies</em>. I like slower songs but I really hate that cheesy drum clap thing going on. It&rsquo;s not you, Marina, it&rsquo;s me.</p>

<p><em>Homewrecker</em> is a favourite of mine. I love the image a stereotypical American woman casually destroying marriages. Okay, that sounded bad. I don&rsquo;t condone that at all but I just find it amazing how well this song captures the stereotype. It&rsquo;s so easy to picture this person in your head.</p>

<p>The next track on the album is another one of my favourites: <em>Starring Role</em>. While thinking about this song, I realized how self centered all the songs on the album are so far and this is no exception. This song speaks about being the number one in someone&rsquo;s life and not willing to take second place. However, it&rsquo;s not as selfish as it sounds and I can sympathize with it. I also can overlook the cheesy clapping because I get chills whenever Marina sings &ldquo;The starring role.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will have to admit that I don&rsquo;t have any strong feelings for <em>The State of Dreaming</em>. I like how it picks up during the chorus and they way Marina sings &ldquo;My life is play&rdquo; but in between those moments, it&rsquo;s a little boring. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s a song that I would skip sometimes.</p>

<p><em>Power and Control</em> is true to its name and Marina&rsquo;s voice just exudes the song&rsquo;s theme. There&rsquo;s something about that booming voice that portrays confidence that the song calls for; someone ambitious who wants to get as much as possible with as little work as possible.</p>

<p>A lot of people seem to like <em>Teen Idle</em> a lot but I think this is one of my least favourite tracks on the album. The teen angst is just too much for me. Much of this album is over the top and extravagant but I can&rsquo;t seem to enjoy this. I find the song a little bit boring but I like the irony in how the line &ldquo;feeling super, super, super (super!) suicidal&rdquo; is executed in a cheery way. But this song doesn&rsquo;t jive with me at all.</p>

<p>The slow songs continue with <em>Valley of the Dolls</em>. While this isn&rsquo;t a super favourite, I don&rsquo;t mind this song much. I like the chorus a lot and the lyrics are pretty relatable. In my opinion, this song speaks of donning multiple personalities but ultimately not knowing who you really are at the core. It&rsquo;s a pretty dark and speaks of death. Death of another personality or the physical person, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>I understand that the album is essentially a concept album that is operatic and has a story arch in the fashion as Green Day&rsquo;s <em>American Idiot</em> but it&rsquo;s a little bit draining to have so many slow songs in a row. There are theories that this album&rsquo;s second half indicated the dying of the Electra Heart persona. This is not to say that <em>Hypocrates</em> isn&rsquo;t a good song but I prefer it when I&rsquo;m not listening to the album as a whole. I really like the mellow guitar and and the twinkling strings and Marina&rsquo;s voice taking a softer and less abrasive tone. This is another song that I don&rsquo;t mind much but don&rsquo;t like it enough to save it to my Spotify library.</p>

<p>The album finishes off with <em>Fear and Loathing</em> which marks the end of Electra Heart. I do not like this song much. However, I am impressed with Marina&rsquo;s higher register even if I still prefer when she reaches those lower notes. Conceptually, it isn&rsquo;t a bad way to end the album.</p>

<p>Overall, I drastically prefer the first half of the album. I like this album but it&rsquo;s not one I&rsquo;d go out of my way to buy but rather buy select songs off of it. The concept is interesting and Marina doesn&rsquo;t play around when it comes to her lyrics. It&rsquo;s pretty cohesive as a whole. I really admire Marina and I like how she is continually trying out different things. Let&rsquo;s see where she goes next with her music!</p>

While I am happy with the results, it&rsquo;s taking me a bit of time to go through each of my posts (of which there are hundreds of) and update the metadata. I&rsquo;m quite tempted to leave it as is but I enjoy consistency.

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I follow the blog baty.net in which Jack Baty continuously finds new tools and new ways to improve his productivity. While I usually scoff at people who are always changing things up, I will admit that I am the exact same way. It would be great to just stick to something tried and true and never have to think about changing but there is just so much out there that it&rsquo;s hard for me to resist the temptation to not try everything I can see.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">FO stands for &ldquo;finished object.&rdquo; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&rsquo; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&rsquo;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&rsquo;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&rsquo;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&rsquo;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I recently started learning how to use emacs, which is a text editor and a Lisp interpreter. During my quest for resources, I came across a number of developers and their blogs. Since I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&rsquo;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</div>

I might need three cakes for this though and not the two that I have.</div>

It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&rsquo;t win anything from but that&rsquo;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&rsquo;s great!</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Over the weekend I went to Drumheller with the family. Up to this point I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&rsquo;s newborn son. I guess he isn&rsquo;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Honestly, Stampede is synonymous with food for me. Stampede means free breakfasts for a week. Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&rsquo;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</div>
