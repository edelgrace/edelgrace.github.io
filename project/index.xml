      <description>Sample screenshot    Source code Download How to Run  The &amp;ldquo;Problem&amp;rdquo; When was the last time you looked up at the stars? If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and live in a big city, you might not even remember when the last time you could properly see a star that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the sun. Of course there may be astronomy enthusiasts out there who make a hobby out of looking at the night sky but for the rest of us, we&amp;rsquo;re wannabe casual star gazers.</description>

      <description>Source code Download How to Run  The &amp;ldquo;Problem&amp;rdquo; In this day and age, instant communication is a given. This makes long distance relationships more feasible. Sometimes though, pulling out a phone or your web browser to log onto Facebook isnâ€™t suitable for all situations when you want to send a quick message to your significant other. Additionally, instant communication can even become too routine and not carry a lot of weight.</description>

      <description>Source code Download How to Run  The &amp;ldquo;Problem&amp;rdquo; The goal of this project was to design a button that would delight its user and respect some aspects of their personality. In this case, the user was a fellow classmate of mine. After some interviewing, I determined the following:
 She watches a lot of movies but no horror or rom coms please She has a double major in psychology and lingusitics She wants a pet box turtle and a cat named Aang (like from Avatar: The Last Airbender) She works a lot and enjoys it (just wishes she would get paid more) She listens to a lot of podcasts some which are movie related and some are DnD related (but she&amp;rsquo;s never played DnD before) She likes the X-men!</description>
