          <p>

<p>So this year I went to a bunch of concerts. Two of those concerts (<a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/thoughts-on-alexisonfire-and-billy-talent/">Alexisonfire</a> and <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/thoughts-on-coheed-and-cambria/">Coheed and Cambria</a>) were big wish listers for me and this got me thinking. What other artists do I want to see live?</p>

<h3 id="l-arc-en-ciel">L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel</h3>

<p>I know for sure that I want to see <strong>L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel</strong> live in concert. L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is a band I got into around junior high. Thanks to the power of the Internet, I know approximately the first time I fell in love with L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel. I used to watch anime all the time on YTV, one of the cartoon networks in Canada. They aired <em>Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa</em> on <strong>October 19, 2007</strong> where L&rsquo;Arc did two songs on the soundtrack and I loved them immediately.</p>

<p>I remember when L&rsquo;Arc performed in Madison Square Garden a couple of years ago, I was insanely jealous. I watched the footage, the concert reviews, the fan interviews and <strong>bawled my eyes out</strong>. Even now, the mere thought of the possibility of seeing L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel live in concert is bringing tears to my eyes. Actually, at this moment I&rsquo;m listening to their 25th Anniversary live disc and I&rsquo;m very emotional right now (yes, this is what spurred this post).</p>

<p>And a couple years ago, when they were planning their world tour they asked for suggestions for cities to go to and I spammed Canadian cities so hard. Of course, they never came. But I so desperately want to see them live one day.</p>

<p>L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is definitely a classic band for me. I remember making this post a like six years ago on Tumblr (god, remember all the confession tumblrs back then??). It&rsquo;s still true to this day.</p>

      <figcaption><h4>L&#39;Arc~en~Ciel is my one and only real favourite band, even though I&#39;ve gone through periods of not listening to them for months on end. They&#39;re the only band that I can come back to after a long time and listen to their songs as if I&#39;ve listen to it for the first time and love it with the same intensity as before</h4>

<p>I say &ldquo;I can die happy now&rdquo; after like every concert I&rsquo;ve been to but seeing L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel would be <em>the concert</em> that would actually make the statement true. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to see them for 11 years now. I hope to god L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel will continue touring until I can see them.</p>

<h3 id="björk">Björk</h3>

<p>One of my friends asked once me who my musical goddess was (no joke) and when I answered with <strong>Björk</strong> he was surprised. &ldquo;I thought it would be Beyonce,&rdquo; is what he replied. No offense to Beyonce (love her, she&rsquo;s amazing and empowering and makes great music) but she is definitely not on the level of artistry as Björk.</p>

<p>I remember watching TV in the dark late at night on MTV and Björk&rsquo;s <em>Bachelorette</em> came on. I was entranced. This big voice coming out of a rather small woman wearing jeans and what seemed like a dress. I listened to so much Björk ever since.</p>

<p>Admittedly, some of her latest music kinda flies over my head nowadays but what I would give to see her live in concert.</p>

<h3 id="joanna-newsom">Joanna Newsom</h3>

<p>Continuing the trend of amazing women musicians&hellip; Joanna Newsom. I would love to see her live as well. I remember my ex in high school was the one who introduced her to me. I thank god I never think about him whenever I listen to Joanna Newsom. Her music transcends silly things like temporary bonds.</p>

<p>Most of the songs I love, Joanna would probably never play live again (okay, I really just want to hear <em>Only Skin</em> which is a 16-minute epic) but it would definitely be cool to see her live. She doesn&rsquo;t do concert DVDs (as far as I can see) so most live footage I&rsquo;ve seen have been shitty fan videos. I would want to hear harp live in action.</p>

<h3 id="green-day">Green Day</h3>

<p>This one is a little silly. I haven&rsquo;t really <em>loved</em> Green Day in years. A lot of their songs have aged even if I do enjoy them from time to time. But I want to fulfill 12 year old me&rsquo;s dream of seeing them in concert. I think it would definitely be a fun experience, they can put on a show.</p>

<h3 id="who-would-i-not-see-live">Who Would I Not See Live?</h3>

<p>I looked at my top artists on Last.fm and there are a couple of musicians who I love dearly but would probably be okay with not seeing them live.</p>

<p><strong>DIR EN GREY</strong> is definitely one of those bands. While their music is banging, I&rsquo;ve never liked watching their performances. If I had the chance to see them, I would do it but it&rsquo;s definitely not pressing.</p>

<p><strong>Utada Hikaru</strong> is another artist. I love her but she is definitely a studio artist and not really great at performing. Her voice is a bit weak and it doesn&rsquo;t translate to great concerts. <strong>The Strokes</strong> is a band I wouldn&rsquo;t see for a similar reason. Their concerts always seem really lacking in energy. Julian Casablancas has a great voice regardless but they&rsquo;re usually just&hellip; Standing around on stage and engaging at all. They never seem like they&rsquo;re having fun.</p>

<p>My friend asked me to go see <strong>Thrice</strong> with him this February (I said no, mostly because he lives all the way in Australia). It would be a lot of fun to see Thrice but I&rsquo;m not that dedicated of a fan to do so. I only really like one of their albums. I don&rsquo;t know much of their discography.</p>

<p>That being said, even if I wouldn&rsquo;t go out of my way to see these artists live (I would fly to Japan to see L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel if I have to), I would totally go see them if it wasn&rsquo;t a hassle. Concerts are a lot of fun, even if you don&rsquo;t really know the band well or at all. Here&rsquo;s to hoping for more concert going in the future!</p>

</div>


<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria</strong> (-)
Even though I&rsquo;ve been making a conscious decision to not listen to as much Coheed and Cambria, I&rsquo;m still listening to them quite a lot. They&rsquo;re too good!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Vitamin String Quartet</strong> (*)
This came totally left field. I was looking for <em>In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</em> on Spotify and then I found that this group covered the entire album. When I looked through their discography, they covered a lot of cool alternative/rock/indie bands from the early to mid 2000&rsquo;s and I went on a huge nostalgia trip. It&rsquo;s a shame they&rsquo;re only a quartet, I feel like a lot of the songs would have benefited from an entire orchestra. But yeah. Would recommend.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Green Day</strong> (+6)
I have so much Green Day in my library, I never really noticed. Lately I&rsquo;ve been putting my library on shuffle and just letting it ride out. Some songs don&rsquo;t have a lot of draw for me anymore. But similar to last week, I am still rocking out to those <em>American Idiot</em> and <em>Nimrod</em> tunes.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thrice</strong> (*)
Thrice is a long time favourite of mine. I saw one of my friends listening to them on Spotify one day and I just went back and listened to them on repeat for a couple of hours.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse</strong> (+2)
I don&rsquo;t know how I overlooked some of Amy&rsquo;s songs. I still need to listen to her discography.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>My Chemical Romance</strong> (*)
This is another case of putting my library on shuffle, I feel. I have so much My Chemical Romance. I&rsquo;m like 99% sure I have their entire discography, bar B-sides and demos and concert versions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Eminem</strong> (*)
This week has just been pure nostalgia. With <em>Kamikaze</em> coming out, I went on Spotify and saved all the Eminem songs I listened to back in the day. A lot of them from <em>Encore</em>. This was another case of library shuffle and the Spotify algorithm probably picking more Eminem songs because he&rsquo;s popular.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Alexisonfire</strong> (*)
More nostalgia and more library shuffle! I didn&rsquo;t notice a lot of Alexisonfire this week. But I do recall rocking out to <em>We Are the Sound</em> a couple of times whenever it came on. It&rsquo;s hard not to.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joanna Newsom</strong> (*)
The nostalgia trip never ends. It&rsquo;s a shame that Joanna doesn&rsquo;t put her music on Spotify. I have most of her discography anyway (<em>Divers</em> was the last album I bought) and I can listen to it offline on Spotify but it&rsquo;s still a barrier.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mashrou&rsquo; Leila</strong> (*)
Wow, more nostalgia. Mashrou&rsquo; Leila is definitely more recent in my music history but I haven&rsquo;t picked them up in a couple of months and I totally forgot how they have a bunch of great bops.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures</strong> (-)
I told myself not to overplay this album but I just can&rsquo;t stay away from it. It&rsquo;s a little weird how no tracks made it into my top 10 songs for this week but that might be a good thing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension</strong> (+1)
<em>Domino</em> never gets old for me. Every time I listen to it, I can see the music video play so clearly in my head.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thrice — Vheissu</strong> (*)
<em>Vheissu</em> is easily my number one or number two favourite album of all time. There is no track in this album that I don&rsquo;t like or will ever skip. It&rsquo;s great from start to finish.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse — Back to Black</strong> (+2)
Not much to say about this one. Just been listening to a couple of tracks on repeat.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</strong> (-3)
Definitely slowly winding down on the Coheed. Mostly just listening to <em>A Favor House Atlantic</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I&rsquo;m Burning Star IV: Volume 1</strong> (-2)
Why is this album so good? Like, seriously. So many good songs on this album. But, still toning it down with the Coheed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joanna Newsom — Ys</strong> (*)
The only reason why <em>Vheissu</em> might be number two instead of number one is because of this album. I love this album. I think it is probably Joanna&rsquo;s best album. It is a beautifull crafted piece of art. I love it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I&rsquo;m Burning Star IV: Volume 2</strong> (*)
Was talking to my friend about a couple tracks from this album. It&rsquo;s pretty underrated, I&rsquo;m not sure why so many fans are &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Protest the Hero — Fortress</strong> (*)
I was looking for good study music but I didn&rsquo;t want like strings or lo-fi beats so I tried looking up metal/rock study music. Thank god Protest the Hero released instrumentals for their songs. Surprisingly, a lot of them definitely sound a lot less energetic without vocals. What a difference it makes!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Jeff Williams — RWBY Volume 1 Soundtrack</strong> (*)
RWBY Volume 1 has arguably the best soundtrack in the entire series. <em>This Will Be the Day</em>, <em>Gold</em>, <em>From Shadow</em>, <em>Mirror Mirror</em>, <em>Red Like Roses</em>, <em>I Burn</em>, <em>I May Fall</em>, <em>Wings</em>,&hellip; There are way too many good songs on it. The only song that I don&rsquo;t like from the soundtrack is probably <em>Red Like Roses Part II</em> (just kidding as I&rsquo;m writing this I&rsquo;m listening to it now and I like it).</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse — Tears Dry on Their Own</strong> (*)
<em>He walks away, the sun goes down, he takes the day but I&rsquo;m grown.</em> Oh Amy, thank you for gracing the world with your music. I really think this is a nice and hopeful song.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thank you Scientist — Feed the Horses</strong> (+7)
Wow, this song went up from last week. It&rsquo;s a good song but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why I keep listening to it as much as I have.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Domino the Destitute</strong> (-1)
This song is a banger. That is all.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — No World for Tomorrow</strong> (*)
Probably the best song off of the album. <em>Curse us, as god has.</em> Amazing. I would love to hear this song live one day. <em>There&rsquo;s no world for tomorrow, if we wait for today.</em> I remember talking about how <em>In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</em> made me feel like a soldier marching into battle, this definitely takes that concept and amps it up a hundred times.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kero Kero Bonito — Only Acting</strong> (-5)
Still a good song, just haven&rsquo;t been listening to it as much. Time to queue it up.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sharon Van Etten — A Crime</strong> (+1)
I hope I never grow tired of this song because it is beautiful.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — A Favor House Atlantic</strong> (-2)
The other day I looked up the music video for this song. It is so ridiculous but hilarious. They definitely take a jab at Green Day with Claudio dressing up in Billie Joe&rsquo;s trademark black button up and red tie, it&rsquo;s so funny.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Frank Carter &amp; The Rattlesnakes — Neon Rust</strong> (*)
I really need to listen to more of their songs because this is a really good song. I just love the atmosphere of the song. The melody in the beginning is really soothing and then it builds up to the chorus. It feels a little empty until the climax but it really releases all the tension in the song. So good.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK</strong> (-5)
Joji. Who hurt youuuuuuu??</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Crossing the Frame</strong> (*)
Good jam. <em>I&rsquo;m spying on you Newoooo.</em></p></li>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is not a concert review and this post contains swearing</p>

<p>One of the things on my <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/25-before-25/">25 before 25 bucket list</a> was to go see a concert. The last concert I went to when I made my bucket list was the Japanese band <em>Lix</em> at an anime convention back in 2012 (but that slipped my mind when I wrote it and I said the last concert I went to was a <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/my-chemical-romance-in-concert/">My Chemical Romance concert</a>). Technically I already fulfilled this earlier in the year when I saw a video game cover band at the same anime convention but for some reason I don&rsquo;t really count that as a real concert.</p>

<p>However, this month I saw a bunch of concerts thanks to the Calgary Stampede&rsquo;s Coca-Cola Stage. Every year my city hosts a stage where musicians perform at for 10 days. Usually I skip out on it because I don&rsquo;t like any of the musicians that attend. However, this year they came out with the news that the bands Alexisonfire and Billy Talent were coming and I knew that I just had to go.</p>

<h2 id="alexisonfire">Alexisonfire</h2>

<p>I watched a lot of <em>Much Music</em> on TV as a kid, which is essentially Canada&rsquo;s equivalent of MTV. What I really liked about <em>Much Music</em> was that they featured a lot of Canadian artists and a lot of bands. I&rsquo;ve always been a rocker at heart and I was so glad that they were diverse and played bands alongside the more mainstream pop musicians. Now that I think about it, the mid/late 2000&rsquo;s seemed like a better time for bands but that&rsquo;s beside the point.</p>

<p>Every week there would be a countdown of that week&rsquo;s hits. Back in 2006, I distinctly remember watching Alexisonfire climbing the charts all the way up to number one with their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPcds3jOhRQ"><em>This Could be Anywhere in the World</em></a>. I tried to listen to their previous works but back then I had very little tolerance to screaming in songs and their newer songs were more melodic. Most of the songs that I liked by Alexisonfire was from their <em>Crisis</em> album.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2015 that I delved into their discography again. They somehow got on my recommended on YouTube and I was hit by nostalgia. My taste in music had definitely changed since 2006 and I found a new appreciation for both the screaming vocals and the clean vocals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of all the music I&rsquo;ve been listening to since the end of 2010 and you can really see that sudden 2015 spike. I was riding the Alexisonfire phase until about 2017. I think I would attribute the 2018 spike to the news that Alexisonfire was coming to my city, where I was just hyping myself up for my favourite songs and listening to more of their discography just in case they played any unfamiliar songs.</p>

<p>My friends and I ran up to the area where Alexisonfire was playing about an hour and a half before the concert started. I saw that they put up barriers pretty early. Initially I didn&rsquo;t know what the barriers were for but later I learned it was for keeping the mosh pit contained. So my friends and I were right up against the barrier before the crowd turned into the mosh pit section. We were fairly close to the stage but not quite enough for my short self to see past the sea of tall people.</p>

<p>That didn&rsquo;t matter too much to me. What I really came to hear was the music. I also really wanted to see George Petit (the screaming vocalist) in the flesh at least once.</p>

<p>They ended up playing a lot of my favourite songs (except for maybe two or three). They started off with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8nIv56qKhM"><em>Young Cardinals</em></a> which kicked things off really well. It was great whenever they handed off the singing to the crowd. It gave me goosebumps listening to everyone around me and barely myself singing along. It just got me hyped. Next, they did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgkMlEn8L2E"><em>Boiled Frogs</em></a>. This is one of my favourite singles from 2006.</p>

<p>One of George&rsquo;s strong points is hyping up the crowd. When they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6SK3CrVWko"><em>We Are the Sound</em></a> I screamed my heart out whenever George prompted the crowd to, &ldquo;repeat after me!&rdquo; Another example is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=993hs8m1J40"><em>Dog&rsquo;s Blood</em></a>, which isn&rsquo;t one of my favourite songs ever. I was reading people&rsquo;s comments about the concert after and one poster said at one point in the song, they learned over to their girlfriend and said to her, &ldquo;After this, George will say &lsquo;<em>Now fuck this place up</em>!&lsquo;&rdquo; He says that in every performance of <em>Dog&rsquo;s Blood</em> but I don&rsquo;t care, it&rsquo;s fucking hype anyway!</p>

<p>There were a couple of songs that they played that I wasn&rsquo;t too familiar with (<em>Crisis</em>, <em>Accept Crime</em>, <em>Drunks, Lovers, Sinners and Saints</em>) but those were still really great songs to just headbang and groove to.</p>

<p>Of course, they played <em>This Could Be Anywhere in the World</em> as their &ldquo;last&rdquo; song. It was absolutely amazing. That&rsquo;s hands down their most well-known song. The girl to my left was really quiet the entire concert but once this song started, she was just all into it. That&rsquo;s one of my favourite things about concerts: when everyone is just freaking out over really good songs by a really good band that they all love.</p>

<p>The encore was what got me the most though. Most notably, they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwXSwbX_NqI"><em>Pulmonary Archery</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ0Zncg7sLQ"><em>Accidents</em></a>. When I heard the opening riff of <em>Accidents</em>, I yelled &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; and threw my hand in the air. I don&rsquo;t know the lyrics to <em>Accidents</em> really well but I screamed my heart out to what I thought Dallas Green was singing. Right now I&rsquo;m listening to the song and just reliving it. I screamed &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s redefine&rdquo; so hard my throat started to hurt. That was the absolute highlight of the concert for me.</p>

<p>Even weeks later, I&rsquo;m still a little bit in a daze of seeing Alexisonfire live. I got to see George Petit&rsquo;s head pop a couple of times and saw him tear off his shirt. I saw Chris Steele briefly go across the stage deliriously. I witnessed a dude in a wheelchair crowd surfing. Wade McNeil yelled at some crowd surfer blocking the view of the stage and cemented the fact that he is probably the coolest and kindest dude in the band. It was just a whole lot of fun. I am still so extremely happy that I got to see them live.</p>

<h2 id="billy-talent">Billy Talent</h2>

<p>Billy Talent is a bit of a different story. At first I was a little bit hesitant to see Billy Talent because I&rsquo;m not a big Billy Talent fan. I also got into Billy Talent in 2006 so they still had a bit of a nostalgia factor to me. 2006 was when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv5kkI5X1QM">*Devil in a Midnight Mass</a> came out and I really liked that song. They came out with a lot of singles off their 2006 album <em>Billy Talent II</em> that I really liked. I also liked the singles off their previous self-titled <em>Billy Talent</em> album. However after that, Billy Talent fell off my radar and I just listened to those singles over and over again.</p>

<p>2006 was right around that middle school age and that was when I was probably at my edgiest. Billy Talent had a lot of relatable songs that are comparable to Linkin Park&rsquo;s songs in their hay day. That was a big reason why I was drawn to Billy Talent. I could emotionally connect to a lot of their songs.</p>

<p>You can see that in 2016 I only listened to two songs by Billy Talent. In 2016, Billy Talent came out with the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-3Ms3m34"><em>Afraid of Heights</em></a> and I decided to give it a listen. Evidently I didn&rsquo;t like it that much back then because I only listened to it once and to one other song from the album.</p>

<p>When I learned that Billy Talent was coming to Calgary, I decided to try to listen to more of their songs. I eventually grew to like <em>Afraid of Heights</em> and I rediscovered <strong>a lot</strong> of Billy Talent songs I used to love when I was younger.</p>

<p><strong>Compared to Alexisonfire</strong></p>

<p>For the first four years, I listened to just slightly more Billy Talent compared to Alexisonfire. I think this is because there were more songs I liked by Billy Talent. When it came to Alexisonfire, I only liked a couple of songs, maybe four at the most, but I played them a lot. Of course, 2015 changed how I listened to Alexisonfire.</p>

<p>2014 or 2015 was around when I started to use Spotify so I was listening less and less to my personal music library. I essentially rebuilt my music library from scratch through the Spotify catalogue. Billy Talent did not make the cut but Alexisonfire did.</p>

<p>Obviously, in 2018 pre and post-concert I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of Billy Talent. Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll be listening to Billy Talent more than Alexisonfire in the future.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much from the concert because I never saw myself as a big fan of Billy Talent. But I was <em>amazed</em> at how many songs I recognized at the concert. They played some of my favourite classics like <em>Devil in a Midnight Mass</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lc-mkZXPao"><em>The Ex</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPCMx8yS7c0"><em>Try Honesty</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8zR30qTd8Y"><em>River Below</em></a>. They also played some recent songs that I didn&rsquo;t really know but liked enough to headbang to.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNhPb_BPfLA"><em>This is How it Goes</em></a> is one of those songs that wasn&rsquo;t familiar with but when they played it, I just lost myself to the music. Later I found out this song was written after the drummer, Aaron Solowoniuk, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The song had a good amount of &ldquo;fuck it, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck anymore&rdquo; that resonated with me.</p>

<p>The encore was the real banger though. I can get why bands save the really good songs for the encore but damn. I am <em>so</em> happy they played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2UktJtKpFw"><em>Red Flag</em></a>. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it but they did it! I screamed out the chorus every single time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg63uxYwN0"><em>Fallen Leaves</em></a> is another one of my favourites. I never saw it as a show closer but oh man, now I understand why they ended it with that song. It has a similar sentiment to Alexisonfire&rsquo;s <em>This Could be Anywhere in the World</em>, of being disgruntled about the place you currently live in and seeing nothing but corruption everywhere.</p>

<p>Ben, the vocalist for Billy Talent, made a really great effort to connect to the crowd. Like Alexisonfire, they commented about coming back to Calgary after so many years which was really nice to hear. Also similar to Alexisonfire, Ben stressed about being inclusive to everyone and had a spiel about loving everyone no matter their background.</p>

<p>Something that was pretty cool was that one of the sound technicians had a birthday that day and Ben passed a cake through the crowd from the front of the stage back to where the sound booth was. My friends and I watched the cake float through the crowd. One time the cake almost fell. I&rsquo;m glad the band trusted us with that cake.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an awesome concert. I screamed a lot more at that concert than the Alexisonfire concert, partly because Billy Talent songs are a lot more singable for someone who can&rsquo;t do screamo vocals. I feel a little unfair for comparing this concert to the Alexisonfire concert (one of my friends said he heard someone else talking about how &ldquo;Alexisonfire had way more people than this&rdquo;) especially when the two bands have the same touring drummer, Jordan Hastings. But these two bands were both prominent in my early life right around the same time. They really defined the Canadian rock landscape in the early/mid-2000&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s amazing that they can still draw huge crowds and are (in Billy Talent&rsquo;s case) making new music.</p>

<p>In the end, I enjoyed Billy Talent and Alexisonfire for different reasons. My junior high self would have loved seeing Billy Talent live. My current self is just so glad I got to see Alexisonfire. I am still grateful that I got to see both of them. I will hopefully never stop listening to these two bands. I think I will always be able to listen to my favourite songs and rock out to them.</p>
