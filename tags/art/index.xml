      <description>My SO suggested we start a weekly drawing. So we pick a picture of something to draw and at the end of the week we share it. Last week we drew elephants.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my elephant! I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick to pencil drawings. I&amp;rsquo;m not good at drawing by any means and this was pretty easy, honestly. It was fun drawing it though!

Versus what I was trying to draw&amp;#8230; I see clearly what I should have done differently now, haha.</description>
