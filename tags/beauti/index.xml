      <description>My skool is posted on a band&amp;rsquo;s website! That&amp;rsquo;s never happened before. In the picture, the first school listed is my school. It was career day today and the day ended with the Absolute Presentation. I remember the presentation form last year. Last year was better but mainly because the band was better (Colin Lingren is amazing). But apparently the band that came to our school was better in terms of success.</description>

      <description>Beauti is a pretty good band. Right now, they&amp;rsquo;re on tour with this thing called Absolute. They travel all across Canada to high schools. Which really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense because I&amp;rsquo;m in junior high. Anyway, they played four songs (actually three, but they played one song while the kids went into the gym). I forget what one song was, but the two songs they played was Forever Love, and Don&amp;rsquo;t Watch Me.</description>
