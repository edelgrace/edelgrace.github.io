 Do you sneak a peek at the number of views your posts have gotten?
 Nope! I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone except for my friends reads my blog or people who somehow stumble upon on my blog from Google. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care that much about view count.</description>

 Do you like to finish one book before starting the next or do you read several at once?
 I&amp;rsquo;m notorious for reading several books at once but eventually it turns into reading one book at a time. I have a ton of books I&amp;rsquo;ve started only to drop for another book instead.</description>

 What author do you not read and why?
 Right off the top of my head, I don&amp;rsquo;t read Jodi Picoult anymore. I used to really like Jodi Picoult after reading My Sister&amp;rsquo;s Keeper and I went on a binge just reading work after work.</description>

 Have you ever visited the location of a book you have read?

 Do you have a YouTube channel? If so, do you post book review vlogs?
 I technically have a YouTube channel. It&amp;rsquo;s more a hub for past course projects. I don&amp;rsquo;t post any videos on it. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would ever do book review vlogs.</description>

 Where do you post your reviews besides your blog? Please list them all so perhaps we can find some new sites.

 Do you follow other book blogs and if so, who are your top 3 bloggers?
 Not really. I follow a blog that does book reviews ocassionally but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say they are a book blog.
Jane at Janepedia is that blog.</description>

 Can you say this about yourself? Nothing makes me happier than sitting down with a good book.
 Not even close.
Some things that make as happy or happier:
 Eating really good food Having a meaningful conversation with a friend Sitting in the field in my father&amp;rsquo;s homeland looking up a starry sky Listening to a good song in the window seat of a train watching the city pass by Playing a video game and being absorbed in a virtual world Falling asleep to the sound of rain Singing along to my favourite songs Watching a good TV series that can make me sob Walking along the river on a sunny day Going to a concert Playing with really cute babies Dog spotting around the city Etc.</description>

 Do you agree or disagree with this statement: A blogger&amp;rsquo;s first name should be in a prominent place on his/her blog.
 I definitely agree! Even if the name is an alias, putting a name to the blog can do wonders in making a blog feel more personable.</description>

 What&amp;rsquo;s your proudest blogging milestone or achievement?
 I think the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blog for so long is an achievement. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging since 2007, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for over ten years now. I remember blogging on a platform called Mibba.</description>

 Does a cluttered blog have you not returning? By cluttered I mean too many columns, small type, too many photos, difficult to follow, etc.
 Interestingly, I rarely visit blogs anymore. I only ever really visit a blog when a blog I am subscribed to pops up on my RSS reader and I feel compelled to comment on it.</description>

 If you were stranded on a deserted island, which ONE book could you not live without?
 OH MAN. This is such a hard question. Would I bring my favourite book, Vilette by Charlotte Brontë? I&amp;rsquo;ve only read it once, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I could read it more than a couple of times.</description>

 I do have an Instagram account! Shameless plug, @edelgraceme.
The people I follow are usually my friends. Sometimes I follow some comic artists because I enjoy some humor every now and then.</description>

 What author have you read the most in the past two years?
 Not including manga artists, that would by Ursula K. Le Guin.
I just happened to come across Le Guin by chance. I was itching to read some sci-fi but I was daunted by all the thick hardcover volumes at my local library.</description>

 What were your worst movies based off of books?
 WARNING: Spoilers for My Sister&amp;rsquo;s Keeper by Jodi Picoult.
When I go to see a movie based off a book, I don&amp;rsquo;t go in with high expectations. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Harry Potter nerd by any stretch of imagination so those movies didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me despite their departures from the source material.</description>

 Do you read hardcovers with the dust jacket on or off? Why or why not?
 Sometimes, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice. A good number of books I read are from the library. If a hardcover has a dust jacket, it&amp;rsquo;s gauranteed that the dust jacket is taped to the covers.</description>

 Have you ever found yourself acting like a favorite character in a novel? If so, which one?
