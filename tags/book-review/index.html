<blockquote>
<p>There are 168 hours in a week. This is your guide to getting the most out of them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an unquestioned truth of modern life: we are starved for time. We tell ourselves we&rsquo;d like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren&rsquo;t enough hours to do it all. Or if we don&rsquo;t make excuses, we make sacrifices- taking time out from other things in order to fit it all in.</p>

<p>There has to be a better way&hellip;and Laura Vanderkam has found one. After interviewing dozens of successful, happy people, she realized that they allocate their time differently than most of us. Instead of letting the daily grind crowd out the important stuff, they start by making sure there&rsquo;s time for the important stuff. When plans go wrong and they run out of time, only their lesser priorities suffer.</p>

<p>Vanderkam shows that with a little examination and prioritizing, you&rsquo;ll find it is possible to sleep eight hours a night, exercise five days a week, take piano lessons, and write a novel without giving up quality time for work, family, and other things that really matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Save your hours and don&rsquo;t read this book. I am sure there are better time management books out there.</p>

<p>This was an absolute dull and boring read. I ended up skimming through the book after the second chapter, just keeping out for bolded words and headings. Thank goodness Laura made her book skimmable. I have no idea why so many &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; books insist on being about 100 pages longer than they should be. So let&rsquo;s get this review out of the way.</p>

<p>I did, however, do the exercise to keep a log of what you do for a week and that was pretty fun. I will be posting results sometime soon!</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<ul>
<li>Log what you do every day for an entire week at 15-minute increments to find out what you <em>really</em> spend your week doing</li>
<li>Find something that you can do in 30 minutes (or less) whenever you find yourself with 30 minutes of time</li>
<li>Spend more quality time with your kids (I have no kids but I agree, parents should spend time with their kids)</li>
<li>Interactive activities and questions to fill out</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-meh">The Meh</h3>

<ul>
<li>Find out your core competencies and improve on them</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do what you love as a career!</li>
<li>Hire someone to do your laundry, cleaning, etc.!</li>
<li>Hire an assistant! Since I&rsquo;m a programmer, does that mean I should just hire someone to program for me??</li>
<li>Better yet, just don&rsquo;t clean as much! You don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> need a spotless house</li>
<li>Watch less TV! I already don&rsquo;t watch TV</li>
<li>Cooking is a waste of time, just buy a ton of processed food</li>
<li>Who needs <em>knitting</em>? (I take much offense because I love knitting and crafts)</li>
<li>Random sentences were thrown in about religion (you do you, Laura, but don&rsquo;t me what to believe in kthxbai)</li>
<li>Soooo many anecdotes. I don&rsquo;t care, I just want the advice!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> was the first novel to split the atom. If the novel before <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> aspired to immensities of scope and scale, to heroic journeys across vast landscapes, with <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> Virginia Woolf insisted that it could also locate the enormous within the everyday; that a life of errands and party-giving was every bit as viable a subject as any life lived anywhere; and that should any human act in any novel seem unimportant, it has merely been inadequately observed. The novel as an art form has not been the same since.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I picked up <em>The Hours</em> one day at the library. I did not know what it was about when I started reading it, and it captured me immediately. The scene of Woolf at the water&rsquo;s edge, the stones in her pocket, made my heart drop. As I read on, I realized this was, essentially, a crossover with <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>. I hadn&rsquo;t read <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> yet. So, even though I loved <em>The Hours</em> up to that point, I put it down so as not to spoil myself.</p>

<p>Finally, years later, I finished <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>.</p>

<p>This was a hard book to read. I actually had gotten a copy of the audiobook from Audible (no, this post is not sponsored by Audible) and while listening to it, I knew I could not <strong>just</strong> listen to it, I needed to devour these words on a page. I put out a hold on the book at the library and eagerly started reading right away. However, it was incredibly hard for me to read. I would read a paragraph and not know what exactly was happening.</p>

<p>Annette Brownings, the narrator of the audiobook, breathed so much life into Woolf&rsquo;s words that I ended up listening to the audiobook while I read the physical book. That could be why it took me so long to read this book. But it was a very interesting way to read it. I find that when I listen to audiobooks, my mind can tend to wander. While reading, sometimes I will have to reread sentences before they make sense. Reading and listening at the same time really anchored me and I was able to focus.</p>

<p>And it was great that I was able to focus on it. The characters in <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> absolutely grabbed me. I have never loved a cast of characters more. They are all so inexplicably human. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to grow old as I&rsquo;m still pretty young but I could <strong>feel</strong> these things that the characters went through, were going through.</p>

<p>Woolf has a wonderful way of narrating, it seems a lot like casual conversation. Quirky enough that you could spot a Woolf novel a mile away. I adored it, plain and simple (I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s one of her quirky isms and I&rsquo;m taking it!). Woolf understands life. She suffered through it. I am so glad that she left the world with her words for us to muse and contemplate over. How intriguing it is, how one can leave behind a legacy.</p>

<p><em>If anybody could have saved me it would have been you.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ligget was precisely the sort of person who, if he hadn&rsquo;t married Emily, would be just the perfect person for Emily to snub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book captivated me. From the moment Gloria stepped on to the page, I was hooked. This young and feisty woman is surprisingly progressive for her time: sleeping around, smoking, staying up all hours of the night. She is your classic bad girl whom everyone has their eyes set upon her. Of course, this only ends in tragedy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a hopeless romantic so there is one scene in the entire book that stuck out the most Gloria and Eddie, two close friends, are on the verge of sleeping together. They are probably the most suited together out of all the possible combinations of Gloria and other men. Then, at that moment, Gloria sees Eddie as just another man who wants to get into her pants. Suddenly, the magic is lost. I find it tragic.</p>

<p>Gloria throws herself at men and declares love for men in a way that I totally do not understand. She says she would marry Ligget but I don&rsquo;t see the attraction or at least any evidence that Gloria would have any attraction to such a prospect. Does she just want to be comfortable with a somewhat wealthy man even if he&rsquo;s twice her age? On the other hand, Ligget is so weirdly obsessed with Gloria for what seems like just because she is young and daring and it&rsquo;s frankly tiring.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;m complaining, this makes for such a good story. I wanted to know everything. The ending was a bit disappointing but kudos for not making me see it coming until two paragraphs before. It&rsquo;s tragic.</p>

<p>Also, don&rsquo;t be fooled by Gloria being ahead of her time. This book is still a product of its time. It&rsquo;s rife with sexism and blatant racism. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if this was a modern take on the post-Depression era but the lack of sugarcoating on these things and the authenticity of the characters made me realize that O&rsquo;Hara is definitely from this time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is but American literature from the 30&rsquo;s/40&rsquo;s have a very golden-like quality to them. I can feel the hazy smoke in the bars, hear the jazzy swing music, see the dated cars. It&rsquo;s definitely such a prominent aesthetic that you just inherently know even if those things aren&rsquo;t all explicitly detailed.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d say I enjoyed this book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The suburbs of north London are an unlikely spot from which to witness the total breakdown of society, and yet in 1897-8 that is what happened—at least in the imagination of H.G. Wells. In <em>The War of the Worlds</em> Martians lands in Woking, and then make their way remorselessly towards the capital, wreaking chaos, death, and destruction. The novel echoes anxieties about a possible invasion of Great Britain at the turn of the century, and growing concerns about imperial expansion and its impact, while drawing on the latest astronomical knowledge to imagine a desert planet, Mars, turning to Earth for its future. The Martians are evolutionarily superior to mankind, and the fate of civilization remains in doubt until the final pages. Disturbingly realistic and peopled with believable characters, the novel exemplifies the mixture of scientific scepticism and vivid imagination that made Wells the father of modern science fiction.</p>

<p>This new edition and introduction examines the literary and social climate in which Wells wrote and lived, and contains notes on contemporary geographical and cultural references.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book was a pleasant surprise. I did not know what to expect from this book as I&rsquo;ve never watched the movie. What surprised me the most was how long ago this was written. It was written in the late 1800&rsquo;s. I never realized that. Growing up, I always thought this was written in the 30&rsquo;s or something like that. This just astounds me. It&rsquo;s incredible to me to think that H.G. Wells had so much imagination in the 1800&rsquo;s to think of such a story. Admittedly, I don&rsquo;t know how prevelant the concept of aliens are.</p>

<p>What really intrigued me about this book was how it ended. These huge giant Martian monsters are wiped out only due to their own biology not being able to cope with Earth&rsquo;s environment. I never saw that coming. When I think about it, it would be totally plausible. What I&rsquo;m surprised at is how the reverse didn&rsquo;t happen as well. Think about all the different bacteria and viruses on Mars!</p>

<p>Everything else about this book is very typical science fiction. Of course, there is the scene where a man loses his mind during the apocalypse. People are largely in disbelief during the onset of the invasion. Masses killings. The military trying their best and pretty much failing at killing aliens.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say this fell flat for me but it was a pretty average book. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the significance of it is lost on me. I can imagine this made a big splash back then. And H.G. Wells is a very good writer. Definitely worthy of being a classic!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love as sickness and immorality, sex as entrapment and revenge—these are the themes that the Nobel Prize-winning author of <em>Snow Country</em> dramatizes with such coolly mesmerizing power in this novel. At its heart is is a destructive love affair between a married writer and a teenage girl that continues to haunt both of them more than twenty years after their last embrace—and whose lingering bitterness poisons everyone around them.</p>

<p>What begins as a sentimental reunion between the aging Oki Toshio and the reclusive artist Otoko Ueno escalates into a sinister erotic vendetta. For Keiko, the strange, intense young girl who is Otoko&rsquo;s protegee and lover, is determined to avenge the older woman&rsquo;s past humiliation—even if that means using her own beauty as a weapon. Shifting unpredictably between tenderness and obsession, serenity and savagery, <em>Beauty and Sadness</em> confirms Kawabata&rsquo;s reputation as a modern Japanese master who can turn the tightening of an <em>obi</em> into something infinitely suggestive and perverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kawabata haunts me. How apt, considering by the time this blog post is published, it&rsquo;s nearly Hallowe&rsquo;en.</p>

<p>This is the third Kawabata book that I&rsquo;ve read. I just keep coming back for more. Every time I find myself in the library, I wander over to the &ldquo;K&rdquo; authors and see if there&rsquo;s anything there by Kawabata.</p>

<p>There is a pattern in Kawabata&rsquo;s works. His characters are largely unlikeable and one-dimensional, especially the protagonist. What is with Kawabata and writing useless men as protagonists? Because Oki is the most boring and dull protagonist.</p>

<p>Kawabata, however, redeems himself in his prose. Even with these heavily flawed characters, Kawabata manages to make me feel these character&rsquo;s struggles and I can sympathize with them because he can portray them so well.</p>

<p>Concerning the controversial subject matter, I did not read the summary before reading this book. When it was revealed that Oki was a 30-something-year-old man and Otoko was just 16 when their affair started, I was startled. I don&rsquo;t want to say Kawabata doesn&rsquo;t make a big deal about it because he does. The book essentially revolves around the messy aftermath of Otoko and Oki&rsquo;s relationship.</p>

<p>Otoko is undeniably broken after. She miscarriages with Oki&rsquo;s child and is sent to a mental institution. She becomes a successful painter and begins a relationship with a young woman (girl? I don&rsquo;t know how old she is) named Keiko. In many ways, this relationship mirrors Otoko&rsquo;s relationship with Oki.</p>

<p>In a way, Kawabata forces you to accept the fact that Oki had done this to Otoko. He does romanticize it too much for my comfort (Otoko continues to pine over Oki even twenty years later despite all he put her through) but he does not neglect to show how harmful the relationship was.</p>

<p>Keiko is the character who realizes how despicable Oki is and she tries to get revenge. I was torn in a couple places. Even though Keiko claims to want revenge against Oki, I felt like Keiko was really getting revenge on Otoko. I think, deep down, Keiko knew that Otoko did not love Keiko or did not love her as deeply as she did Oki.</p>

<p>Honestly, Keiko is the weakest point in the story for me. I did not care for her one bit. I saw the ending coming a mile away. Keiko and Oki&rsquo;s son go out for a boat ride. Oki&rsquo;s son presumably drowns but Keiko lives. I can&rsquo;t help but feel Keiko was malicious enough to plan it out. It was the highest form of revenge. Otoko has her own child taken away from her. Oki must feel the same pain as well.</p>

<p>Overall, not Kawabata&rsquo;s strongest. But I relish these melodramatic, melancholic, love-stricken stories of his.</p>
