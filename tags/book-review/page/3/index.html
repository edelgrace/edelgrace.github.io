<blockquote>
<p>To many readers, who have perhaps known Frankenstein only at second hand, the original may well come as a surprise. When Mary Shelley began it, she was only eighteen, though she was already Shelley&rsquo;s mistress and Byron&rsquo;s friend. In her preface she explains how she and Shelley spent part of a wet summer with Byron in Switzerland, amusing themselves by reading and writing ghost stories. Her contribution was Frankenstein, a story about a student of natural philosophy who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from bones he has collected in charnel-houses. The story is not a study of the macabre, as such, but rather a study of how man uses his power, through science, to manipulate and pervert his own destiny, and this makes it a profoundly disturbing book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shelley is a lot like her mother. They both love characters who talk and talk and talk.</p>

<p>Honestly, I did not expect most of what happened in this book. Everyone &ldquo;knows&rdquo; the Frankenstein story: mad scientist raises the undead in a creepy laboratory in the mountains during a thunderstorm. It usually seems to end there. Some variations, Frankenstein actually makes a &ldquo;female&rdquo; version and, usually, the female doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with its male counterpart.</p>

<p>However, I learned that Frankenstein is much more than that. It&rsquo;s a lot more gruesome and morbid than I thought it would be. I wouldn&rsquo;t really classify it as horrifying in any way. Honestly, I was a bit bored by many parts of it. I sympathized with Frankenstein&rsquo;s creation when he told his tale but it was still hard for me to picture him as anything but human.</p>

<p>I will say that I enjoyed how Shelley utilized the unreliable narrator. I can&rsquo;t believe sitting down with someone while they recounted a story as long as this.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I read it and got it out of the way but I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the book itself. I don&rsquo;t want to say &ldquo;it was okay&rdquo; AKA 2 stars because that implies there was something good about the book. Not to say there&rsquo;s anything bad but it just wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nine Island is an intimate autobiographical novel, told by J, a woman who lives in a glass tower on one of Miami Beach’s lush Venetian Islands. After decades of disaster with men, she is trying to decide whether to withdraw forever from romantic love. Having just returned to Miami from a monthlong reunion with an old flame, “Sir Gold,” and a visit to her fragile mother, J begins translating Ovid’s magical stories about the transformations caused by Eros. “A woman who wants, a man who wants nothing. These two have stalked the world for thousands of years,” she thinks.</p>

<p>When not ruminating over her sexual past and current fantasies, in the company of only her aging cat, J observes the comic, sometimes steamy goings-on among her faded-glamour condo neighbors. One of them, a caring nurse, befriends her, eventually offering the opinion that “if you retire from love&#8230; then you retire from life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m a 22 year old who has had thoughts about giving up on love. Of course, this book intrigued me. What would a middle aged woman&rsquo;s life be like alone and loveless? The protagonist, J, tries to sort out exactly what she wants in life after getting divorced and rekindling an old flame that ultimately went nowhere. At first her cat, mother, and neighbours seem to sustain her. But the past is always creeping up in the back of her mind. When is it okay to give up on love? One of the main characters profoundly remarks, &ldquo;To retire from love is to retire from life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This book has given me a lot of food for thought. I hoped to gain some insights but I don&rsquo;t feel any less confused or more confused after reading it. There seems to be a lot going towards trying to find love. I expressed my feelings of becoming a cat lady to a friend and she replied with, &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s going to take care of you when you&rsquo;re old? If you die, your cats will just eat you.&rdquo; She has a point, which Alison also touched on in the book. Most people who have a family are usually taken care of by their children. Sure, I could admit myself to a retirement home if I get that old but maybe it might be different if I had kids.</p>

<p>And as a human being with certain needs and urges, I thought that I could just, you know, take care of myself in that department when I&rsquo;m older and alone. Alison also addressed this. Ultimately, it really depends if you&rsquo;re okay with that and if you could sustain yourself that way. I think I could get by.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s also the loneliness factor. J focuses greatly on her work translating Ovid and her little side project of trying to save a duck. Her hobbies are a little off the wall but are they really hobbies or are they just distractions? I myself have a wealth of projects that should keep me busy and content but they don&rsquo;t always fill as much space as I would like them to sometimes.</p>

<p>Human contact is also a must which J gets no shortage of. Her neighbours, her cat, her past flings, and her mother are all social outlets that she utilizes. I&rsquo;ve entertained the idea of becoming a complete social recluse but I know that would not go out well. As much of an introvert that I (think I) am, I do enjoy being around people. I feel more human that way.</p>

<p>With all these thoughts swirling in my mind I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what to make of the arguments made in the book. There is really no hard conclusion that J comes to at the end. Maybe she&rsquo;ll stumble into love one day, maybe not. At the moment, she seems pretty okay with where her life is. So is the moral of the story to just go with the flow and take opportunities where they crop up? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>While I did focus a little too much on the content, it&rsquo;s not hard to notice that Alison&rsquo;s writing is absolutely dreamy. Her words float around you and bite at you with clever quips and wise insights. Her characters are all a little quirky and feel almost not real but it&rsquo;s not hard to believe people like these exist. I wish I could have slowed down a little bit more to absorb how well written this book was but I was too engrossed in the story.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed this book. I ate it up in two days after a reading dry spell. God, who knew Jane Austen could be so boring sometimes (I was in the process of reading <em>Northanger Abbey</em> at the time)? So this little novel was a good change of pace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more than four decades, Ursula K. Le Guin has enthralled readers with her imagination, clarity, and moral vision. The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, and five Hugo and five Nebula Awards, this renowned writer has, in each story and novel, created a provocative, ever-evolving universe filled with diverse worlds and rich characters reminiscent of our earthly selves.</p>

<p>Now, in <em>The Birthday of the World</em>, this gifted artist returns to these worlds in eight brilliant short works, including a never-before-published novella, each of which probes the essence of humanity. Here are stories that explore complex social interactions and troublesome issues of gender and sex; that define and defy notions of personal relationships and of society itself; that examine loyalty, survival, and introversion; that bring to light the vicissitudes of slavery and the meaning of transformation, religion, and history.</p>

<p>The first six tales in this spectacular volume are set in the author&rsquo;s signature world of the Ekumen, &ldquo;my pseudo-coherent universe with holes in the elbows,&rdquo; as Le Guin describes it — a world made familiar in her award-winning novel The Left Hand of Darkness. The seventh, title story was hailed by Publishers Weekly as &ldquo;remarkable &hellip; a standout.&rdquo; The final offering in the collection, Paradises Lost, is a mesmerizing novella of space exploration and the pursuit of happiness.In her foreword, Ursula K. Le Guin writes, &ldquo;to create difference-to establish strangeness-then to let the fiery arc of human emotion leap and close the gap: this acrobatics of the imagination fascinates and satisfies me as noother.&rdquo; In <em>The Birthday of the World</em>, this gifted literary acrobat exhibits a dazzling array of skills that will fascinate and satisfy us all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have found a new favourite author in Ursula K. Le Guin. I first read her work, &ldquo;A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&rdquo; which piqued my curiosity and I kept searching for her books until now. &ldquo;The Birthday of the World and Other Stories&rdquo; is not so different from the book I first read by this author. They are both collections of short stories and even feature some of the same planets. Somehow, I did not tire of the universe that Le Guin has created. There was always something new to learn about a planet or a species, even if I had already read about them before.</p>

<p>While her universe isn&rsquo;t as carefully crafted as one would think (her prologue discusses this), there is no denying the fact that her universe is extremely immersive. I could get lost in the lore and the people in it. Her characters, although many of them alien, are very understandable. Though their customs may be different, it was still generally easy to empathize with their specific alien problems. Everything is so believable and feels very real. Not once was I pulled out of my suspense of belief.</p>

<p>The stories were very memorable as well. Each culture was so distinct that I found it hard to mix up stories. I will admit that some of my favourite stories are the ones about the people of O and their complex relationship structures. However, my favourite story from this collection is without a doubt the very last story.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being a little bit egocentric because it&rsquo;s a story about us humans directly but I found it to be a very touching experience. I envy future generations who get to travel through space and I am always in awe of future generations learning about the past and how they would think of our current ways of thinking. Still, there&rsquo;s a relationship element in addition to all the nitty gritty sci fi that made my eyes water towards the end.</p>

<p>All in all, I would travel in Ursula K. le Guin&rsquo;s universes again. Her worlds are a world builders wet dream. Thank goodness I have found Ursula K. le Guin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have been awakened.</p>

<p>Floppy disk inserted, computer turned on, a whirring, and then this sentence, followed by a blinking cursor. So begins Suspended, the first computer game to obsess seven-year-old Michael, to worm into his head and change his sense of reality. Thirty years later he will write: &ldquo;Computer games have taught me the things you can&rsquo;t learn from people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gamelife is the memoir of a childhood transformed by technology. Afternoons spent gazing at pixelated maps and mazes train Michael&rsquo;s eyes for the uncanny side of 1980s suburban Illinois. A game about pirates yields clues to the drama of cafeteria politics and locker-room hazing. And in the year of his parents&rsquo; divorce, a spaceflight simulator opens a hole in reality.</p>

<p>In telling the story of his youth through seven computer games, Michael W. Clune captures the part of childhood we live alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m always intrigued about what people have to say about video games. What I find even more intriguing is how video games impact people&rsquo;s lives. More often than not, most video game memoirs (that I have read) involve the awkward geek entering into the beginning of the video game era. They find themselves or find a way out of themselves with this exciting new piece of technology by playing their way through <em>Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Michael Clune&rsquo;s <em>Gamelife</em> is no exception to this template. What unique offerings he has are in the form of metaphors and a somewhat serious video game addiction. At times, it feels like Clune&rsquo;s metaphors and observations are a bit of a stretch. It&rsquo;s almost like he tries to find meaning in something that doesn&rsquo;t have any meaning at all (i.e. <sky quote>). Other times, he&rsquo;s awfully poetic.</p>

<p>There were points where I assumed the role of his mother. I, too, worried about Clune&rsquo;s empty social life. But I also knew too well the unreasonably cruel ways that kids operated.</p>

<p>Okay, I didn&rsquo;t really. I had a good group of friends that I grew up with. However, I never felt as inside of the group as I thought I should be. Like Michael, I saw my friends faces close off mid-laugh and their eyes suddenly go distant the moment I opened my mouth.</p>

<p>I, also like Michael, retreated into the world of video games but of the much milder sort. My addiction was Runescape and Club Penguin. I&rsquo;d build endless camp fires, bake bread, and pretend to be a penguin spy. I wasn&rsquo;t like Clune&rsquo;s classmate Evan, who was true to himself no matter what character appeared on his screen. Even when I did name a character after myself, I always played as the person who I used to be.</p>

<p>It was observations like these, the ones where I found myself in them, that made me really appreciate this book. However there was something about Clune&rsquo;s style of narration that didn&rsquo;t jive with me. Perhaps, I disliked Clune&rsquo;s portrayal of himself. There was no redemption moment for Clune and no real moments of growth.</p>

<p>Would I recommend this to someone? Yeah, I think it has value. The main reason why I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this as much as I could have is probably a matter of preference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just in time for the 200th Anniversary, Manga Classics: Emma brings Jane Austen&rsquo;s classic tale of youthful folly and romantic exuberance to a modern audience with this beautiful, new manga adaptation. The impulsive match-making of Emma Woodhouse delivers both humor and heartache through the gorgeous artwork of manga-ka Po Tse (Manga Classics: Pride and Prejudice). &#8211; Manga Classics editions feature classic stories, faithfully adapted and illustrated in manga style, and available in both hardcover and softcover editions. Proudly presented by UDON Entertainment and Morpheus Publishing.</p>

<p>I enjoyed Jane Austen&rsquo;s <em>Emma</em> a great deal. After reading the novel, I proceeded to watch several movie adaptations. Each movie had a slightly different take on Emma but still stayed true to her character to the very core.</p>

<p>This rendition of Emma is not the greatest. Emma is been a haughty sort of character to me but somehow this adaptation made her seem almost unbearable. Unfortunately, from what I recall of the original novel, many of the lines are word for word so it would be unfair to pin it on the words she says when they are from Austen herself. Maybe the exaggerated body language in this medium portrayed Emma&rsquo;s character very poorly. Even Mrs. Elton seemed to be extremely over the top to put Emma in a better light and Mrs.Elton was already over the top to begin with.</p>

<p>In terms of art, I found it to be perfectly light and airy. Very suiting for a Victorian first-world problems drama. However the style is not in my tastes. I was also disappointed that it didn&rsquo;t seem to be all that historically accurate. Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s little goatee annoyed me but I will admit that I don&rsquo;t know if that was in vogue during that time. I wonder how much research went into the fashion of the times. I&rsquo;m not a fashion historian so my claims might be entirely wrong.</p>

<p>But, it was still a nice little read. It remained very true to the original and what more can an <em>Emma</em> fan ask for?</p>
