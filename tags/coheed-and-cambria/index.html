          <p>

<p>So this year I went to a bunch of concerts. Two of those concerts (<a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/thoughts-on-alexisonfire-and-billy-talent/">Alexisonfire</a> and <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/thoughts-on-coheed-and-cambria/">Coheed and Cambria</a>) were big wish listers for me and this got me thinking. What other artists do I want to see live?</p>

<h3 id="l-arc-en-ciel">L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel</h3>

<p>I know for sure that I want to see <strong>L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel</strong> live in concert. L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is a band I got into around junior high. Thanks to the power of the Internet, I know approximately the first time I fell in love with L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel. I used to watch anime all the time on YTV, one of the cartoon networks in Canada. They aired <em>Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa</em> on <strong>October 19, 2007</strong> where L&rsquo;Arc did two songs on the soundtrack and I loved them immediately.</p>

<p>I remember when L&rsquo;Arc performed in Madison Square Garden a couple of years ago, I was insanely jealous. I watched the footage, the concert reviews, the fan interviews and <strong>bawled my eyes out</strong>. Even now, the mere thought of the possibility of seeing L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel live in concert is bringing tears to my eyes. Actually, at this moment I&rsquo;m listening to their 25th Anniversary live disc and I&rsquo;m very emotional right now (yes, this is what spurred this post).</p>

<p>And a couple years ago, when they were planning their world tour they asked for suggestions for cities to go to and I spammed Canadian cities so hard. Of course, they never came. But I so desperately want to see them live one day.</p>

<p>L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is definitely a classic band for me. I remember making this post a like six years ago on Tumblr (god, remember all the confession tumblrs back then??). It&rsquo;s still true to this day.</p>

      <figcaption><h4>L&#39;Arc~en~Ciel is my one and only real favourite band, even though I&#39;ve gone through periods of not listening to them for months on end. They&#39;re the only band that I can come back to after a long time and listen to their songs as if I&#39;ve listen to it for the first time and love it with the same intensity as before</h4>

<p>I say &ldquo;I can die happy now&rdquo; after like every concert I&rsquo;ve been to but seeing L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel would be <em>the concert</em> that would actually make the statement true. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to see them for 11 years now. I hope to god L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel will continue touring until I can see them.</p>

<h3 id="björk">Björk</h3>

<p>One of my friends asked once me who my musical goddess was (no joke) and when I answered with <strong>Björk</strong> he was surprised. &ldquo;I thought it would be Beyonce,&rdquo; is what he replied. No offense to Beyonce (love her, she&rsquo;s amazing and empowering and makes great music) but she is definitely not on the level of artistry as Björk.</p>

<p>I remember watching TV in the dark late at night on MTV and Björk&rsquo;s <em>Bachelorette</em> came on. I was entranced. This big voice coming out of a rather small woman wearing jeans and what seemed like a dress. I listened to so much Björk ever since.</p>

<p>Admittedly, some of her latest music kinda flies over my head nowadays but what I would give to see her live in concert.</p>

<h3 id="joanna-newsom">Joanna Newsom</h3>

<p>Continuing the trend of amazing women musicians&hellip; Joanna Newsom. I would love to see her live as well. I remember my ex in high school was the one who introduced her to me. I thank god I never think about him whenever I listen to Joanna Newsom. Her music transcends silly things like temporary bonds.</p>

<p>Most of the songs I love, Joanna would probably never play live again (okay, I really just want to hear <em>Only Skin</em> which is a 16-minute epic) but it would definitely be cool to see her live. She doesn&rsquo;t do concert DVDs (as far as I can see) so most live footage I&rsquo;ve seen have been shitty fan videos. I would want to hear harp live in action.</p>

<h3 id="green-day">Green Day</h3>

<p>This one is a little silly. I haven&rsquo;t really <em>loved</em> Green Day in years. A lot of their songs have aged even if I do enjoy them from time to time. But I want to fulfill 12 year old me&rsquo;s dream of seeing them in concert. I think it would definitely be a fun experience, they can put on a show.</p>

<h3 id="who-would-i-not-see-live">Who Would I Not See Live?</h3>

<p>I looked at my top artists on Last.fm and there are a couple of musicians who I love dearly but would probably be okay with not seeing them live.</p>

<p><strong>DIR EN GREY</strong> is definitely one of those bands. While their music is banging, I&rsquo;ve never liked watching their performances. If I had the chance to see them, I would do it but it&rsquo;s definitely not pressing.</p>

<p><strong>Utada Hikaru</strong> is another artist. I love her but she is definitely a studio artist and not really great at performing. Her voice is a bit weak and it doesn&rsquo;t translate to great concerts. <strong>The Strokes</strong> is a band I wouldn&rsquo;t see for a similar reason. Their concerts always seem really lacking in energy. Julian Casablancas has a great voice regardless but they&rsquo;re usually just&hellip; Standing around on stage and engaging at all. They never seem like they&rsquo;re having fun.</p>

<p>My friend asked me to go see <strong>Thrice</strong> with him this February (I said no, mostly because he lives all the way in Australia). It would be a lot of fun to see Thrice but I&rsquo;m not that dedicated of a fan to do so. I only really like one of their albums. I don&rsquo;t know much of their discography.</p>

<p>That being said, even if I wouldn&rsquo;t go out of my way to see these artists live (I would fly to Japan to see L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel if I have to), I would totally go see them if it wasn&rsquo;t a hassle. Concerts are a lot of fun, even if you don&rsquo;t really know the band well or at all. Here&rsquo;s to hoping for more concert going in the future!</p>

</div>


<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria</strong> (-)
Even though I&rsquo;ve been making a conscious decision to not listen to as much Coheed and Cambria, I&rsquo;m still listening to them quite a lot. They&rsquo;re too good!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Vitamin String Quartet</strong> (*)
This came totally left field. I was looking for <em>In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</em> on Spotify and then I found that this group covered the entire album. When I looked through their discography, they covered a lot of cool alternative/rock/indie bands from the early to mid 2000&rsquo;s and I went on a huge nostalgia trip. It&rsquo;s a shame they&rsquo;re only a quartet, I feel like a lot of the songs would have benefited from an entire orchestra. But yeah. Would recommend.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Green Day</strong> (+6)
I have so much Green Day in my library, I never really noticed. Lately I&rsquo;ve been putting my library on shuffle and just letting it ride out. Some songs don&rsquo;t have a lot of draw for me anymore. But similar to last week, I am still rocking out to those <em>American Idiot</em> and <em>Nimrod</em> tunes.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thrice</strong> (*)
Thrice is a long time favourite of mine. I saw one of my friends listening to them on Spotify one day and I just went back and listened to them on repeat for a couple of hours.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse</strong> (+2)
I don&rsquo;t know how I overlooked some of Amy&rsquo;s songs. I still need to listen to her discography.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>My Chemical Romance</strong> (*)
This is another case of putting my library on shuffle, I feel. I have so much My Chemical Romance. I&rsquo;m like 99% sure I have their entire discography, bar B-sides and demos and concert versions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Eminem</strong> (*)
This week has just been pure nostalgia. With <em>Kamikaze</em> coming out, I went on Spotify and saved all the Eminem songs I listened to back in the day. A lot of them from <em>Encore</em>. This was another case of library shuffle and the Spotify algorithm probably picking more Eminem songs because he&rsquo;s popular.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Alexisonfire</strong> (*)
More nostalgia and more library shuffle! I didn&rsquo;t notice a lot of Alexisonfire this week. But I do recall rocking out to <em>We Are the Sound</em> a couple of times whenever it came on. It&rsquo;s hard not to.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joanna Newsom</strong> (*)
The nostalgia trip never ends. It&rsquo;s a shame that Joanna doesn&rsquo;t put her music on Spotify. I have most of her discography anyway (<em>Divers</em> was the last album I bought) and I can listen to it offline on Spotify but it&rsquo;s still a barrier.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mashrou&rsquo; Leila</strong> (*)
Wow, more nostalgia. Mashrou&rsquo; Leila is definitely more recent in my music history but I haven&rsquo;t picked them up in a couple of months and I totally forgot how they have a bunch of great bops.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures</strong> (-)
I told myself not to overplay this album but I just can&rsquo;t stay away from it. It&rsquo;s a little weird how no tracks made it into my top 10 songs for this week but that might be a good thing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension</strong> (+1)
<em>Domino</em> never gets old for me. Every time I listen to it, I can see the music video play so clearly in my head.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thrice — Vheissu</strong> (*)
<em>Vheissu</em> is easily my number one or number two favourite album of all time. There is no track in this album that I don&rsquo;t like or will ever skip. It&rsquo;s great from start to finish.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse — Back to Black</strong> (+2)
Not much to say about this one. Just been listening to a couple of tracks on repeat.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</strong> (-3)
Definitely slowly winding down on the Coheed. Mostly just listening to <em>A Favor House Atlantic</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I&rsquo;m Burning Star IV: Volume 1</strong> (-2)
Why is this album so good? Like, seriously. So many good songs on this album. But, still toning it down with the Coheed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joanna Newsom — Ys</strong> (*)
The only reason why <em>Vheissu</em> might be number two instead of number one is because of this album. I love this album. I think it is probably Joanna&rsquo;s best album. It is a beautifull crafted piece of art. I love it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I&rsquo;m Burning Star IV: Volume 2</strong> (*)
Was talking to my friend about a couple tracks from this album. It&rsquo;s pretty underrated, I&rsquo;m not sure why so many fans are &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Protest the Hero — Fortress</strong> (*)
I was looking for good study music but I didn&rsquo;t want like strings or lo-fi beats so I tried looking up metal/rock study music. Thank god Protest the Hero released instrumentals for their songs. Surprisingly, a lot of them definitely sound a lot less energetic without vocals. What a difference it makes!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Jeff Williams — RWBY Volume 1 Soundtrack</strong> (*)
RWBY Volume 1 has arguably the best soundtrack in the entire series. <em>This Will Be the Day</em>, <em>Gold</em>, <em>From Shadow</em>, <em>Mirror Mirror</em>, <em>Red Like Roses</em>, <em>I Burn</em>, <em>I May Fall</em>, <em>Wings</em>,&hellip; There are way too many good songs on it. The only song that I don&rsquo;t like from the soundtrack is probably <em>Red Like Roses Part II</em> (just kidding as I&rsquo;m writing this I&rsquo;m listening to it now and I like it).</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse — Tears Dry on Their Own</strong> (*)
<em>He walks away, the sun goes down, he takes the day but I&rsquo;m grown.</em> Oh Amy, thank you for gracing the world with your music. I really think this is a nice and hopeful song.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thank you Scientist — Feed the Horses</strong> (+7)
Wow, this song went up from last week. It&rsquo;s a good song but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why I keep listening to it as much as I have.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Domino the Destitute</strong> (-1)
This song is a banger. That is all.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — No World for Tomorrow</strong> (*)
Probably the best song off of the album. <em>Curse us, as god has.</em> Amazing. I would love to hear this song live one day. <em>There&rsquo;s no world for tomorrow, if we wait for today.</em> I remember talking about how <em>In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</em> made me feel like a soldier marching into battle, this definitely takes that concept and amps it up a hundred times.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kero Kero Bonito — Only Acting</strong> (-5)
Still a good song, just haven&rsquo;t been listening to it as much. Time to queue it up.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sharon Van Etten — A Crime</strong> (+1)
I hope I never grow tired of this song because it is beautiful.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — A Favor House Atlantic</strong> (-2)
The other day I looked up the music video for this song. It is so ridiculous but hilarious. They definitely take a jab at Green Day with Claudio dressing up in Billie Joe&rsquo;s trademark black button up and red tie, it&rsquo;s so funny.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Frank Carter &amp; The Rattlesnakes — Neon Rust</strong> (*)
I really need to listen to more of their songs because this is a really good song. I just love the atmosphere of the song. The melody in the beginning is really soothing and then it builds up to the chorus. It feels a little empty until the climax but it really releases all the tension in the song. So good.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK</strong> (-5)
Joji. Who hurt youuuuuuu??</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Crossing the Frame</strong> (*)
Good jam. <em>I&rsquo;m spying on you Newoooo.</em></p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria</strong> (-)
I&rsquo;m still riding that Coheed and Cambria hype. I&rsquo;m trying <em>so hard</em> not to be listening to them <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. I just want to play their new album over an over again!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Metric</strong> (*)
I have been playing a couple of their songs over and over again. They really make me want to jump up and dance!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Daughter</strong> (*)
This is another case of replaying a band over and over again. <em>Youth</em> is such a good song, I always feel it every single time I listen to it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>椎名林檎</strong> (+5)
Shiina Ringo came out with a song recently-ish and her catalog is now on Spotify. So I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of her this week.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>boy pablo</strong> (-4)
My boy, Pablo, is still a goodie but I feel like i&rsquo;m listening to too much of him. I only like two of his songs (or more accurately, I&rsquo;ve only listened to two of his songs).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kero Kero Bonito</strong> (*)
They released an album the same week that Coheed and Cambria released theirs and I like it a lot! <em>Only Acting</em> is my favourite from the album. I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it. Like a noisey grunge pop rock?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse</strong> (*)
I have no idea what triggered my Amy Winehouse resurgence. I loved her a lot back in junior high with her <em>Back to Black</em> album.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Childish Gambino</strong> (-)
<em>Feels Like Summer</em> is still a bop even though we&rsquo;re well into October. And since I&rsquo;m doing Sober October this month, <em>Sober</em> is my ironic song of the month. Even though the song title is &ldquo;Sober&rdquo; the chorus goes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be sober.&rdquo; The opposite of what I want but hey, it&rsquo;s catchy!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Green Day</strong> (*)
Wow, this is a surprise for me. I have no idea where this came from. I don&rsquo;t remember listening to this much Green Day. I did recently went through their entire catalog on Spotify and saved the songs that I like. I love a lot of their songs. It&rsquo;s always nostalgic listening to their songs. <em>Whatshername</em>  and <em>Redundant</em> are two songs I can think of listening to this week. So good.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joji</strong> (-7)
Ahhh, Joji. <em>SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK</em> is getting a little too melancholy for me. It&rsquo;s a good song though. I need to check out some of his other songs. There&rsquo;s this one song I do like but it&rsquo;s not on Spotify. Joji sampled and remixed a song and it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures</strong> (-)
This week Coheed is a little less dominating. But I still have been listening to a lot of them. I just can&rsquo;t keep my hands off <em>Vaxis: I</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</strong> (+1)
This album is slowly growing on me. It really is a huge epic. I need to take a couple more playthroughs with this.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — The Afterman: Ascension</strong> (+1)
Nostalgia is really hitting me hard with this. I say this a lot but <em>Ascension</em> is definitely one of my top albums of all time. It&rsquo;s just so good.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Good Apollo, I&rsquo;m Burning Star IV: I</strong> (-2)
I don&rsquo;t want to wear out <em>Good Apollo I</em> too much. This album is another nostalgic classic.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Kero Kero Bonito — Time &lsquo;n&rsquo; Place</strong> (*)
They released this album the same week Coheed released <em>Vaxis I</em> and I love it!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Amy Winehouse — Back to Black</strong> (*)
Really the only Amy Winehouse album that I&rsquo;ve listened to. I need to get a proper listen though. I&rsquo;m really only familiar with the singles and <em>Me and Mr. Jones</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK</strong> (*)
This is just a single. I&rsquo;m kinda looking forward to the album? <em>YEAH RIGHT</em> was a little iffy but I&rsquo;m optimistic for the rest of the album.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Front Bottoms — Talon of the Hawk</strong> (*)
One of my friends introduced me to this band and I really like them unironically. The vocalist has such a weird voice that I don&rsquo;t think is that good but it adds character. It&rsquo;s really folksy and it works for this band.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sharon Van Etten — Epic</strong> (*)
Oh man, why didn&rsquo;t I find about Sharon Van Etten earlier? <em>Epic</em> is a heartbreaking album. It details an abusive relationship Etten went through and her lyricism is  just so beautifully tragic. I love her.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mystery Skulls — Forever</strong> (*)
This band came up on my Discovery Weekly playlist, if I recall correctly. <em>Forever</em> is a decent album but there are a couple of standouts. One of my friends showed me the music video for <em>Ghost</em> and it&rsquo;s great. They recently came out with another music video and my favourite song from the album, <em>Every Note</em> is featured for like thirty seconds on it.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Kero Kero Bonito — Only Acting</strong> (*)
<em>I thought I was only acting but I felt exactly like it was all for real.</em> This song is so fun! I love it. I love the noisey grunge and the glitchy 80&rsquo;s/90&rsquo;s aesthetic.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Domino the Destitute</strong> (*)
Definitely one of Coheed&rsquo;s best songs. I&rsquo;m so surprised they don&rsquo;t play it more often in their shows. It&rsquo;s just so&hellip; Hard hitting. I get chills up my spine when I listen to it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — Evagria the Faithful</strong> (*)
I&rsquo;ve spoken about <em>Evagria</em> before but I love this song. It&rsquo;s groovy and funky and haunting. They really nailed the prog elements in this song.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Joji — SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK</strong> (*)
A small part of me is a little weirded out at how depressing Joji&rsquo;s songs are. Who hurt you Joji, who hurt you? But it makes for good songs.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — A Favour House Atlantic</strong> (*)
This is a poppy bop and a fun one to listen to live. <em>Good eye, sniper. Now I shoot, you run!</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coheed and Cambria — The Dark Sentencer</strong> (-3)
This song is slowly wearing out for me. But it&rsquo;s a good opener to a great album and a good head banger.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sharon Van Etten — A Crime</strong> (*)
<em>To say the things I want to say to you would be a crime/To admit I&rsquo;m still in love with you after all this time/I&rsquo;d rather let you touch my arm until you die.</em> Ahhh. Sharon Van Etten! Who hurt you?? It&rsquo;s such a beautiful and painful song. I love it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>boy pablo — Everytime</strong> (*)
The song that started it all for these boys. It&rsquo;s really mellow.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Thank you Scientist — Feed the Horses</strong> (*)
This band is on the record label that the frontman of Coheed and Cambria founded. They are so proggy, I enjoy it. They have a lot of jazz elements which is pretty cool.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mystery Skulls — Ghost</strong> (*)
Such. A. Bop. I want to sing along to it all the time. When I&rsquo;m in the office and this comes on, I definitely start mouthing the lyrics.</p></li>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that Coheed and Cambria has been pretty much all that I&rsquo;ve been listening to. With their album <em>Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures</em> coming out and seeing them live in concert, I&rsquo;ve just been falling in love with them all over again. The other artists in my top ten I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot as well.</p>

<p>Erkan is a person I&rsquo;ve met on Last.fm and he composes his own music. It&rsquo;s highly experimental and really intriguing. I do enjoy checking his works out. They&rsquo;re not very melodic and I put emphasis on experimental aspect. It&rsquo;s definitely something different.</p>

<p>Wow, who knew? Listening to Coheed and Cambria means that most of my top albums for this week is also Coheed and Cambria! I have been listening to <em>Vaxis I</em> on literal repeat. It is such a good album.</p>

<p><em>The Gutter</em> just might be song of the year. I am in love with it. I am currently fighting the urge to not put it on right now. In fact, I asked one of my friends to recommend me some music because I just can&rsquo;t continue to listening Coheed and Cambria almost exclusively.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is a reaction blog post which is mostly incoherent rambling and (you guessed it) real-time reactions to the songs. This is <em>not</em> a review.</p>

<p>The last time I did an album reaction was <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/the-afterman-ascension-a-reaction/">back in 2012</a>. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly), the last album reaction I did was to Coheed and Cambria&rsquo;s <em>The Afterman: Ascension</em>. It&rsquo;s fitting that the next album reaction is also Coheed and Cambria. With <em>Ascension</em>, my love for Coheed rekindled and with <em>Unheavenly Creatures</em>, I can see my love for Coheed rekindling for the second time.</p>

<p>I saw Coheed and Cambria live a couple of weeks ago and I&rsquo;ve been following their singles pretty closely. The singles off this album are all pretty legit. Like most Coheed songs, it took me a while to get used to the singles but they still got me pretty excited about the album.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;ve sacrificed my soul to Spotify, I streamed the album. I had work the day the album was released and at work, some people were talking about the album already. I debated listening to the album while working but no, I wanted to dedicate a solid hour of my undivided attention to this album. And I&rsquo;m glad I did!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>

<p>I really like the prologue. I&rsquo;ve gotten used to the piano bit from the singles and what not. I love how the music builds behind the narrator. It really does transition nicely into The Dark Sentencer.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Dark Sentencer</strong></p>

<p>Somehow, because of the prologue, this song sounds even more epic than it usually sounds. I <em>love</em> the beginning riff. I can&rsquo;t really say much about this one because I&rsquo;ve been listening to it for quite a while now. It&rsquo;s a good heavy song which I enjoy. I know some people enjoy Coheed&rsquo;s heavier stuff and while I do relish those heavy tracks, I don&rsquo;t mind it when they depart from it.</p>

<p>Looking at the lyrics now, I never paid much attention to the bridge where Claudio&rsquo;s voice has some sort of effect applied to it. It sounds like a robot but layered so not quite like autotune. I actually like it.</p>

<p><em>A place where the blind truly can see</em>
<em>Hear my voice, dearly departed, I beg on my knees</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unheavenly Creatures</strong></p>

<p>Interesting how the next song is another previously released track. It definitely jumped straight into <em>Unheavenly Creatures</em> without any sort of reprieve from <em>The Dark Sentence</em>. I do enjoy the synth sci-fi sounds in the background. I can probably see why when I saw Coheed and Cambria live, Claudio didn&rsquo;t bust out his guitar for this song. It&rsquo;s definitely not guitar heavy, or, at the very least, it&rsquo;s not the highlight of the song. It&rsquo;s definitely a poppier song. I&rsquo;m down with pop so I enjoy it.</p>

<p><em>So run, run, run, run like a son of a gun</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Toys</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly named. The intro to this song is very interesting. Wow. Immediate guitar chord. Claudio sounds like an angel. He&rsquo;s really going up into that falsetto. But I love those guitar chords. Sounds very rock opera-like. It&rsquo;s funny but once the guitars really kicked in, I was reminded of Green Day.</p>

<p>They seem to really like the build-up before the chorus.</p>

<p>One of my friends said that Coheed is really going &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; as in theatrical. I could see it.</p>

<p>I think this song might be lacking lyrically, unfortunately. No lines really stand out to me, yet. But I do find myself bopping my head to it. For some reason, I think &ldquo;knees&rdquo; might be the most used word in their lyrics.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kinda sad but I&rsquo;m resisting the urge to click to the next song. It seems really poppy, which I don&rsquo;t mind. But I feel like it&rsquo;s lacking. This song drags out a bit which is ironic because:</p>

<p><em>Oh can&rsquo;t you see, you&rsquo;re dragging me</em></p>

<p>Also. Fade out. Nice.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Black Sunday</strong></p>

<p>Oh this starts out pretty promising. I love it when Coheed gets all sinister. Claudio is doing some good vocal stuff in here. The guitar is on point in this one. I love the random sounding licks in the background. Very chaotic. Oof, more power rock-opera elements.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call this track <em>heavy</em> but it&rsquo;s definitely <em>rock</em>.</p>

<p>W O W. I enjoy the &ldquo;Black Sunday&rdquo; chant. I can see this being great to hear live.</p>

<p>Oh man, they busted out the military-like snare drum. Really reminds me of My Chemical Romance in a way.</p>

<p>The outro is nice.</p>

<p><em>Black Sunday, Black Sunday</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Queen of the Dark</strong></p>

<p>This sounds like a ballad. It starts off with some scarce piano. Then the guitar, drums, and Claudio come in. Definitely not a ballad.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about this song. It feels like exposition to me. There&rsquo;s a lot of repetition in this song. I feel like chanting two songs in a row is a bit excessive.</p>

<p>It has an interesting outro though. Some cool guitar effects. And then another kind of fade out. It doesn&rsquo;t actually fade out.</p>

<p><em>All hurt in time gets better</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>True Ugly</strong></p>

<p>Hard hitting. There&rsquo;s some clapping in this song. Interesting. High energy. I like. This song definitely has a more upbeat tempo. Oh shit. Claudio is doing some semi-scream thing and I dig it a lot. Claudio is definitely blab-singing (I have no idea how to describe it) but it&rsquo;s really interesting. Sounds really happy go lucky in the middle of a song like this.</p>

<p>I like this song. It deviates a little more from what I expected. It&rsquo;s a good mix of pop and prog. Sometimes I notice that there are points that seem to drag a bit. The difference is really noticeable in this song.</p>

<p>And <em>another</em> fade out.</p>

<p><em>Break, break, breaking up</em>
<em>Break, break, break,follow me</em>
<em>Can, can, can you hear me?</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Love Protocol</strong></p>

<p>And another immediate transition! The guitar sounds familiar. I wonder if it mirrors the prologue motif. This song&rsquo;s like another cheesy <em>Here to Mars</em> type song. A typical love song. But some of the lines really catch me. I also love the name of this song. Are there any protocols to love?</p>

<p><em>Oh, I can be your dancer</em>
<em>The one you set within your sights</em>
<em>When I admit surrender</em>
<em>Then maybe goodbye will turn to goodnight</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Pavillion (A Long Way Back)</strong></p>

<p>Y E S. I love titles with parentheses in them. This is another rock-opera sounding song. Maybe another ballad too? Not sure how I feel about the song itself though. Coheed is really channeling their inner Green Day/Queen/I don&rsquo;t really know what to compare them to.</p>

<p><em>Goodbye for now</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Night-Time Walkers</strong></p>

<p>Hmmm. Zombies are my first thought.</p>

<p>Okay. The intro is hella cool. I love the sci-fi space effects they&rsquo;re using on this album.</p>

<p>Ah. Another power ballad love song. Why is this album so cheesy? Could do with the fact that the two characters are a couple&hellip; It&rsquo;s right there in the album cover. I don&rsquo;t know why I thought different, haha.</p>

<p>The Claudio robot comes back. I really like it. But I don&rsquo;t understand a single thing. But it&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>The thing about this though is that the power chords just slow this song down so much. It does that for a lot of songs. It makes sense here but I&rsquo;m getting fatigued by it.</p>

<p><em>I don&rsquo;t wanna see you, I don&rsquo;t wanna believe you&rsquo;re here</em>
<em>But it&rsquo;s too hard not to when your songs I hear</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Gutter</strong></p>

<p>They love their hard cuts to the next song. <em>The Gutter</em> sounds really good in the context of the album.</p>

<p>Okay, I really love <em>The Gutter</em>. I love the pseudo screamy bits. Claudio&rsquo;s enunciation of &ldquo;gutter&rdquo; is perfect. This is probably my favourite song on the record. I would have been really happy to hear this song live in concert.</p>

<p>On a close listen, I can hear the orchestra in the background which is nice. I don&rsquo;t know how I never noticed it. It&rsquo;s pretty good right now. ALSO. Claudio laughing like an evil dude. He does it so well.</p>

<p><em>Now if I had my way</em>
<em>I would leave you here to waste your final days</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>All On Fire</strong></p>

<p>Okay I am <em>gutted</em> (haha) that <em>The Gutter</em> does not go to <em>Old Flames</em>. But this song has a piano intro which kinda makes up for it. Oooh this song sounds like a throwback. Hm. I also don&rsquo;t know how I feel about this song. I think this is definitely a grower. I could also see some of these lyrics becoming memes among the fandom. &ldquo;Please bring water&rdquo; x3. Amazing.</p>

<p><em>Come slither, you snake, please bring me back</em>
<em>To when life was wonderful</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>It Walks Among Us</strong></p>

<p>Another zombie sounding title. I love the intro effects. It sounds like clockwork. And the opening riff is some good stuff. Good synths too. More power chords. I. Think I like this. I&rsquo;m only a verse into it. I see a trend. I really like the sinister songs. When Claudio gets all kinda angry, haha. Not sure about the mixing on Claudio&rsquo;s voice in some parts though.</p>

<p>This song has some really good lines. I changed my most liked lines like three times. It&rsquo;s hard to pick.</p>

<p>Okay. Yeah. This is a good song.</p>

<p><em>Infected, don&rsquo;t provoke &lsquo;em</em>
<em>Feel free to cock and load &lsquo;em</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Old Flames</strong></p>

<p>Hearing these songs in the context of the album make me appreciate them a lot.</p>

<p>When the music video of this came out I was little apprehensive. They have a lot of interesting music videos but they never really jive with me. So when they brought out synchronized dance numbers, I was a little weirded out. It makes sense though.</p>

<p>Ah. I love this song! I&rsquo;m so torn between this song and <em>The Gutter</em> as my favourite song from the album. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so poppy that I like it. The outro is also really good. It somehow fits the song. Going out with a bang and then revelling the last peaceful moments.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</em>
<em>&ldquo;As the day we met.&rdquo;</em>
<em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re adorable.&rdquo;</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Lucky Stars</strong></p>

<p>The closer. I am heavy in anticipation.</p>

<p>Ooh, an acoustic guitar. Interesting. Another ballad? This is a true ballad, however. I remember reading somewhere about how some people were hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t end on a ballad. I do prefer ending out with a bang but <em>Old Flames</em> kind of fills that need. This might be another <em>Wake Up</em> for me. Way too cheesy but I&rsquo;ll end up memorizing the lyrics and singing along to it in concert.</p>

<p><em>This could be the biggest mistake we make in this life</em>
<em>Chasing as we tried to compete for each other&rsquo;s time</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m slightly disappointed this isn&rsquo;t an immediate &ldquo;wow I just fell in love with every single song&rdquo; record like <em>The Afterman: Ascension</em> was. I might have just been riding the hype of the singles and the concert. I felt the urge to skip a couple songs. There are some songs I already know I like but the others&hellip; They might have to grow on me. But I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good mix. I liked 9 out of the 15 songs (including <em>Prologue</em>). I think that&rsquo;s a good ratio especially for a first listen.</p>
