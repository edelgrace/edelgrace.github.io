      <description>Disclaimer: This is not a concert review and really is just me rambling about a band I like
Last Saturday, I went to go see Coheed and Cambria live. Coheed and Cambria is a progressive rock band. Prog rock is a genre that&amp;rsquo;s hard to define without hearing it. The way I see it, prog rock is definitely a more artsy genre. It&amp;rsquo;s usually complex musically and lyrically incorporating several genres such as jazz and pop but still maintaining an aggressive and heavy rock sound.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is not a concert review and this post contains swearing
One of the things on my 25 before 25 bucket list was to go see a concert. The last concert I went to when I made my bucket list was the Japanese band Lix at an anime convention back in 2012 (but that slipped my mind when I wrote it and I said the last concert I went to was a My Chemical Romance concert).</description>

      <description>Last night, I had my very first concert experience. That&amp;rsquo;s right, I saw My Chemical Romance. It was amazingly awesome. For some reason though, I expected it to be much more&amp;hellip; Epic. A lot of people here on Mibba describe their first concert like it was the best orgasm of life.
But for me, it was kinda awkward and surreal. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that the band was really in front of me.</description>
