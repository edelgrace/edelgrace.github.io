<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for Wednesday to come around so I&rsquo;m doing my WIP Wednesday now.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m working on a shawl for one of my best friends. Just last week, my friend told me that she had cancer. She has had problems with her thyroid for a very long time and her family doctor never did anything about it despite her concerns. It wasn&rsquo;t until just the past couple of months that she got a second opinion. She got it checked out and they decided that they&rsquo;ll have to take out her thyroid. The surgery is this Thursday. I&rsquo;m confident everything will go well but I wanted to make a small something for her.</p>

<p>She is always self-conscious about her swollen thyroid and always wears a scarf. After her surgery, I can imagine she will feel the same still and therefore I decided to make her a shawl.</p>

<p>My friend can be a little picky about fashion so it was a bit hard to find a pattern I thought she would like. She mentioned she didn&rsquo;t like triangle scarves. She&rsquo;s also appreciates simple clothes so I tried to look for something not too flashy. I eventually settled on the <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-v-scarf">V Scarf</a>.</p>

<li>Yarn: <a href="https://www.sugarbushyarns.com/yarn/itty-bitty.html">Sugar Bush Itty-Bitty Yarn</a> (Sport yarn)</li>
</ul>

<p>I met her four years ago while I was taking summer classes. We had two classes together and it was in the first week that I noticed this. She seemed like such a cute and shy girl that I really wanted to be friends with her (I&rsquo;m a huge proponent of the underdog) I one day I sat next to her in our Political Science class and talked to her before class started. I don&rsquo;t remember what I said to her but when we were looking back on it, she told me that I was speaking so loud that everyone was looking at us and that she thought I was really weird.</p>

<p>We bonded very quickly since we had a lot of common experiences. Both of us had crushes on TAs we once had, we both had immigrant parents, and we both (at the time) had similar values. We also had a lot not in common. I&rsquo;m a huge nerd while she was very not. She&rsquo;s Sikh, I&rsquo;m mostly Catholic.</p>

<p>However, I am really grateful that she&rsquo;s one of my best friends because we are so different. Being around people just like you doesn&rsquo;t really allow you to grow. Having different perspectives is valuable to me. She was also the very first friend I made out of my own inhibition at university. Most of my friends at that time were met through mutual friends or a result of group projects where I just had no choice to get along with some people.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really hard trying to make something for people you care about because you just want it to be perfect. I&rsquo;m also on a time crunch which added a little bit more pressure.</p>

<p>Below is the shawl I originally wanted to make her. I didn&rsquo;t make a lot of progress on it so not that much time was invested into it.</p>

<p>The yarn got tangled midway through. I know it will take me a couple of hours to untangle it and I couldn&rsquo;t dedicate all that time to do so. Where I went wrong was definitely having a very tight tension when I was winding the yarn into a cake. I am not sure about this colour scheme for my friend anyway.</p>

<p>Hopefully, my friend will like the shawl I&rsquo;m making her. I know that she will appreciate it nonetheless but I&rsquo;d love to see her wear it at least once in a while. Fingers crossed that I can finish it!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This year I&rsquo;m doing a temperature blanket for real. My inspiration comes from <a href="http://incyanity.net/book-of-days/temp-blanket-go">Sakaane</a> who is also doing a temperature blanket. I deliberated over how I wanted to make the blanket. I already had a ton of squares but I know myself too well. I would never get around to joining all those squares and weaving in all those ends.</p>

<p>After browsing multiple projects and patterns, I decided on doing a linen/moss/granite stitch (how could one stitch have so many names?). I chained 160 + 1 in order to make a twin-ish sized blanket and went at it. So far, I&rsquo;ve only done January and I still have all of February to catch up on.</p>

<p>The lighting is kinda bad so the picture makes the blanket look a lot brighter than it really is. The spring green doesn&rsquo;t look nearly as gross as that. And it might be hard to tell, but the first row is actually in teal.</p>

<h3 id="colours-i-m-using">Colours I&rsquo;m Using</h3>

<p>Each row represents the average temperature of that day. The yarn I decided on was <em>Bernat Premium</em> because it&rsquo;s cheap (whoops) and plentiful. The colour scheme I&rsquo;m using is below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>30C+</strong>: Red</li>
<li><strong>20C to 30C</strong>: Orange</li>
<li><strong>10C to 20C</strong>: Gold</li>
<li><strong>0C to 10C</strong>: Spring Green</li>
<li><strong>-10C to 0C</strong>: Green</li>
<li><strong>-20C to -10C</strong>: Teal</li>
<li><strong>-20C to -30C</strong>: Royal Blue</li>
<li><strong>-30C+</strong>: Navy Blue</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see from the colour scheme, this has been a mild winter so far. Not -30C+ averages thankfully. It&rsquo;s even been breaking into the positives! I&rsquo;m really hoping I can use my navy blue at least once this winter. If not, there&rsquo;s always December to look forward to!</p>

      <figcaption><h4>My handy dandy spreadsheet</h4>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>I have a recurring task in <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> that simply says &ldquo;Input into stats spreadsheet&rdquo; which I do every morning once I wake up. This spreadsheet keeps track of not only the temperature of the day, but how many hours I slept that night, how many hours I spent on my phone, and how many tasks I managed to finish.</p>

<p>Anyway, once I finish crocheting a row, I simply strike out the appropriate cell. I use conditional formatting to change the background colour of the cell to the colour that I should use for that day. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to differentiate the colours but I just need to double check myself sometimes.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>I think the blanket is going pretty well. By the time this is posted, I&rsquo;m hoping to have caught up to the end of February. I&rsquo;m honestly so jazzed at how nice it&rsquo;s looking so far. I really like how the stitch looks. My only concern is how long it will end up being. It&rsquo;s already 5 inches for 20 rows. So for ~360 rows&hellip; That&rsquo;s 90 inches long! That&rsquo;s okay, I plan to wrap myself up in it for those cold Calgary winter nights.</p>

          <p><p>In my <a href="/blog/productive-distractions/">last post</a> I talked about making my boyfriend a scarf. I started it yesterday after showing him a couple of sample swatches. Out of all the scarves I showed him, he liked this one of a crochet <a href="http://www.fiberfluxblog.com/2013/01/free-crochet-patternoutline-ribbed-scarf.html">Outline Ribbed Scarf</a>. It&rsquo;s a rather simple scarf which is nice because it&rsquo;ll work up quickly. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll finish the scarf by his birthday.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures of the test swatches I made. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if he wanted the simple one stripe line like in the pattern so I did a couple of each.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-01.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-02.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/outline-ribbed-scarf-03.png" alt="swatch" /></p>

<p>When I sent the pictures to my boyfriend, he said he liked all of them. Which wasn&rsquo;t too helpful for me but at least he is not opposed it so far. Thankfully that section of the scarf doesn&rsquo;t come up for a while since it is worked horizontally.</p>

<p>Yesterday I just chained around 300 chains to start off the scarf and finished around two rows. I think I made it a little too long. My boyfriend is like 6&rsquo; and I made the scarf to be a couple more inches longer than that. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>The colours were chosen by my boyfriend himself. There&rsquo;s a game that we&rsquo;ve been playing together called Warframe and the colours he chose were the colours of one of his characters that we play. If you don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://warframe.com">Warframe</a> is a free-to-play online third person shooter. It&rsquo;s a good grind for those who like that kind of games. It reminds me a lot of Destiny!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I made the scarf too long and I had to frog all of my work. I managed to get back to where I was then the yarn tangled on me. Now I have untangle it&hellip; Such is life.</p>

          <p><p>It&rsquo;s my boyfriend&rsquo;s birthday coming up soon. I wanted to make him a knitted or a crocheted item because I need something to keep my hands busy. Plus aren&rsquo;t handmade things the sweetest thing you could get as a present??</p>

<p>On some level, I know he&rsquo;s a little picky about what kind of things he would like to wear. To avoid spending a ton of time working on something that he might not ever wear, I sent him a couple links to patterns of scarves and toques. I may have added a few slouchy beanies in the list of links because I think he would look really good in a slouchy beanie. Lo and behold, out of all the links I sent him, he liked the one non-slouchy beanie the most. I&rsquo;m not annoyed or anything but I am pretty amused. I love little moments like these.</p>

<p>To be honest, there are a ton of projects that I should be working on instead of thinking of this (to name a few, school assignments). However this is one of those things that I call a &ldquo;productive distraction.&rdquo; Writing this blog post is a productive distraction in itself.</p>

<p>I even had a productive distraction between thinking that I needed to write this post and actually starting to write it. I was originally planning to write only a short paragraph. Then I wondered if I should separate long form blog posts with my status-like blog posts. I turned to <a href="https://jack.baty.net">Jack Baty</a> for some inspiration. I really admire the web presence that Jack has and I like his gutso for mixing microblogging with regular blogging. The stream of consciousness approach is something that I really would like to emulate.</p>

<p>So I went to his website. Then I found myself on a couple of other websites. Now I have more things on my to-do list.</p>
