      <description>I had a dream, that Gerard Way and Amy Lee were at my church and they fighting over who was a better singer. It was so weird. Then suddenly, Gerard got naked. One second he had clothes, the next he didn&amp;rsquo;t. He just magically got naked and strangely, Amy wasn&amp;rsquo;t bothered with it.
I also had a dream that Billie Joe Armstrong murdered someone and got into jail and went all crazy up in the mind.</description>
