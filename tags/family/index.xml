      <description>The Game
Take turns to ice an object or living being onto a cookie. Everyone guesses what that person iced onto the cookie. There are no winners, just a bunch of people having fun and joking around about their lack of (or possession of) artistic ability.
The Background
Over the holidays I was baking brownies and cookies with my cousins. The brownies had left over frosting so we decided to ice the cookies with cool designs.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I celebrated my 22nd birthday.
Every year we go to mass on my birthday in the morning as a family. This year my dad was working but my little cousin was with us because we were babysitting him so that was okay. Every year the homily is about the same. My birthday falls on the feast day of the Holy Family. So the homily is usually about obeying and honouring your parents; how Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were the perfect family; and so on.</description>
