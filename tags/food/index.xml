      <description>Last week was the start of Reading Week. Reading Week is basically my university&amp;rsquo;s version of &amp;ldquo;midterm break&amp;rdquo; where we have a week off. I don&amp;rsquo;t have classes on Friday so my Reading Week started early.
Penguins On Friday, my boyfriend and I went to the zoo. We really wanted to see the penguins and the red pandas. Every day, the penguins take a walk around the zoo. It was adorable.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I went out with my SO for Vietnamese food. There&amp;rsquo;s a decently sized restaurant called Bow River Vietnamese Restaurant that&amp;rsquo;s close by his house. I regret not taking pictures but their deep fried wontons were delicious. It had a good amount of meat and perfect crunchy crust. The sauce they provided it with was good as well.
For myself, I ordered a regular beef noodle soup. In the soup was tripe, brisket, and beef balls in it.</description>

Lunch break with cantaloupes and warm pandesal with cheese. I usually donâ€™t like eating at my desk when it comes to breads, especially crumbly breads like pandesal but I was totally craving it.</description>
