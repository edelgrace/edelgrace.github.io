<p>This weekend was a very filling one. Each day I was eating something yummy, somewhere!</p>

<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>

<p>My brother and my cousin went to <a href="https://www.bluefinsushiab.com/">Blue Fin Sushi</a>. They have an all you can eat lunch pretty cheaply for $17.84 CAD. No limits or anything! I was supposed to go with them last week but I ended up missing it. Last week my cousin ate so much he threw up. I took that as a good sign that they wouldn&rsquo;t skimp out on the food.</p>

<p>So my brother and cousin suggested to go again and I could finally go with them! I had been waiting for this lunch the entire week. I definitely did not push myself to the point of throwing up but I did eat enough to feel considerably full. I could have powered through one more order but it is a lot of sushi!</p>

<h2 id="saturday">Saturday</h2>

<p>My birthday was last December. I originally planned for a lunch but the weather was extremely bad. It snowed quite a lot and the roads were terrible for driving. So I cancelled it and then rescheduled! Unfortunately not everyone could make it still but still had good attendance.</p>

<p>The person who couldn&rsquo;t make it was the person we were counting on guiding us through the menu since he&rsquo;s been there a couple of times. I decided on going to <a href="http://www.moonkoreanbbq.com/">Moon Korean BBQ</a> because I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but rave reviews about it from my friends. It was the cutest little restaurant. The decor was minimalistic but also homely with some Korean pop music going on in the background.</p>

<p>They even had the cutest cutlery sets!</p>

<p>Anyway, we ended up just getting the all you can eat menu. We had a two hour time limit of 10 different items per round. We ate a lot of meat and opted for grilling our food ourselves (but not without some handholding from our server).</p>

<p>The food was absolutely delicious. I wish I remembered to buy cheesecake for dessert though. 10 out of 10, would eat again!</p>

<h2 id="sunday">Sunday</h2>

<p>Sunday was much less glamorous. My cousin had coupons for Taco Time and we just went and bought burritos. I bought a beef and cheese burrito and, man, it is a lot of meat. I could not finish it and felt full for the rest of the day. We also went to buy timbits for a snack afterwards.</p>

<p>There was a Goodwill nearby and we decided to drop in. I&rsquo;ve never been there before and wanted to see what was there. There were a bunch of cheap tea sets that made me think of <em>Moon Korean BBQ</em>. I know where I will shop for my dishes and such for when I move out!</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>

<p>This weekend was really nice! I spent too much money and calories on food, however. I&rsquo;m hoping to cut down on all this food from this point forward.</p>

          <p><p>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&rsquo;s network&#8230; Kinda rough.</p>

<p>However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently doing an inventory of our gear and before I left for holidays, I was labelling items that needed to be recycled or sold. Apparently some of the labels fell off so I reinforced them all with tape. Since I was gone for two weeks, there were a couple of new devices in our inventory so I took note of those as well.</p>

<p>Some of the devices are strewn about the place with no order so I attempted to move some of them into groups of device types. For example, some of the supervisor engines were mixed with the switches when there was a shelf dedicated solely for engines.</p>

<p>We use bins to store smaller items. Some of the bins didn&rsquo;t have any labels so I had to make some in order for people to know where everything is. I also labelled some ambiguos boxes. It&rsquo;s a big guessing game looking at them all.</p>

<p>I received a package from Meraki containing a Meraki access point. Pretty cool! I thought that maybe I needed to do something with it for work so I read the manual but it turned out that it&rsquo;s mine to keep. It&rsquo;s super sleek.</p>

<p>In my co-op, I have to hand in reports in order to get credit. One of the first things I have to hand in during the start of the work term is learning objectives. I spent a good amount of time trying to think up of what I wanted to accomplish during this work term. I&rsquo;m still pretty undecided as I don&rsquo;t want to repeat myself from last term&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

<p>After work, I went over to my SO&rsquo;s place. While he played Vermintide with friends, I continued reading <em>Buried in Books</em> by Julie Rugg. Basically it&rsquo;s a collection of quotes regarding books and reading. I love reading books about books and reading. What Ilove more is reading a book about books that are about books and reading.</p>

<p>After that we settled in for some quiet time to work on a puzzle I bought him for Christmas. It&rsquo;s a big 1000 piece puzzle of a volcano. I chose it because it was cool and dramatic and it was more than two colours. I guess some people like the challenge of putting together a puzzle of the ocean and the sky but not us.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my day in a nutshell. A very chill and relaxing day. Now I&rsquo;m hoping to tinker with the access point I received, work out a little, and study a bit for my CCNA before I hit the hay.</p>

          <p><p>Yesterday I celebrated my 22nd birthday.</p>

<p>Every year we go to mass on my birthday in the morning as a family. This year my dad was working but my little cousin was with us because we were babysitting him so that was okay. Every year the homily is about the same. My birthday falls on the feast day of the Holy Family. So the homily is usually about obeying and honouring your parents; how Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were the perfect family; and so on. It kinda gets boring after a while.</p>

<p>After that I went over to my SO&rsquo;s house to chill for a bit before we headed out for lunch. We had to wait for his brother to come over to watch the house before we left.</p>

<p>For lunch I met a couple of friends at a vegan restaurant downtown called The Coup. I regret not taking picures but it was a nice and cozy place with extremely friendly servers. The food was definitely different as you might expect from a vegan place. One of my friends ordered a London Fog and it came with the tea strainer place on top of the cup. It was very fancy. The food was delicious as well. I ordered a hot pot that was deliciously creamy and filled to the brim with, you guessed it, veggies. No complaints here though, it was amazing.</p>

<p>The discussions while we were eating was pretty typical as I&rsquo;d expect from a bunch of nerds like us. Talked a bit about programming languages that don&rsquo;t have variable typing, Magic tournaments (I know nothing about Magic), shenanigans that happen in Physics club (I am not part of the physics club), anime, etc. I had a fun time and since I see my friends so rarely it was a nice treat.</p>

<p>Afterwards my SO and I got driven back to his place. We watched a bit of Warhammer: Vermintide character analysis videos on YouTube (I don&rsquo;t play that game). Then I had to go home, which wasn&rsquo;t all that bad since family was waiting for me.</p>

<p>My little cousin and my brother were playing video games, as always. My cousin had been playing Pokemon on my 3DS nonstop. At least my Pokemon are all trained now. I will admit, I did take a nap. When I woke up my aunt and uncle were there as well as my uncle&rsquo;s nephew. I groggily sat up and watched my brother play the video game I bought him for Christmas.</p>

<p>Once everyone was here, we ate. I ate a bunch of chips, spaghetti, lumpia, turkey, and some veggies. The cake I bought was cheesecake so I ate some of that too.</p>

<p>Eventually my cousins left and the parents were all that remained. They mostly drank and talked amongst themselves while my brother and I were absorbed in <em>Saints Row the Third</em>. Of course, they left eventually too. After a quick prayer we all went to bed.</p>

<p>I think I had a pretty good birthday. It&rsquo;s always nice to be surrounded by friends, family, and good food.</p>
