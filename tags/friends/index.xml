      <description>The holidays are officially over, for I went back to work today. It was a bit of a slow day. I got my internship extended, however they basically treated me as a new hire since my contract ended in December. So I&amp;rsquo;m starting from scratch, essentially. I had no laptop, no e-mail, no account to login into any computer connected to the company&amp;rsquo;s network&amp;#8230; Kinda rough.
However, I did manage to do some small tasks that didn&amp;rsquo;t require the use of a computer.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I celebrated my 22nd birthday.
Every year we go to mass on my birthday in the morning as a family. This year my dad was working but my little cousin was with us because we were babysitting him so that was okay. Every year the homily is about the same. My birthday falls on the feast day of the Holy Family. So the homily is usually about obeying and honouring your parents; how Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were the perfect family; and so on.</description>
