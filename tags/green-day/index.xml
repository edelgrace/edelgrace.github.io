      <description>So this year I went to a bunch of concerts. Two of those concerts (Alexisonfire and Coheed and Cambria) were big wish listers for me and this got me thinking. What other artists do I want to see live?
L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel I know for sure that I want to see L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel live in concert. L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is a band I got into around junior high. Thanks to the power of the Internet, I know approximately the first time I fell in love with L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel.</description>

      <description>I had a dream, that Gerard Way and Amy Lee were at my church and they fighting over who was a better singer. It was so weird. Then suddenly, Gerard got naked. One second he had clothes, the next he didn&amp;rsquo;t. He just magically got naked and strangely, Amy wasn&amp;rsquo;t bothered with it.
I also had a dream that Billie Joe Armstrong murdered someone and got into jail and went all crazy up in the mind.</description>

      <description>Hello! I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while. For some reason I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Geek Stink breath a lot. I miss the old GSB, when there were more people there. I still love GSB though!
I have been working on my religion project for the past four days. I&amp;rsquo;m finally finished now. Thank goodness. Who knew that a simple powerpoint about a saint would be so much work? I guess I&amp;rsquo;m too much of a perfectionist.</description>

      <description>My locker&amp;rsquo;s right next to the band room, and grade niners are constantly standing around my locker. The grade niners like to listen to this guy play the drums every single lunch period. I was opening my locker, and the guy who plays the drums was looking at my locker. They saw my Billie Joe Armstrong poster (which unfortunately does not exist anymore because one of my friends tore it up).</description>
