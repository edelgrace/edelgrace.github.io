      <description>Last.fm is a website that can keep track of users and their listening habits. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to music with Last.fm since 2010 and am slightly obsessive over my music stats. These stats are for my listening from the past week.

      <description>So this year I went to a bunch of concerts. Two of those concerts (Alexisonfire and Coheed and Cambria) were big wish listers for me and this got me thinking. What other artists do I want to see live?
L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel I know for sure that I want to see L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel live in concert. L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel is a band I got into around junior high. Thanks to the power of the Internet, I know approximately the first time I fell in love with L&amp;rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel.</description>
