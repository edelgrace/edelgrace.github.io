      <title>My Chemical Romance in Concert</title>

      <description>Last night, I had my very first concert experience. That&amp;rsquo;s right, I saw My Chemical Romance. It was amazingly awesome. For some reason though, I expected it to be much more&amp;hellip; Epic. A lot of people here on Mibba describe their first concert like it was the best orgasm of life.
But for me, it was kinda awkward and surreal. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that the band was really in front of me.</description>

      <description>I had a dream, that Gerard Way and Amy Lee were at my church and they fighting over who was a better singer. It was so weird. Then suddenly, Gerard got naked. One second he had clothes, the next he didn&amp;rsquo;t. He just magically got naked and strangely, Amy wasn&amp;rsquo;t bothered with it.
I also had a dream that Billie Joe Armstrong murdered someone and got into jail and went all crazy up in the mind.</description>

      <description>Three days ago, I started school, and I found out that we no longer have homerooms. Now we have TA I went to my TA in the band room and found three grade niners there, and I thought I was in the wrong homeroom, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Oh and guess who my teacher advisors are? The principal and the vice principal! This is going to be one great year.
I have three of my friends in my TA and I have to stick with my TA Until I finish junior high&amp;hellip; bleh.</description>

      <description>Note: This post has been edited from its original for spelling, grammar, and less cringe. Why did I use ellipses so much back then?
I&amp;rsquo;m excited, even though I&amp;rsquo;m nowhere near Toronto. Just on the other coast&amp;hellip; The last time they were on Much on Demand (MOD) was on th 11th of May&amp;hellip; It was a Friday&amp;hellip;.. *sigh* I&amp;rsquo;m very excited.. And Kelly Clarkson was on MOD a few moments ago&amp;hellip; She&amp;rsquo;s funny&amp;hellip;</description>

Much Music just premiered the music video Teenagers by My Chemical Romance like, a minute ago&amp;hellip; It was good video&amp;hellip; Good song, but where&amp;rsquo;s the usual &amp;ldquo;theatrical&amp;rdquo; video??? Whatever, it was still good as always&amp;hellip; Teenagers is my brother&amp;rsquo;s favourite song because, in his words, &amp;ldquo;teenagers really do scare me&amp;hellip; Like you.&amp;rdquo; And then I&amp;rsquo;m like &amp;ldquo;Uh&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not a teenager&amp;hellip; Yet.</description>
