I’m feeling super down for some reason right now and I can’t really pinpoint what it is. It feels like there’s a dark cloud looming over my head. I tried to make my notes look extra neat, neater than usual, as that usually helps me calm down whenever I do feel like this.</description>

I’m in the middle of trying out studyign{.tumblelog}’s method of taking textbook notes for my algorithm design class.
