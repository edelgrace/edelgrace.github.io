Some pictures of my diy planner, taken with a potato. I borrowed inspiration from diyfish inserts. Whenever I open it up, I can see my whole month and reoccurring tasks right in front of me.</description>

      <description>2015.08.12 &amp;#8211; Working on my DIY planner while watching my brother playing GTAV in the living room. This time, I’m not using my Filofax because I can’t dedicate that much time to cutting up that much paper. As always, my pages are heavily inspired by DIYfish’s Life Mapping System inserts. I just love being able to see my monthly view and (half of) my weekly view at the same time.</description>
