<blockquote>
<p>Love as sickness and immorality, sex as entrapment and revenge—these are the themes that the Nobel Prize-winning author of <em>Snow Country</em> dramatizes with such coolly mesmerizing power in this novel. At its heart is is a destructive love affair between a married writer and a teenage girl that continues to haunt both of them more than twenty years after their last embrace—and whose lingering bitterness poisons everyone around them.</p>

<p>What begins as a sentimental reunion between the aging Oki Toshio and the reclusive artist Otoko Ueno escalates into a sinister erotic vendetta. For Keiko, the strange, intense young girl who is Otoko&rsquo;s protegee and lover, is determined to avenge the older woman&rsquo;s past humiliation—even if that means using her own beauty as a weapon. Shifting unpredictably between tenderness and obsession, serenity and savagery, <em>Beauty and Sadness</em> confirms Kawabata&rsquo;s reputation as a modern Japanese master who can turn the tightening of an <em>obi</em> into something infinitely suggestive and perverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kawabata haunts me. How apt, considering by the time this blog post is published, it&rsquo;s nearly Hallowe&rsquo;en.</p>

<p>This is the third Kawabata book that I&rsquo;ve read. I just keep coming back for more. Every time I find myself in the library, I wander over to the &ldquo;K&rdquo; authors and see if there&rsquo;s anything there by Kawabata.</p>

<p>There is a pattern in Kawabata&rsquo;s works. His characters are largely unlikeable and one-dimensional, especially the protagonist. What is with Kawabata and writing useless men as protagonists? Because Oki is the most boring and dull protagonist.</p>

<p>Kawabata, however, redeems himself in his prose. Even with these heavily flawed characters, Kawabata manages to make me feel these character&rsquo;s struggles and I can sympathize with them because he can portray them so well.</p>

<p>Concerning the controversial subject matter, I did not read the summary before reading this book. When it was revealed that Oki was a 30-something-year-old man and Otoko was just 16 when their affair started, I was startled. I don&rsquo;t want to say Kawabata doesn&rsquo;t make a big deal about it because he does. The book essentially revolves around the messy aftermath of Otoko and Oki&rsquo;s relationship.</p>

<p>Otoko is undeniably broken after. She miscarriages with Oki&rsquo;s child and is sent to a mental institution. She becomes a successful painter and begins a relationship with a young woman (girl? I don&rsquo;t know how old she is) named Keiko. In many ways, this relationship mirrors Otoko&rsquo;s relationship with Oki.</p>

<p>In a way, Kawabata forces you to accept the fact that Oki had done this to Otoko. He does romanticize it too much for my comfort (Otoko continues to pine over Oki even twenty years later despite all he put her through) but he does not neglect to show how harmful the relationship was.</p>

<p>Keiko is the character who realizes how despicable Oki is and she tries to get revenge. I was torn in a couple places. Even though Keiko claims to want revenge against Oki, I felt like Keiko was really getting revenge on Otoko. I think, deep down, Keiko knew that Otoko did not love Keiko or did not love her as deeply as she did Oki.</p>

<p>Honestly, Keiko is the weakest point in the story for me. I did not care for her one bit. I saw the ending coming a mile away. Keiko and Oki&rsquo;s son go out for a boat ride. Oki&rsquo;s son presumably drowns but Keiko lives. I can&rsquo;t help but feel Keiko was malicious enough to plan it out. It was the highest form of revenge. Otoko has her own child taken away from her. Oki must feel the same pain as well.</p>

<p>Overall, not Kawabata&rsquo;s strongest. But I relish these melodramatic, melancholic, love-stricken stories of his.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It&rsquo;s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there&rsquo;s a better way.</p>

<p>In <em>Deep Work</em>, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four &ldquo;rules,&rdquo; for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.</p>

<p>A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. <em>Deep Work</em> is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cal has a lot of good ideas but I hate how he presented them.</p>

<p>I pretty much skimmed through the first section that was trying to convince me that deep work was worth it. Of course, I know it&rsquo;s worth it, why else would I be reading this book? As a computer scientist, I don&rsquo;t mind that the examples he spouts off are largely tech-related and usually intended for office/self-employed workers. However, there&rsquo;s a lot of anecdotes in this book. There are some mentions of studies here and there but the evidence is still lacking.</p>

<p>When it comes to social media, he comes off as pretentious and snobby even if he is mostly right. I&rsquo;ve read some of Cal&rsquo;s blog posts before and I had the same impression of him back then. I am a bit defensive over the usage of my social media even though I know I&rsquo;d probably be better off without. But Cal brings up the point of, think what you could be doing in your time instead. And I agree.</p>

<p>Regardless, there&rsquo;s a lot of things I want to try out from this book.</p>

<ul>
<li>Commit to a rhythmic philosophy of deep work</li>
<li>Ritualize where and how I will work</li>
<li>Follow 4DX (quick note, this largely taken from another author)</li>
<li>Focus on just the important goal</li>
<li>Measure new behaviours that drive success AKA keeping track of deep work hours (i.e. lead measures)</li>
<li>Keep a scoreboard (like a streak)</li>
<li>Create accountability with weekly reviews</li>
<li>Take breaks from focus over distractions (schedule hours dedicated to the Internet instead of hours dedicated to work)</li>
<li>Quit social media (almost)</li>
<li>Re-evaluate the social networks I&rsquo;m a part of (including Goodreads)</li>
<li>Take a month-long &ldquo;sabbatical&rdquo; from social media and see if anyone misses me</li>
<li>Schedule every minute of my day</li>
<li>Finish work by 16:30 (in the book Cal says 17:30 but I&rsquo;m assuming he starts work at 9:00 whereas I start work at 8:00)</li>
<li>Become hard to reach (e-mail and phone only, maybe Discord still?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, there are good things to try out with this book. Cal takes until the very end to say deep work is not for everybody (with his usual pretentious air). I&rsquo;m going to take a crack at it. I&rsquo;ve found that ever since I&rsquo;ve graduated and started working, my hours are incredibly limited. After careful attention, I&rsquo;ve realized that much of my day is dedicated to shallow activities. I want to get things done (yes, I&rsquo;ve read David Allen&rsquo;s GTD).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boris and Arkady Strugatsky were the greatest science fiction writers of the Soviet era: their books were intellectually provocative and riotously funny, full of boldly imagined scenarios and veiled—but clear—social criticism. Which may be why Definitely Maybe has never before been available in an uncensored edition, let alone in English.</p>

<p>It tells the story of astrophysicist Dmitri Malianov, who has sent his wife and son off to her mother’s house in Odessa so that he can work, free from distractions, on the project he’s sure will win him the Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>But he’d have an easier time making progress if he wasn’t being interrupted all the time: First, it’s the unexpected delivery of a crate of vodka and caviar. Then a beautiful young woman in an unnervingly short skirt shows up at his door. Then several of his friends—also scientists—drop by, saying they all felt they were on the verge of a major discovery when they got&hellip; distracted&hellip;</p>

<p>Is there an ominous force that doesn’t want knowledge to progress? Or could it be something more&hellip; natural?</p>

<p>In this nail-bitingly suspenseful book, the Strugatsky brothers bravely and brilliantly question authority: an authority that starts with crates of vodka, but has lightning bolts in store for humans who refuse to be cowed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book is like philosophical discourse disguised as fiction. It reminds me of one of their other works, <em>Roadside Picnic</em>. In <em>Roadside Picnic</em>, there is a scene where two characters discuss how aliens could have visited Earth just like they were having a, you guessed it, roadside picnic. While initially, I thought it was a bit out of place, it became my favourite part of the book. <em>Definitely Maybe</em> is like that conversation but instead of a couple pages, it&rsquo;s an entire book.</p>

<p>The discussion in this book revolves around two main things: a theory similar to The Great Filter and duty to mankind.</p>

<p>A big oversimplification of The Great Filter is the theory that civilizations can only evolutionize and innovate to a certain point. This could be a reason why aliens have not yet communicated with us yet. In <em>Definitely Maybe</em>, it seems like the filter could be something naturally occurring. There are several men who are on the verge of scientific breakthroughs which could very well lead men into the stars. However, they are always distracted by their work. I enjoyed this discussion greatly as I was immediately reminded of The Great Filter. It really made me wonder and it was just so clever. The only reason why I would even call this book sci-fi is because of this aspect. While I don&rsquo;t think The Great Filter is as &ldquo;mystical&rdquo; as that, it&rsquo;s an interesting take.</p>

<p>The other half of the book revolves around the men and their dilemmas. Do they continue their work at the risk of harming their loved ones? These men live and breathe their work. If something was impeding them from doing their work, which could be potentially ground-breaking work, why should they stop if it means elevating humanity? There is a sense of defiance in some of the characters that I admire. But also something touching as they mull over their loved ones and horrors they could put them through.</p>

<p>That being said, I feel like there&rsquo;s very little actual story in this little book. It&rsquo;s a lot of back and forth between characters about these two topics. Thankfully, the Strugatsky brothers do make the characters quite interesting and inject enough personal issues to make it fiction.</p>

<p>There is no wonder why the Strugatsky brothers are one of the greatest science fiction writers. They approach science fiction from a very human perspective. The human reaction to technology is core to science fiction and they just nail it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the author of <em>The Vegetarian</em> and <em>Human Acts</em> comes a book like no other. <em>The White Book</em> is a meditation on colour, beginning with a list of white things. It is a book about mourning, rebirth and the tenacity of the human spirit. It is a stunning investigation of the fragility, beauty and strangeness of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Don&rsquo;t die. For God&rsquo;s sakes, don&rsquo;t die.</em></p>

<p>I picked this book up at my local library. There is a display at the front where other library patrons suggest a book on certain criteria. If you like plot, you might like this book. Or if you like suspense you might like this other book. Mampreet suggested this book if you like prose. They didn&rsquo;t put any reasons but I trusted them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve actually <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/book-review-the-vegetarian-by-han-kang/">read and reviewed</a> <em>The Vegetarian</em> as part of a mini book club that I was doing with a friend. Everyone who read it was a little flabbergasted by it. There was something very Murakami-esque about it. But I couldn&rsquo;t deny that I really liked the writing.</p>

<p><em>The White Book</em> is very minimal. The text is sparse but I imagine every single word was chosen very carefully. I can only imagine how the translator might have laboured over it. It&rsquo;s prose to a tee.</p>

<p>In this book, Kang writes about her sister who only lived for two hours. In it, she imagines what her sister&rsquo;s life would have been like if she had lived and if Kang had never been born. Kang also talks about living so that her sister could live and being haunted by her sister&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p>This is definitely an artsy concept kind of books. The design is a dead giveaway of it. There is a lot of whitespace on each page. Some passages only use one side of a page. There are random pictures scattered throughout. If you enjoy fancy prose but don&rsquo;t mind lack of direction, you could give it a shot.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t tell if I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. And I feel like I experienced some beauty for a little bit but nothing too special.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At an isolated mountain hot spring, with snow blanketing every surface, Shinamura, a wealthy dilettante, meets Komako, a lowly geisha. She gives herself to him fully and without remorse, despite knowing that their passion cannot last and that the affair can have only one outcome. In chronicling the course of this doomed romance, Kawabata has created a story for the ages–a stunning novel dense in implication and exalting in its sadness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The summary of this book captures the essence of <em>Snow Country</em> perfectly. This book is dripping in implication. The characters are never straightforward. They all keep secrets or they are just distant enough from each other that you know as much as the narrator knows. Even if the characters state their feelings clearly, there is some hidden layer beneath the words that you know to be true. Honestly, all the implications kills me.</p>

<p>The sadness kills me as well. I was so emotionally affected by <a href="http://edelgrace.me/blog/book-review-thousand-cranes-by-yasunari-kawabata"><em>Thousand Cranes</em></a> that I immediately sought out another one of Kawabata&rsquo;s novels. There is something addicting about how Kawabata portrays sadness. Kawabata is no stranger to sorrow and he conveys it so beautifully.</p>

<p>I remember reading about Kawabata a while ago before I read any of his works. For some reason, I was reading about seppuku (might have been because one of my friends told me that samurais used to drink tea beforehand so they could empty their bowels before committing seppuku, cool fact) and I was reading about the last recorded instance of seppuku. The accomplished poet, writer, actor, and director Yukio Mishima was the last and he was a friend of Kawabata&rsquo;s. It is said that Kawabata was haunted by Mishima&rsquo;s ghost so much so that he in turn also committed suicide (although not by seppuku).</p>

<p>After reading <em>Snow Country</em> I went ahead and read some more about Kawabata. One article talks about his first love and how it fell apart. It was tragic.</p>

<p>While it seems so simple, two people are caught in a passionate but illicit affair, there is tragedy seeping in every single word, gesture, and thought in this book. It&rsquo;s hard for me to think about what even happens in this book because I was just so affected by it all.</p>

<p>Kawabata really knows how to write. I&rsquo;m losing my ability to write because I just can&rsquo;t come up with any words to describe it. I highly recommend it.</p>
