<blockquote>
<p>Across seven dazzling tales, award-winning internationally best-selling author Haruki Murakami brings his powers of observation to bear on the lives of men, who, in their own ways find themselves alone. Some a trapped indoors, some in their own heads; they are chauffeured around in cars by silent women or haunted by the ghosts of women they once knew.</p>

<p>Here are lovesick doctors, students, ex-boyfriends, actors, bartenders, and even Kafka&rsquo;s Gregor Samsa, brought together to tell stories that speak to us all. In <em>Men WIthout Women</em> Murakami has crafter another contemporary classic, marked by the same wry humour and pathos that have defined his entire body of work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like Murakami&rsquo;s characters. What I mean by that is if his characters were real, I would probably hate them all. But&hellip; Murakami is really good at writing interesting characters. They may not be likeable or all too believable but they do grab your attention. <em>Men Without Women</em> is filled to the brim with those characters.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, these are the characters that I remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>A plain look female chauffer who drives an actor around</li>
<li>An actor who is driven around and retells his story of his wife and her lovers before she passed away</li>
<li>A lackadaisical wanderer who lets his friend go on a date with his girlfriend</li>
<li>A middle-aged man who never stays attached to any woman until it happens and his heart breaks and then he literally starves himself to death</li>
<li>A man who every single person he has dated eventually killed themselves</li>
<li>A woman who thinks she was an eel in a previous life</li>
<li>A Gregor Samsa if he was like a bug or something and wakes up as a human</li>
</ul>

<p>There is one story that really stuck in my mind from this book, <em>An Independent Organ</em>. Dr. Tokai is a plastic surgeon who is also a serial dater. He doesn&rsquo;t like commitment. All the women he dates usually have a husband or a boyfriend. He enjoys how casual and short-term his relationships are. Until, one day, he falls in love. The woman he falls in love with leaves him for another man and from his heartbreak, he slowly starves himself to death.</p>

<p>The whole &ldquo;my heart is broken time to die&rdquo; thing isn&rsquo;t what I took away from this story. At one point in the story, Dr. Tokai talks to the narrator about concentration camps. He talks about an accomplished, wealthy man with many hobbies who is suddenly thrown into a concentration camp and is stripped away of all the things that defined him. Dr. Tokai was fascinated at the man&rsquo;s existential crisis as a result of this. In some way, I think Dr. Tokai starved himself to find out who he really was.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I fully understood this logic when I first read it. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to starve, of course. How could that intense starvation ever bring you to who you really are? To me, there is nothing more human than the performing arts or working or cultivating a family. Maybe they&rsquo;re just distractions to keep us busy and our real personalities from ever being realized.</p>

<p>Even now, I keep thinking I get the meaning behind it but I feel like I keep falling short of it. Is it about coping with loss? Is it about not knowing how good you have it until you lose it? Is it about stripping away all the bullshit and confronting yourself? Or maybe Dr. Tokai was so madly in love that all reason left him and he starved away his sorrows. I refuse to believe that is what Murakami wanted to portray. Still. It made me think for a couple of good days.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy story is <em>Samsa In Love</em>. It&rsquo;s a tongue in cheek spin-off of Franz Kafka&rsquo;s <em>The Metamorphosis</em>. In the original, Gregor is a human who suddenly wakes up as a bug. In Murakami&rsquo;s story, Gregor is a non-human entity who suddenly wakes up as a human. Gregor experiences falling in love for the first time after he meets the locksmith&rsquo;s daughter. Nothing profound, in my humble opinion, but a good chuckle. I appreciate the reference.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this might be one of the better Murakami books I&rsquo;ve read. There a lot of hit and misses from Murakami and I just keep reading them because they&rsquo;re so familiar to me. I think this is worth reading, however. I never really like how Murakami writes women in his main novels. Admittedly, this anthology doesn&rsquo;t differ that much from his usual portrayals but it is a touch more down to earth than usual and that I definitely appreciate.</p>

<p>Also. How does Murakami write so much???</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While attending a traditional tea ceremony in the aftermath of his parents’ deaths, Kikuji encounters his father’s former mistress, Mrs. Ota. At first Kikuji is appalled by her indelicate nature, but it is not long before he succumbs to passion—a passion with tragic and unforeseen consequences, not just for the two lovers, but also for Mrs. Ota’s daughter, to whom Kikuji’s attachments soon extend. Death, jealousy, and attraction convene around the delicate art of the tea ceremony, where every gesture is imbued with profound meaning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The past will always follow you. The main character, Kikuji, learns this first hand in <em>Thousand Cranes</em>. After the death of his father, he is pursued by women from his father&rsquo;s past. There is Chikako, a mistress that his father did not see for long and who constantly meddles in Kikuji&rsquo;s personal affairs. Then there is his father&rsquo;s main mistress, Mrs. Ota, and her daughter, Fumiko. These three women are haunted by Kikuji&rsquo;s father and turn to Kikuji to express their guilt, shame, and envy.</p>

<p>What really captured me about this book was just how irritating these characters were. Chikako was just downright annoying with her constant pestering. Mrs. Ota seemed utterly useless, just crying and (the way I interpreted it) longing for Kikuji&rsquo;s dead father. I had some hope in Fumiko, who seemed like the most normal out of the three women despite her insistence on absorbing the shame of her mother&rsquo;s affair with Kikuji&rsquo;s father. Then there is Kikuji who does nothing and whose only purpose is to serve as a vessel to experience the stories of these three women. I have never disliked so many characters in one book. I also have never wished for redemption for the characters so intensely.</p>

<p>The real kicker about this little novel, however, is how it is written. Kawabata&rsquo;s prose is hauntingly beautiful. I could feel his words to the core. When Fumiko threw down the Shino, I could sense the desperation and the sorrow. I could picture this woman and the expression on her face, and how her arms would carry the burden of the Shino and fling it to the ground, heavy. It was such a delight to read.</p>

<p>I will say that I feel like I should be over the trope of the frail, overly emotional Japanese women who changes a man&rsquo;s perspective on life only to, in the end, commit suicide. I don&rsquo;t know why this is so prominent in the Japanese novels that I have read. It must be cultural and I can firmly say that I don&rsquo;t get it at all. It does make for good stories, even if it makes it a little infuriating.</p>

<p><em>Thousand Cranes</em> was a quick read and I devoured it. Admittedly, I picked this book up because I thought it was <em>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</em>. When I read the summary at the back of the book, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t that book at all but I decided to take it out anyway. I made a good choice, I think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red Schuhart is a stalker, one of those young rebels who are compelled, in spite of extreme danger, to venture illegally into the Zone to collect the mysterious artifacts that the alien visitors left scattered around. His life is dominated by the place and the thriving black market in the alien products. But when he and his friend Kirill go into the Zone together to pick up a &ldquo;full empty,&rdquo; something goes wrong. And the news he gets from his girlfriend upon his return makes it inevitable that he&rsquo;ll keep going back to the Zone, again and again, until he finds the answer to all his problems.</p>

<p>First published in 1972, Roadside Picnic is still widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction novels, despite the fact that it has been out of print in the United States for almost thirty years. This authoritative new translation corrects many errors and omissions and has been supplemented with a foreword by Ursula K. Le Guin and a new afterword by Boris Strugatsky explaining the strange history of the novel&rsquo;s publication in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading more science fiction. I don&rsquo;t know how accurate that statement is because, really, I&rsquo;ve just been reading a lot of Ursula K. Le Guin and John Wyndham. Both authors approach science fiction in a way that appeals to me. They focus less on the flashy technology and the science but more on the daily and surprisingly human interactions between foreign entities, whether it be the subtleties between races on a planet or humans on a journey to a planet over the span of generations. Discovering new cultures or experiencing what-if scenarios of how humans would react to certain events is what I really appreciate in science fiction.</p>

<p>For some reason, I was a little dubious about <em>Roadside Picnic</em>. A friend of mine recommended this to me and it seemed like we were on the same page when it came to science fiction. I was a little skeptical when I learned that one of their favourite games, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> was based on this book. I&rsquo;m not someone really interested in shooters or high-risk treasure hunts. I gave it a shot anyway since the Strugatsky brothers are quite prolific and the premise seemed interesting. When I got my copy of the book and saw that Le Guin had written the foreword to <em>Roadside Picnic</em>, I was delighted. If my friend with good taste and my number one favourite science fiction author approved of it, it must be good, right?</p>

<p>As predicted, I was not disappointed!</p>

<p>First, let me gush about Le Guin&rsquo;s foreword for a second. Le Guin mentions the context that this novel was written in. Censorship was rampant during this time in the Soviet Union. In the afterword, Boris Strugatsky recounts many of the violations <em>Roadside Picnic</em> managed to accumulate, ranging from acts of violence to crude language to immoral behaviour. Le Guin so succinctly observes that science fiction (in Russia) is a way to write without ideology (in this case, Party ideology). More concisely, &ldquo;They wrote as free men write.&rdquo; That really hyped me for this book.</p>

<p>The universe of <em>Roadside Picnic</em> is soaked with subtle details of the daily lives of stalkers and the collateral damage they leave behind. The concept of the novel is somewhat simple: aliens visited Earth and humans go into those locations to grab whatever the aliens left behind for research, profit, or both. The tales that spin off from this premise are very compelling.</p>

<p>For example, one of the details I really appreciated was watching how Harmont, a regular small town near one of the alien visitation zones, changed and transformed over the years. Initially, the town attracted young people seeking adventure and get rich quick schemes. However, once the allure was ruined by the danger and the infeasibility of such dreams, the young people left or turned to less exciting ventures such as bussing.</p>

<p>While <em>Roadside Picnic</em> explores narratives from several characters, the character in the spotlight the most is Rederick Schuhart or as he is more known by, Red. By far, he is the most interesting character out of all them. When the point of view shifted to other characters, I was a bit bored (bar the one philosophical conversation that I found extremely intriguing). However, the Strugatsky brothers accomplished something in that although I was bored, the content was still important in contributing to the story.</p>

<p>Going back to the philosophical conversation, I love the analogy of the aliens taking a roadside picnic on Earth. The came as quickly as they left, leaving behind garbage that altered the lives of humans and generations after. Sounds familiar? It&rsquo;s just like when we go out in a hike and unintentionally disturb nature with our footprints, our waste, and our alien presence.</p>

<p>This book, overall, was a lot of fun. It is a quick read and although it took me a week to get through it, I found myself flipping pages frantically. I did not want to put it down (it doesn&rsquo;t help that when I read, I usually read on the commute and I can&rsquo;t stay on a train forever).</p>

<p>Another interesting thing that I really liked about this novel was just how Russian it is. When I think dystopian, I think of <em>We</em> by Yevgeny Zamyatin, who is coincidentally also Russian. I remember reading a review of <em>Roadside Picnic</em> that compares the two. They are entirely different but they both are extremely Russian. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but Russian authors have such a distinct voice that I am completely enamoured with. From Nabokov to Bulgakov to Dostoyevsky&hellip; I think I can now add the Strugatsky brothers to my list of Russian authors that I admire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hyperkinetic and relentlessly inventive, <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> is Haruki Murakami&rsquo;s deep dive into the very nature of consciousness.</p>

<p>Across two parallel narratives, Murakami draws readers into a mind-bending universe in which Lauren Bacall, Bob Dylan, a split-brained data processor, a deranged scientist, his shockingly undemure granddaughter, and various thugs, librarians, and subterranean monsters collide to a dazzling effect. What emerges is a novel that is at once hilariously funny and a deeply serious meditation on the nature and uses of the mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This novel alternates between two worlds. There is the &ldquo;Hard-Boiled Wonderland&rdquo; and &ldquo;The End of the World.&rdquo; The former takes place in reality, where the main character is racing against time to prevent &ldquo;The End of the World.&rdquo; Interestingly enough, the end of the world takes place in a single mystical village where people&rsquo;s memories of their past life do not exist. It is a utopia where everyone is assigned a task to do until the end of time.</p>

<p>After reading this novel, I came to the conclusion that I read too much Murakami. There is something similar across many of his protagonists that I just can&rsquo;t pinpoint. It&rsquo;s nothing too general like the fact that they are all men with strange thoughts about sex and women (although a lot of them do have that in common). Maybe I&rsquo;m just projecting but it seems like a large number of his protagonists are rather&hellip; Simple. Maybe even boring. They never think too strongly or feel too strongly. It seems like things are just simply happening to them and they are just bringing us along for the ride.</p>

<p>Which is why I breezed through the &ldquo;Hard-Boiled Wonderland&rdquo; chapters and absorbed &ldquo;The End of the World&rdquo; chapters as much as I could. The protagonist in &ldquo;Hard-Boiled Wonderland&rdquo; is pretty much the stereotypical Murakami leading man. In &ldquo;the End of the World,&rdquo; the protagonist is largely the same but also different.</p>

<p>There seems to be a real danger that the protagonist is trying his best to prevent. He does not want to lose his mind as he remembers it. Despite being really dull and drab in the real world, the importance of having emotions and memories is a great driving force for the protagonist. After falling in love with the emotionless librarian in the village, he is motivated to cling to his mind.</p>

<p>I was also pulled in by the fantasy aspects of &ldquo;The End of the World.&rdquo; The little village of people in an immortal land is just really interesting. I really wanted to uncover the mysteries of this world. The revelation in the novel was a bit of a disappointment but I enjoyed travelling and discovering the characters in this world.</p>

<p>However, being pulled back into reality is disappointing. While there was a real sense of urgency that I appreciated (really, I just wanted it to be over), I didn&rsquo;t feel the weight of the risk as much as the risk of never leaving &ldquo;the End of the World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really seem to make my mind up about this novel. I think this might be one of the better Murakami books but it still isn&rsquo;t great. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t reread this book, like I would say, <em>Norweigan Wood</em>.</p>
