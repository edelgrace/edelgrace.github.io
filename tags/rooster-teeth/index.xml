      <description>I missed yesterday as well. I&amp;rsquo;m just not very good at this! But I am determined not to miss today. Today I read on Zen Habits that you should never miss doing something two days in a row. It&amp;rsquo;s a good philosophy and a great motivation hack for me. By the time two days have passed, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that that task will never be accomplished.
So yes, it&amp;rsquo;s around 11:30pm and it takes me around half an hour to write at least 500 words.</description>

      <description>November is NaNoWriMo1. I know I will never be able to participate in NaNoWriMo. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to do BloWriMo: Blog Writing Month (which was technically last month, oops). Really lame, I know, but writing everyday is doable but at the same time, challenging. I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for at least 500 words everyday. Yesterday I only did around 440 words but that&amp;rsquo;s because I did not know that I was doing this.</description>
