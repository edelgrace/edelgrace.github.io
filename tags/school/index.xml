      <description>Today is the last day of school for winter break! Yay! We were supposed to have pizza but it never came&amp;hellip; We also watched a movie that I have watched too many times: The Polar Express. Then my camera ran out of batteries after I just took one picture of my friends. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great day, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad it&amp;rsquo;s just over.</description>

      <description>Today, my TA went to the church across the street to help out with the food hampers. Our job was to bring all 200 something boxes from the basement to the main floor. Do you know how hard that is? It was definitely a workout for me. I got my friend pat to help me with over half of my boxes and he calls me lazy. There was this freight elevator, and we had to bring carts full of food with it.</description>

      <description>Three days ago, I started school, and I found out that we no longer have homerooms. Now we have TA I went to my TA in the band room and found three grade niners there, and I thought I was in the wrong homeroom, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Oh and guess who my teacher advisors are? The principal and the vice principal! This is going to be one great year.
I have three of my friends in my TA and I have to stick with my TA Until I finish junior high&amp;hellip; b=Vleh.</description>

      <description>Beauti is a pretty good band. Right now, they&amp;rsquo;re on tour with this thing called Absolute. They travel all across Canada to high schools. Which really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense because I&amp;rsquo;m in junior high. Anyway, they played four songs (actually three, but they played one song while the kids went into the gym). I forget what one song was, but the two songs they played was Forever Love, and Don&amp;rsquo;t Watch Me.</description>

      <description>Hello! I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while. For some reason I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Geek Stink breath a lot. I miss the old GSB, when there were more people there. I still love GSB though!
I have been working on my religion project for the past four days. I&amp;rsquo;m finally finished now. Thank goodness. Who knew that a simple powerpoint about a saint would be so much work? I guess I&amp;rsquo;m too much of a perfectionist.</description>

      <description>My locker&amp;rsquo;s right next to the band room, and grade niners are constantly standing around my locker. The grade niners like to listen to this guy play the drums every single lunch period. I was opening my locker, and the guy who plays the drums was looking at my locker. They saw my Billie Joe Armstrong poster (which unfortunately does not exist anymore because one of my friends tore it up).</description>
