      <description>WIP stands for a &amp;ldquo;work in progress.&amp;rdquo; As an avid crafter and generally creative person, I always have at least one WIP!
 I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Wednesday to come around so I&amp;rsquo;m doing my WIP Wednesday now.
Right now I&amp;rsquo;m working on a shawl for one of my best friends. Just last week, my friend told me that she had cancer. She has had problems with her thyroid for a very long time and her family doctor never did anything about it despite her concerns.</description>
