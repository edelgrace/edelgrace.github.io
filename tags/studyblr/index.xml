I came to school on a reading day because I have a group project to work on. The meeting doesn’t start for another hour so I’m just going over my AI notes because I need to catch up on the material.</description>

Team messy notes 2015. My mind was blown away during this lecture. Honestly, some of the algorithm solutions for simple problems like finding the two closest points in a plane, are extremely interesting.</description>

It’s early morning and I’m trying to do some of my assignment that I should have started over the weekend but I was working on a group project instead. I really should learn to manage my time better.</description>

I came to school three hours early today (I start at 10) so I can get a head start on the exercises we’re doing today in tutorial. It’s just so awkward when the TA asks for the answer and no one speaks up.</description>

Finished making presentation index cards. I’m really bad when it comes to public speaking so I need to prep a lot. Most group presentations I‘ve had involved “just winging it” and that never goes well for me.</description>

I’m feeling super down for some reason right now and I can’t really pinpoint what it is. It feels like there’s a dark cloud looming over my head. I tried to make my notes look extra neat, neater than usual, as that usually helps me calm down whenever I do feel like this.</description>

My super messy notes (right) vs the rewritten version (left). During a lecture, neat and legible notes are the last things on my mind. Okay, sometimes I zone out and look down at my paper and think, “Wow, this looks horrible.</description>

Some pictures of my diy planner, taken with a potato. I borrowed inspiration from diyfish inserts. Whenever I open it up, I can see my whole month and reoccurring tasks right in front of me.</description>

In bed with Camus. A penpal recommended this book to me and he expects a nice, long essay about it. Okay, I think (and hope) that was a joke but I really want to be able to understand this so we can have a meaningful conversation about it.</description>

I’m taking a “zero day” from studying but that doesn’t mean you have to stop learning! I decided to work on my blog and switch frameworks from Bootstrap to Foundation, mostly because Boostrap has the potential to get really bloated and I find that Foundation is more intuitive and their documentation is great.</description>

I’m in the middle of trying out studyign{.tumblelog}’s method of taking textbook notes for my algorithm design class.
This was seriously a hard section to wrap my head around. Each step of computing a convolution makes sense but the big picture escapes me right now, especially since it involves complex numbers, which I haven’t touched those in years.</description>

Lunch break with cantaloupes and warm pandesal with cheese. I usually don’t like eating at my desk when it comes to breads, especially crumbly breads like pandesal but I was totally craving it.</description>

I forgot where I heard this tip but it’s good to read papers that are in your field in your spare time. I spent like an hour looking for PDFs that I didn’t have to pay to read when I remembered that my university library provides free access to databases and databases of papers.</description>
