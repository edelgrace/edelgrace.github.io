<blockquote>
<p>Red Schuhart is a stalker, one of those young rebels who are compelled, in spite of extreme danger, to venture illegally into the Zone to collect the mysterious artifacts that the alien visitors left scattered around. His life is dominated by the place and the thriving black market in the alien products. But when he and his friend Kirill go into the Zone together to pick up a &ldquo;full empty,&rdquo; something goes wrong. And the news he gets from his girlfriend upon his return makes it inevitable that he&rsquo;ll keep going back to the Zone, again and again, until he finds the answer to all his problems.</p>

<p>First published in 1972, Roadside Picnic is still widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction novels, despite the fact that it has been out of print in the United States for almost thirty years. This authoritative new translation corrects many errors and omissions and has been supplemented with a foreword by Ursula K. Le Guin and a new afterword by Boris Strugatsky explaining the strange history of the novel&rsquo;s publication in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading more science fiction. I don&rsquo;t know how accurate that statement is because, really, I&rsquo;ve just been reading a lot of Ursula K. Le Guin and John Wyndham. Both authors approach science fiction in a way that appeals to me. They focus less on the flashy technology and the science but more on the daily and surprisingly human interactions between foreign entities, whether it be the subtleties between races on a planet or humans on a journey to a planet over the span of generations. Discovering new cultures or experiencing what-if scenarios of how humans would react to certain events is what I really appreciate in science fiction.</p>

<p>For some reason, I was a little dubious about <em>Roadside Picnic</em>. A friend of mine recommended this to me and it seemed like we were on the same page when it came to science fiction. I was a little skeptical when I learned that one of their favourite games, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> was based on this book. I&rsquo;m not someone really interested in shooters or high-risk treasure hunts. I gave it a shot anyway since the Strugatsky brothers are quite prolific and the premise seemed interesting. When I got my copy of the book and saw that Le Guin had written the foreword to <em>Roadside Picnic</em>, I was delighted. If my friend with good taste and my number one favourite science fiction author approved of it, it must be good, right?</p>

<p>As predicted, I was not disappointed!</p>

<p>First, let me gush about Le Guin&rsquo;s foreword for a second. Le Guin mentions the context that this novel was written in. Censorship was rampant during this time in the Soviet Union. In the afterword, Boris Strugatsky recounts many of the violations <em>Roadside Picnic</em> managed to accumulate, ranging from acts of violence to crude language to immoral behaviour. Le Guin so succinctly observes that science fiction (in Russia) is a way to write without ideology (in this case, Party ideology). More concisely, &ldquo;They wrote as free men write.&rdquo; That really hyped me for this book.</p>

<p>The universe of <em>Roadside Picnic</em> is soaked with subtle details of the daily lives of stalkers and the collateral damage they leave behind. The concept of the novel is somewhat simple: aliens visited Earth and humans go into those locations to grab whatever the aliens left behind for research, profit, or both. The tales that spin off from this premise are very compelling.</p>

<p>For example, one of the details I really appreciated was watching how Harmont, a regular small town near one of the alien visitation zones, changed and transformed over the years. Initially, the town attracted young people seeking adventure and get rich quick schemes. However, once the allure was ruined by the danger and the infeasibility of such dreams, the young people left or turned to less exciting ventures such as bussing.</p>

<p>While <em>Roadside Picnic</em> explores narratives from several characters, the character in the spotlight the most is Rederick Schuhart or as he is more known by, Red. By far, he is the most interesting character out of all them. When the point of view shifted to other characters, I was a bit bored (bar the one philosophical conversation that I found extremely intriguing). However, the Strugatsky brothers accomplished something in that although I was bored, the content was still important in contributing to the story.</p>

<p>Going back to the philosophical conversation, I love the analogy of the aliens taking a roadside picnic on Earth. The came as quickly as they left, leaving behind garbage that altered the lives of humans and generations after. Sounds familiar? It&rsquo;s just like when we go out in a hike and unintentionally disturb nature with our footprints, our waste, and our alien presence.</p>

<p>This book, overall, was a lot of fun. It is a quick read and although it took me a week to get through it, I found myself flipping pages frantically. I did not want to put it down (it doesn&rsquo;t help that when I read, I usually read on the commute and I can&rsquo;t stay on a train forever).</p>

<p>Another interesting thing that I really liked about this novel was just how Russian it is. When I think dystopian, I think of <em>We</em> by Yevgeny Zamyatin, who is coincidentally also Russian. I remember reading a review of <em>Roadside Picnic</em> that compares the two. They are entirely different but they both are extremely Russian. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but Russian authors have such a distinct voice that I am completely enamoured with. From Nabokov to Bulgakov to Dostoyevsky&hellip; I think I can now add the Strugatsky brothers to my list of Russian authors that I admire.</p>

          <p><p>My last semester was extremely busy. So busy that I spent my commute on the train sleeping everyday instead of my usual reading. I&rsquo;ll admit, most of my reading is done when I&rsquo;m on the train. So other than the occasional manga or cookbook, I hardly read the last couple months of last year. Which is devastating.</p>

<p>This year (like every year), I resolved to read more. I started out the year reading two non-fictional books about personal finance. Good insightful content but hardly stimulating.</p>

<p>On impulse, I was at the library paying fines (my water bottle exploded in my backpack and ruined a book, I&rsquo;m still a bit peeved) when I saw <em>Emily of New Moon</em> by L. M. Montgomery on the shelf. I had just finished watching <em>Anne</em> on Netflix and I needed another dosage of Montgomery goodness.</p>

<p>Reading through <em>Emily of New Moon</em> struck something within me. Whenever I read good literature, I always have an urge to write. I know that I will never be as good as the authors that inspire me, but most of the time I just want to write for the sake of posterity.</p>

<p>In <em>Emily of New Moon</em>, the main character (you guessed it, Emily) writes letters to her father as a sort of journaling mechanism. This made me long for my journal. I have tried writing journals many times but my anxiety of my mother reading my journal has made me hesitate each time. I see this blog as a sort of journal but I still have to censor myself as this is (obviously) public. I do admire those who can freely write in their blogs but it&rsquo;s hard for me to take that step especially since many of my thoughts are so personal.</p>

<p>Reading about this little girl writing so freely made me envious. I started to write a little more in a notebook.</p>

<p>Then I heard about the passing of Ursula K. Le Guin. It&rsquo;s been around a year since I first stumbled upon <em>A Fisherman of the Inland Sea.</em> I was completely enamored by the book. When I was younger, I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy. Things like <em>Dragon Rider</em> by Cornelia Funke, <em>The Old Kingdom</em> series by Garth Nix, <em>Harry Potter</em> (of course), <em>The Last Dragon Chronicles</em> by Chris d&rsquo;Lacey, etc. There was something about being immersed in a totally fictional and supernatural world that I found captivating.</p>

<p>Le Guin is a master at creating such worlds, although she tends towards science fiction rather than fantasy (in my opinion). Her world building is expansive and natural and oh so imaginative (I picture Anne of Green Gables saying a similar thing with her eyes wide and her hands clasped).</p>

<p>Two of my friends are currently taking a science fiction course where they will eventually read Le Guin&rsquo;s <em>The Left Hand of Darkness.</em> I&rsquo;ve read a couple of Le Guin&rsquo;s books (mostly compilations of her short stories) but haven&rsquo;t touched any of her more popular novels. Thanks to the power of Audible, I managed to get a free copy of the audiobook.</p>

<p>However, listening to Le Guin&rsquo;s words just isn&rsquo;t the same as reading them. Maybe it was the narrator but I couldn&rsquo;t get myself into it. There was one scene that I could pay attention to but when it came to the description of politics and the general world, I couldn&rsquo;t focus.</p>

<p>So I made a trip to my local library to scout for some more of her books. <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> is a popular book and the wait-list for it was thirty people long so I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be reading that any time soon. But I did manage to pick up one of her books that were decidedly not science-fiction, <em>The Unreal and the Real: Volume One: Where on Earth.</em></p>

<p>I had barely read through the introduction and the first sentence of the first chapter when I put the book down. I instinctively shivered and got out my notebook to essentially write most of what I have already written here. It was a special moment. Le Guin had captured me entirely.</p>

<p>In a way, I&rsquo;m jealous at how beautifully Le Guin seems to string along her sentences. I&rsquo;ve never really had a way with words, especially if they come out of my mouth. I have to think slowly and carefully and even in the written form, I&rsquo;m not as eloquent as I wish I could be.</p>

<p>Even though I could never hope to be a master of words like Le Guin and Montgomery, I can imagine. I can spin tales in my head and conjure up these characters that seem real to me. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to capture their essence in the written form but at least they&rsquo;re something that I&rsquo;ve created. I think having an imagination is a wonderful thing. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve imagined anything and I&rsquo;m glad that reading has started my mind up again.</p>
