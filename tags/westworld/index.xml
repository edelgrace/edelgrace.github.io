      <description>Yesterday I went out with my SO for Vietnamese food. There&amp;rsquo;s a decently sized restaurant called Bow River Vietnamese Restaurant that&amp;rsquo;s close by his house. I regret not taking pictures but their deep fried wontons were delicious. It had a good amount of meat and perfect crunchy crust. The sauce they provided it with was good as well.
For myself, I ordered a regular beef noodle soup. In the soup was tripe, brisket, and beef balls in it.</description>
